 What’s the point of getting stronger in a world without the Great Demon King? That was my excuse for being unable to scale that wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though people around me claim that I am “talented,” I was never called a “genius”, a “monster”, or the “Second Coming of the Hero”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were times when I showed the result of my efforts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the words said at such times were always the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― As expected, he’s the son of a Hero
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t feel like I’m being praised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the words usually said during my off days, when results were lower than usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― In the end, he’s still immature compared to his father the Hero
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt so annoying!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it because I’m so spoiled that my heart gets dispirited?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father, one of the heroes who saved the world, married my mother, one of his comrades, and I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was raised without any inconvenience in a peaceful era without war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The country I reside in is the Depaltia Empire, which is considered to be the leading country of the world. Its level of civilization and economy may be the best in the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pampered, my wealthy family usually got me whatever I desired.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even attending the academy isn’t an issue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is how I was raised, thoroughly pampered yet receiving the best education possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was better than the ‘average’. Intellectually and athletically.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, until I hit that wall, and I never had to worry about the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He will succeed his father and become a warrior of the Imperial Army.” Without a doubt that was the path I was going down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But having bumped into the wall as I progressed, I was suddenly concerned with how I’m being evaluated by the adults and people around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what the result, no matter what I do, the title of “Son of the Hero” always followed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would always be compared to them, and my power would be inferior to that of my parents who were too great.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Believing that one day the blessed genes from my parents would awaken within me, I was consumed with improving myself through bloody efforts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was still unable to obtain the evaluation which exceeded parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The children of the other Heroes are full of wonderful talents. They will mature splendidly from now on, and lead the human race.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― However, ‘he’ is not enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― His genes should hold the most talent, but…… he’s merely… talented.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― He’s not even close to the geniuses who have real talent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I had high hopes, but my son is a mess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared with the children of the companions in the same hero party as father and mother, and I should have similar expectations as most of them from surroundings, but nobody has high hopes to me any longer, and I was treated as inferior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I’m not a failure. I’m obviously more capable than the norm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since then, the privileged position of being the son of a hero has come to feel more like a curse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Notice me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to be free. I want to go to a world where I won’t get caught up in that title.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the age of fifteen, I was in my rebellious phase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And during that phase, my path will be twisted contrary to the expectations surrounding me, brought upon by the fateful encounter which occurred.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Child… Can you hear my voice? Do you recognize my presence?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I had no idea how such a thing was possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Ten years alone with naught but boredom. You are descendant of my arch enemy but if I can kill time by possessing you there is no other choice. 1
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King, the nemesis of all mankind who in the past the races of the world came together as one and overthrew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, his soul was unable to pass on, and it remained in this world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why I was the only one who could perceive the ghost of the Great Demon King. No one else could, not even my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we still met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Hoh~?… feeling rebellious are we? You want to get back at your father? Do you want to get back at the world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it was there a strange codependent life begins.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I have a grudge against your father. Therefore…… shall I grant you the power to surpass your father?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s a ghost, and he can’t talk to anyone but me. He can’t do anything but haunt me and stay by my side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King who can communicate only with me and see only what I see offers whispers of the devil as a means to pass the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I shall guide you. I shall teach you anything, whether magic, martial arts, summoning, or wisdom. All I have is free time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What would have happened if I hadn’t met him back then?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a time when I thought of such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could have accepted the evaluations of those around me and lived a happy and peaceful life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, I’ll always say I’m glad to have met him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though meeting him, still lead to ‘the worst day of my life’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The worst day of my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To talk about it, I’d have to go back to the day I first met him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #fff">
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 S1 This was a though one. Ends up it was an idiom so doesn’t translate well. 背に腹は代えられない literally translates as “can’t change my belly on my back”. Seems to want to describe a situation in which you’d have to give up what you want for what you really need. Thanks to GoldStrength over on reddit for the help.
