 The bell rang, ending today’s class, and it became time to leave school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child. Are you done with school? If so, show me a little more of the Imperial City today.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, yes……tte.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even if I say I’m going home, it’ll be after several detours at the request of the Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t mind a little diversion, I wasn’t refusing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… Before that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, I can’t go home, I’ve become a supplementary lesson student because of you!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I am not at fault…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s really your fault!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, after all, the instructor was angry because I mentioned that absurd eye of the Great Demon King, so I’ll be staying for supplementary lessons after school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, if I thought calmly, the answer that the instructor issued should have probably been the right one, and yet… damn……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey…… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me as I was about to get up, there the princess was standing, coldly looking down at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Uum…… Princess… Phianse…… What can I do for you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked the princess who suddenly stood before me, while recalling that addressing her as ‘princess’ or using honorifics would be no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s really sudden, isn’t it? As I thought…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Earth. So, you’ve been intensely staring at me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It seems you had something to say to me, so I came here straight away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the class just now… no, I was caught in the flow of the conversation with the Demon King and just didn’t turn away, I wasn’t particularly gazing passionately at you…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, it’s nothing. Then I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, let’s get out of here before she complains about something. With that in mind, I slipped by Phianse’s side -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, don’t be shy! Well, I’m not blind or dumb, I understand! You have something to say. So I’ll listen to you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, eh, hold on, princess!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t address me as ‘Princess’ now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t slip past her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, really … what? She grabbed my shoulders as I tried to escape, and the usually composed princess was breathing heavily through her nose and drew closer to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Did I do something?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L-Look, you’ve resolved yourself to do something, li, like confiding in me over this and that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no, it’s nothing, really, nothing in particular…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeh, don’t be embarrassed! No, are you? Is it no good in front of everyone in the classroom? I’m sorry, I didn’t take that into consideration! Should we go somewhere else? Maybe behind the school building? A- alright, if we’re going then let’s go! I’ll follow like normal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 W-What? Behind the school building? Are we fighting? Is it duel? Or, why am I being challenged by the princess I’ve never beaten in a mock battle? [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, i, is it so hard to say? Are you thinking about the difference in status or something trivial by any chance? Then don’t worry. In the first place, your house is of sufficient status, my father and your parents are good friends, and they were talking about each other’s children in the future. In other words, there are no problems or obstacles, and the rest is up to us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good, I don’t know what’s what.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, really…… to not worry about the difference in status… does she mean we can fight seriously?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, during our usual mock battles, I always fight with all my power without worrying about the princess being a girl, and still lose… is this person not aware of that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey hey, what do you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Could it be, at last… Kyaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oi, are you serious?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going to happen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? By any chance, is this it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We are casually witnessing a historical moment that may determine the future of this country, aren’t we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the unusual excitement of the princess was naturally the center of attention in the class, and it was an atmosphere that seemed interesting to the others watching the interaction between us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, umm, I must go to the teacher’s office now for… the supplementary lessons…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, coward! That much…… A-are you that afraid of me? S-such a trivial thing, i-it’s not like you’ll beat me anytime soon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sorry that you’re a prodigy or whatever, but get off my case!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, Earth. This time… your match… the event to determine the strongest young warrior…… I’m sure you and I will be selected.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, haha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And, in my plan… well, the finals should be down to you and me, so intend to declare to everyone that I’m going to do something in the future. But you won’t even make the finals if you’re so timid!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? This princess, does she want to beat me up before the masses and declare her victory? Not sure that makes for a very good personality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “E, even if you say that… basically, I’m yet to be selected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m sure you and I won’t have a problem. Or rather, the world will want to see ‘the battle between the children of the Seven Heroes’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s true, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I said I’m not sure I’m going to be selected yet, but with my previous grades I don’t think it’s a problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, there is a trend that the world wants to see the event of “The Battle of the Children of the Next Generation of the Seven Heroes”, and as the princess says, she and I will definitely be selected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We have the top and second spots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But honestly, I’m really not keen on it. In the first place, I lost all my matches to the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah~, fine already! Goodness, such a coward… When you’re selected, you’ll take it seriously then, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, princess that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway! No, if you have something to say, then you’ll say it! Well, I didn’t think you would go about it in such a half-hearted manner, but, I want to be told… I, I’ve heard it’s what a man would want to say. So, anyway man up and say it! Well then!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, my replies and responses were completely ignored by a rough groan as the princess left the classroom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the interaction between me and the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Haah!… good grief.””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the classmates sighed in disappointment, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By my side, the Demon King with his arms crossed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Though she seems a child prodigy, the princess was unexpectedly clumsy [] … while you seeming to be talented are an imbecile.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh! W-what do you mean!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And, in addition, regarding you…you are so insensitive that I wondered whether you might be lacking something as a life form…rather than worrying me, you speed right past that into irritating me. You irritate me to the depths of my being.』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Or rather, as you , despite appearances, fail to comprehend it, what would you know about a person’s heart?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, I was viciously scolded and made a fool of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Okay, should I add ‘Dense Protagonist’ to the tags as well? Because seriously…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] There word used here was ポンコツ Ponkotsu, which wiktionary says mean ‘worn out’ and ‘no longer useful’. I figured ‘mature’ went better. Ignore. After re-edit, clumsy worked best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] This scalding take down is courtesy of [nobaraotome] over at reddit. My original attempt had the demon king more passive aggressively sparing Earth’s feelings. But him showing his disdain would mirror the reader’s feelings I believe.
