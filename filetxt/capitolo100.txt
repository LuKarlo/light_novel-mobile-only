 Compared to the Imperial Capital, the scale of the city-scape was still incomparable, but even though it was a secluded nation with no interaction with other countries, Cacretale was sufficiently developed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The area that seemed to be the center of the city is like a market, with many stalls like Cantidan, and it had been prosperous since morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What … it’s so peaceful … was there a civil war?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one seemed to be facing much hardship in their lives, and the peaceful citizens were laughing and lively.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! Good morning, Amae! Who is that? Amae’s boyfriend?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Brother, if you make Amae cry, I’ll never forgive you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, my proud apples! Have some!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first I tried to run and chase after Karui, but I wasn’t likely to catch up and I couldn’t run through the crowds in the market, so I slowed down a little bit, being careful of my surroundings. I seemed to stand out with Amae on my back, and various people called out to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, th, thank you …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, as an offering, two apples were thrown at me by a strange old man, and I caught them, gave one to Amae, and ran while I bit into the other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re popular, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I heard it was a secluded country, so at first I thought there would be a lot of gloomy people out there, but that’s not the case.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is it completely peaceful now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you don’t know what I’m talking about…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, are there any other amazing people besides the High Priestess, Karui, and Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uunn~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She doesn’t seem to have the same sense of dislike that she did when we first met, but this Amae kid was so emotionless that we can’t hold a conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, maybe because she’s still a young child, I don’t think she really understands her own country or the strength of the people around her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s right…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Goddess… amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… A Goddess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Amae suddenly whispered in my ear. Goddess?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A Goddess… the most mysterious thing after the High Priestess… is that actually real?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That person? But…… that High Priestess… called Tre’ainar a God … but she doesn’t look like a demon,,. she doesn’t look human either… well, I didn’t hear anything about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, who is that High Priestess?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what are you up to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Surely, what are you planning… Jamdi’el… besides, I am a tad concerned about the Goddess, but… certainly not…did she…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar nodded in agreement to my concerns.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, I’ve been wanting to hear your opinion, but you were so excited about the training equipment, so I didn’t… Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Didn’t Tre’ainar just say something outrageous?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, it’s a name I’ve often seen in textbooks and newspapers… wow, such a coincidence…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uhun, that High Priestess’ real name is… Jamdi’el. One of the Six Supremacy and Great Demon Generals, pride of the Demon King’s Army, who once went on a rampage in the world under the moniker of the ‘Dark Valkyrie’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no, no, no… it’s some mistake… isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the former boss himself said so… ah, that’s right… they say the Allied Forces were still looking for her… Oh, I see! That’s why, the statue of Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…then, you couldn’t tell me sooneeeeeeeeeeeeeerr!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suddenly shouted loudly, and both the townspeople and Amae gave me a surprised look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s impossible for me not to make a fuss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, really? You’re not messing with me. right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, tis true.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah, hey, then that’s not good for me! Because I’m the son of a hero…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed. However…… she is most likely aware… and it appears to me she acknowledges and accepts it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh? Why though? Maybe, I’m being held hostage…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, that will not be the case… just…… surely, she is trying to make you stronger and use you for some purpose.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s why I’m so scared! What is with you? I don’t get why you’re so calm! The other party is one of the Demon King’s Six Supremacy!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong… also, I am the Great Demon King …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah, aah … I see, hahaha. Yeah you got me there.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so Tis so, fuhahahahahaha!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hahahahaha… right, s- hey!!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the legendary Six Supremacy. Hiding out in a secluded nation! Moreover, refers to herself as the High Priestess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, I am not so at ease. Because she was a former vassal, a companion, and one of my six arms… I am deeply moved…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Really? Though halfway, you were so excited after seeing the Bench Press and stuff.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuh, I, I was not so buoyant!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, you were!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a lot of nostalgia and feelings about his old comrade-in-arms… I don’t know, but no matter who sees Tre’ainar as he is now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I-In any case, tis not that I do not think about such matters… Simply…… I just believe there is no helping the way things are.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Why is that? She’s a former subordinate of yours, right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly. And while Jamdi’el was undoubtedly a superb commander… on the other hand… except for warfare, there were times when her thought process was beyond comprehension even by my omniscience. In other words, tis a loss to take it seriously.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh, at?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A former subordinate, or a close associate in his inner circle. And yet, he could not understand her thinking, or something like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, all will be revealed soon enough… Indeed, ‘that one lacks proper communication skills’ …is what was once said』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, that’s a pretty awful thing to say about your ex-subordinate…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But even so… or rather, she will do you no harm to in the coming three months. Even if her thoughts are incomprehensible, tis not meaningless. To go through the trouble to abduct you and the provide to for you over a three-month period, she will protect you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I, is that so?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uhun, so focus on your training for now, rather than thinking on it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu, w, well…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong words from Tre’ainar as I was confused and flustered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, in a way, can I even get the answers to my worries when Tre’ainar can’t figure out at this point? That’s how it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a situation, isn’t there more to be done than that? And, that’s what came across.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yeah. Well, I lost to a Supremacy in the eye test… which I think is unfair, but… I lost overwhelmingly to other guys in terms of power and speed.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so… but on the other hand…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. I don’t know why one of the Six Supremacy was involved in this country and teaching many other things, but at least some of those she taught were overwhelmingly better than me in their respective fields.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you have time to worry about the mess going on in your life, you should work on your growth first since you have trouble understanding things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「All right! Anyway, I’m messing up my strength training… Someday, that Machio guy, I will surpass him!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. But tis impossible.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a calm retort suddenly crushed my thoughts as I pledged a new resolve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Muscle training has limitations. There are various factors such as genetics, skeletal and physical structure, race, and so on, but the limits of the person are determined from the onset.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, that … uh … that means…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, you still have room to grow… but…… no matter how much muscle training you do in the future, tis forever impossible to surpass Aka and this Machio in terms of ‘raw power’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wha… wh… tsu!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By the way, your speed does not even approach the full-body spring-like run of that Karui… In other words, in terms of ‘pure speed’, tis impossible for you to surpass that Karui.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eehh!!??」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Furthermore, Jamdi’el’s eyes are… among the three great magic eyes… called the Heraldic Eye… In addition to its various abilities, the basic eye performance is the highest among all living things in the world, regardless of the Surface World or the Demon Realm… with only normal eyes, you had no chance from the start.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing his speech, I’m reminded of that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day I first became Tre’ainar’s disciple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until then, when I was a magic swordsman and he asserted that I didn’t have the talent for it, he was saying the same thing now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have the magic and power of my father. That’s why it wasn’t suitable for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Back then… you complimented me on my supple muscles and spring-like body…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis far superior than others. However, in the world, there exists an upper level in the field of one’s strengths… so I heard… as I may have mentioned, a force that cannot be exceeded through effort… that is talent… same as magic capacity and magic emission… one born with a higher limit than others… we call that a genius.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I after all, never thought that ‘my current self’ would be the strongest person in the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if I continued to receive Tre’ainar’s Guidance, it would be the case for ‘my someday self’…… there was the expectation I had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there are still walls that cannot be overcome.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Well then…… how can I grow in the future… what should I work on…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A world where effort can’t help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought I’d be told something so shocking while I was piggybacking a little girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……you, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On my back, Amae asked me with a curious expression. But now I couldn’t respond at the moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because if what Tre’ainar said was true, what should I do from now on…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However… from the previous battles and the ranking table, while you cannot beat Aka and Macho in power, at this point, you are already winning in terms of speed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『On the other hand, the Karui girl is certainly first class in speed, but when it comes to power, you are far superior… even Jamdi’el… in terms of pure power, cannot contend with you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That seems right, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So it was back in your home, was it not? That Second Sword Saint surpassed you in swordsmanship, but you overwhelmed him. You did not fight directly, but you would not lose to the son of that Great Mage in close combat either… do you know why that is?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar pushed me to the limit while asking me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are people who have more power, speed, swordsmanship, and magic than me, so I can’t be at the top in those fields.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he also said that there are areas where I am better than they were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What exactly does it mean? That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if you cannot win in one field… with the overall score…… in other words, with the sum of your strengths, you can win.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「O, overall…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. In the Imperial City, you may not have been able to defeat the princess in overall performance, but that was simply the matter of the school records. As you are now, your fighting power is more than enough to surpass that girl.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, maybe, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Therefore, what you should do from now on… rather than intensively training one thing, train all fields in a well-balanced manner. This was clearly evident in the Max measurement. We did not measure the speed, but I can predict the approximate figures based on my life so far. As far as can be seen numerically, you have no weaknesses.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of making a field or specialty that no one else could match, train everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was Tre’ainar’s guiding policy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that was a little too subtle to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In short, that… doesn’t it speak badly of me… as a jack of all trade, master of none?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have been told since my childhood. I’m better than others to a point. But, to put it bluntly, I’m a jack of all trade and master of none.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s because to me it was a curse that I had been told since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for me, Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why would that bode ill for you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There is no ill to speak of, if anything you may impudently say you are an all-rounder, could you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An all-rounder, not a jack of all trade… it was the first time I’ve ever heard someone say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are a little mistaken. A Jack of all Trades is by no means a demerit. …… you have no special talent. But…… that does not mean you are inferior… that is to say, there is no flaw that seems to be a weak point. And there is no greater nuisance in combat than the absence of a weakness. Because, compared to the fellow with only one talent, there is no ‘if you can just deal with it, you will be able to manage somehow’ scenario, and there is no strategy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No weaknesses, no strategies. Come to think of it, I… had nothing I was second to none in… but on the other hand… there wasn’t anything that I wasn’t good at…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If a broad and shallow term like Jack of all Trades still concerns you, consider this. What you are aiming for is… to learn everything extensively and intimately… to have Dexterous Affluence!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… ha… hahaha…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And… I … call those who show prominence in a single talent ‘specialists’, and those who excel in everything, ‘generalists’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From a serious looking Tre’ainar, the words “dexterous affluence” and “generalist” came out for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was funny… but…… I didn’t quite get it right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Dexterous affluence… Generalist… hey…… All-rounders who can do everything… it’s not easy to do… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I can’t imagine it… I don’t have an example… that I could use as a goal…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was called an All-Rounder, yet I didn’t have anyone in mind to use as a model or a goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Princess? However, as Tre’ainar said, I don’t see myself losing to the princess in terms of combat power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Sadiz? Certainly, Sadiz may be the most versatile. But, unfortunately, I don’t know Sadiz’s true fighting capability.

 So even if I set a goal, I don’t know how good it would be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahahahahahahahahaha!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar laughed loudly at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did I say something so funny? When I think about it, Tre’ainar is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. You are a tad heartless, are you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Have you forgotten? What you should aim for… the world’s best all-rounder… who knows you well…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh!? Well, are you serious? What? Who are you talking about?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I didn’t really understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Who is it? Who else… but the one that is always with you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah … that’s right … he was in front of me …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahahahahahahaha! Do you want me to say it myself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I didn’t even notice this sooner, I was laughing out loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. I was getting guidance from the guy I should be aiming for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, again, you, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Oh, oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Scary”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was a little frightened by my sudden burst of laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I hope you’ll forgive me for this one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, we’ve arrived.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, school.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While saying that, Amae was patting my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was talking a lot, so before I knew it, I had already reached the front of this country’s magic school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a big school building and the playground attached to it was beautiful with a well-maintained lawn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was still unaware of the future and my newfound determination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve interacted with academy and magic school students from other countries, but this was the first time I’ve ever set foot in a school in another country.
