 “Let’s go”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it really okay for me to go in, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I came to deliver the uniform, can I enter the school?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… let’s go”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, fine, I get it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little bit, Amae patted me on the head as I was wondering if I should go in or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I stepped through the school gates, thinking I might as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, where’s Karui? There are quite a few people in the schoolyard and I don’t want to be seen too much… ga…… un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, the schoolyard was full of people… huh? I mean…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… I wonder…… this school… there are only girls here, right? Is it an all-girls’ school …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sweet scent was drifting from all over the school premise. There were a lot of girls in the schoolyard… no…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong, child, there are males as well…… surrounded by little females…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah. I noticed it, too. There certainly was a male student.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he was surrounded by girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s how this school teaches it… in passing…… look, if you do it this way, you’ll be able to cast magic more efficiently.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Oh, I see. I hadn’t thought of that idea… Amazing!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boy explained some theory to a lot of female students, as if he were in a blue sky classroom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A black-haired male of medium build.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, transfer student! No chanting, cast a test spell. So… why, what’s with the power of this magic!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I was told to do it normally, so I did it normally, but… I didn’t expect you to be so surprised … was it a little too weak?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no… no, I mean, it’s enough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Amazing! What power!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A group of students were lined up in a row. They were trying to hit a straw doll with magic released from their hands, but only one of them was very powerful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that line.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s just like Fu. There are guys like that everywhere.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I muttered unintentionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I give up… even though I didn’t want to stand out…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””What are you talking about even though it’s so amazing?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing? I have no magical talent, so all I can use is Bit Fire …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Bit Fire with that power!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amazingly, there are many female students around the few male students I could see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, aren’t there far fewer male students?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn’t the gender balance weird?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, except for the teachers, is there only one boy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, well… it’s impressive. Good performance. Developing countries are…not as I expected…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Well…… Tis so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the magic level of that boy is quite high.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reminiscent of Fu, who was said to be a child prodigy, he is likely to be a top-class student at the Imperial Academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Will this guy participate in the tournament in three months’ time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not quite as shocking as that Machio’s numbers or Karui’s running, but it’s quite exciting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Amae. Is he famous, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t you know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, Amae doesn’t seem to know much. She tilted her head and didn’t seem particularly interested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, transfer student. Certainly, the power of that magic was ok, but it’s all too self-styled… how to knead magic and posture… see, you need to focus on these fundamentals…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After witnessing the boy’s magic, a man who seemed to be a teacher was giving advice on “how he better do it like so”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That would have been a very common sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who decided that the way the teacher described was right? I think that kind of conventional teaching leads to the destruction of each individual’s personality. Students need guidance that further develops the individuality…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh-uh, wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In order to do that, we have to respect the students’ autonomy and let them do what they want to do… because students are not puppets of their teachers. If you don’t, you won’t think for yourself and you won’t be able to grow in life.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s quite the dispute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, the troublesome type… I feel sorry for the teacher. Come on, let’s go while we can.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Troublesome… you are actually saying that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’m very obedient and charming, aren’t I? While thinking so, I ignored the situation in the school yard, and looked around with Amae searching for Karui…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I don’t see that girl.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t think she’s in the schoolyard, so I guess she’s in the school building …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, I shouldn’t have come this far and just had someone call her at the school gate from the beginning…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ah …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re just realizing that now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought we were both acting careless, so I chuckled a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what are you doing there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, I’ve been discovered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A schoolgirl, probably younger than me, found me and shouted in a loud voice
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, fiercely glaring at me, the girl carried a sword on her waist…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve never seen this guy before… You, stranger! I will cut you down, suspicious bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Flabbergasted. A real sword was pulled out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this moment I realized the seriousness of entering a school in another country without permission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why would a student normally carry a sword around during class?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ah, I’m sorry! I’m not a suspicious guy, so I’ll stand down now! A student of this school forgot their things, you see, this little girl —”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Oi, child … from the sky …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sky. Tre’ainar told me to look up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Late, late, wh, kyaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A girl’s voice from the sky. Looking up I saw… the sunset?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow! I don’t know why a girl fell from the sky, but… anyway, it’s dangerous, so let’s avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mooove.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, my bread!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, a girl who flew in the sky with a broom appeared while holding bread in her mouth, which fell straight down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Late? Are you just arriving at the school?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When does this person come to school with a piece of bread in her mouth while brushing her teeth? What a vulgar fellow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Kya, my skirt!? …… Hey, did you see it? No, no!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, she got angry for some reason. She fell, and the legs were spread wide open, revealing what should be hidden… orange of the sun at sunset… no, it’s morning now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s obviously an accidental pantsu, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I didn’t use a Canonicon!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… Shame on you! Die!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pervert!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Now…… am I really in the wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instruct me, almighty master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Hey, what’s going on… Hey, what are you doing? Who is that man?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the commotion spread to the schoolyard in an instant, people began to gather, and a black-haired guy stepped forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The teacher… ah, not good, I’m in a lot of shock, my head was swooning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the girl who suddenly pulled out the sword and the woman in orange panties instantly ran up to the black-haired guy when they saw him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Se, senior! This guy, this shameless trespassing guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Listen, th-this person, saw my panties! Only you… sh, showed you… I didn’t… I’m t-tainted…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two girls moved to either side of a black-haired guy as if they were saying ‘my position’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah I see…… that’s how it is… these girls, they’re his hanger-ons…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… this is what you call culture shock. They are hair-raisingly annoying women…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Do not say too much…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess I’m the one at fault… well, it can’t be helped, but… it’s kind of annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s that? You…… I don’t know who you are… breaking into this school… what you did to my friends.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, he looked angry about the follower’s panties being seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The black-haired guy was kind to the girls earlier, but he had murderous eyes for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s regrettable, unfortunate. I’ll explain the situation properly……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! It was an accident… to start with, I’m here because a student of this school forgot their things —”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Annoying, shut up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, eeeeehh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bam, the black-haired man trampled on the ground with anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow… he didn’t listen to the situation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “F, friend… Hah~…… friend~… this, dense”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As usual, senior is so thick-headed. But I won’t give up. From the time I lost one-on-one to senior, I will have senior’s children ————”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, what’s with your lewd faces? Ah~, really annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Both of you, step back. This is my… eh? Come again? I didn’t hear you, but did you say something?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Again, thickheaded!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And don’t make me repeat myself. Don’t draw your sword easily. To swing a sword is to cut a person, to kill a person, to be cut yourself, and to accept the weight of the resolve to be killed as well ————.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Senior…… ♡”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is bad… I never thought I’d get this much culture shock…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wonder … this may be the first time I’ve ever felt like punching a man or woman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I don’t care about his face or his name. Anyway, it’s too much and I don’t want to talk with him for even a second…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t forgive anyone in the world who messes with my friends! I won’t forgive you even if you apologize! Ba…… oh, hey, wait, where?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to fight back, send him flying… but I will bear it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, if you don’t forgive me even after apologizing, why would I associate with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keeping in mind that this is the culture of this country… for the time being, I ran away while carrying Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or rather, I didn’t expect to be treated like that… well, I was the one who entered without permission, my bad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, you could have told me first, don’t go in without permission.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously, well, you didn’t tell me… now, what do I do about this… at the school gate, some people are standing around and keeping watch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, I thought I would run away, but people were waiting at the entrance, probably to keep me from leaving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now… do I run up the wall from the back?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I went around to the back of the school building, not in front of the building… thereupon……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Nu-!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””……Hmm?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And thereupon, I had an encounter, damn it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah……Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””…………?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were male students sitting in the corner behind the school building in a ridiculously gloomy atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I misunderstood that this school was an “all-girls’ school?”, but there were such male students.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no, I’m sorry… oh, I’m not a suspicious guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a little unexpected, so I tried to excuse myself quickly. But for some reason, all the boys there had eyes that seemed terribly dead or cursed by the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They looked right at me, and they knew I wasn’t someone from this school, but nobody seemed interested in me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””……………””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the awkward silence continued, and I couldn’t stand it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daaah, I’m curious! You, just who are you? Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His unkempt hair, and his uniform out of sorts, this vulgar male student was picking a quarrel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But soon…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey hey, stop that, ‘Oratski’. That’s how you immediately pick a fight …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut it, ‘Mortriage’, you may be curious too! How long will you keep acting like an honor student, broke aristocrat!”

 A blonde with well-ordered features. To all appearances, a wealthy noble son…… looks aside however, his uniform was riddled with dreadful patchwork, yet he tried to calm the boy who was looking to rile me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fight, th, that’s no good! Might be a transfer student, w-we don’t know!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh. Let’s get along like normal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, ‘Budeo’! ‘Mobner’! You guys…ah~, whatever, don’t care!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then the other boys stood up, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, an extremely chubby guy and … well, a normal and featureless fellow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After being warned, the guy looking to fight clicked his tongue and sat on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, sorry about that. Are you a transfer student? Perhaps the whole school atmosphere was too much for you to bear and you came here too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ah, no, uh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nice to meet you. I’m Mortriage. ‘Mortriage Revive’. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boy introduced himself with a refreshing smile and offered his hand to shake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the other guys …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bo, Budeo… ‘Budeo Hamsan’, wh, what!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m Mobner. ‘Mobner Victor’. Thanks. Hey, Oratski, you too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch… ‘Oratski Friend’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys introduced themselves one after another… as if to welcome a “new comrade”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thus, dozens of guys would introduce themselves to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I really didn’t want to get involved with them, so I tried to get out of there as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t realize that this encounter was the start of the revolution of the disadvantaged boys, the first since the country’s civil war ended.
