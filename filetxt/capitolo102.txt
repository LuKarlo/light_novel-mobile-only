 Let’s get out of here soon…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My father was an aristocrat of the old regime. He was captured during the civil war, and is now imprisoned and his house has fallen into ruin. Until then, I too was surrounded by a lot of girls… and got a little full of myself before that… I wonder, am I being punished? After my father was imprisoned, the girls around me did an about-face and started speaking ill of me and snickering at my expense… at one point, I had a political marriage arranged with the daughter of an old acquaintance of my father that involved the reestablishment of my family, and I’m only 15, but when the wedding ceremony was being held a few months ago and I was about give a kiss for my vows… the man who is in the schoolyard now showed up and said, ‘This sort of marriage is wrong’. Then stole the bride, and that girl even cried, ‘Take me!’. It was too much, so much that I couldn’t keep up…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I thought, but I found myself sitting there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait a minute!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the beginning, I was listening to his story, but I suddenly yelled out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell, that bitch! Who runs away in the middle of their wedding? That damned annoying woman!? I mean, who had to pay for the ceremony?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From what little assets I had left in the house…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, no, it’s not the marriage that’s wrong, it’s the THOT! Talk about troubling others… so, where is that woman now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, out in the schoolyard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Mortriage pointed to the schoolyard from the back of the school building, among the girls flocking the black-haired guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Where did that pervert go? I’ll definitely get him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve incurred divine punishment, haven’t I? Yesterday, we didn’t tell anyone, but… we were on a date, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I heard that too! So unfair! I will not allow one person to monopolize that cool guy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Have you forgotten our love alliance? Apart from that, you can’t judge a boy just by his looks… though he is certainly smart looking, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Senior, is that true? You two were on a date… that’s cheating!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, well, I guess it’s one of those… I wonder… I’ve never spoken to them before, but I thought it would be nice if everyone exploded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mortriage is still fine! Me … I found a girl who was lost in the city and when I tried to help find her parents together, I was arrested because they thought it was a kidnapping of a little girl. And the girl seemed to have a sister in my class, and the next day all the girls in the class treated me as a criminal… u, uuugh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s beyond the level of pity… who the heck is that girl?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She’s in there, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Budeo pointed to the schoolyard while crying, well, yes… she’s among that group of girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keke, what about me? The first day a transfer student moved into the school, I called out to him, thinking I’d be friendly, and he said, ‘Shut up!’ then ‘Bang!’ I hit him and sent him flying over the desk as it is. But, the girls in the class praised me going ‘so strong~’ and so on… what the hell is that? And yet, the girl sitting next to me looked down on me saying I’m a savage and the transfer student was a smart honor student…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s the transfer student’s fault no matter what you think, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me… nothing in particular… if I dare say, a childhood friend who lived next door is … in there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder. Everyone was living a very sad student life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for some reason, I don’t feel like a stranger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By no means, but I don’t feel like leaving with “Well, it’s none of my business”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… effort, talent, circumstances, and various other factors… lead to the existence, of those sorts, too.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, sitting with me next to me, also had a subtle expression on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, well, that’s fine, isn’t it? As far as I can tell, they’re all bitches, right? They hate me so much… or rather, here in this place, and with all these bastards present, why don’t you all just parade around and have a good time together?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””……………”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just not the same anymore. This atmosphere made any words of encouragement seem to ring hollow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not what I’m talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… geez… I got roped into something weird …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but swoon, wondering what was going on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There you are, you suspicious bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I found him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, here they come…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey? What’s going on? That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait! It’s not safe for you to be out here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right~, there are a lot of scary boys over there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t worry, if they try to do something, then I’ll knock them down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The schoolyard bitches pulled the black-haired guy along, and then showed up to the back of the school building.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, with a lot of hostility.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh … in a place like this … why, were you with these guys?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ugh…””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for the boys behind the school building, they were all backing away, looking a little frightened of the black-haired guy and the girls, as if their hearts were completely broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you can’t run anymore, can you? I’m not interested in those who sneak away, and I don’t want to pick on the weak, but I won’t tolerate those who make girls sad and run away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The black-haired guy who caught up stared at me with a glaring eye and talked confidently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……What? Girl…What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Made a girl sad… Who’s running away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… you … eh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Floating through my mind… Sadiz’s voice calling my name. Mother too. The Princess…… doesn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The black-haired man may not have said it with a ‘that sort of intention’, but… surprisingly… to think he would touch that wound with pinpoint accuracy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… restrain yourself…… do not be so dejected… tis unbecoming, is it not? Besides, these ones… pose no threat.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As my irritation was growing and wondering what I was going to do about it, Tre’ainar said that at just the right time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… What do you mean?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Comprehend my words. I do not give instruction to help you torment the ignorant youths of a developing country…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s… true.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I said so in Cantidan as well, did I not? Even if you over-overwhelm a small fry and get on top, on the other hand, it makes you look small… as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Haha……」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fist that went out… but…… I just grasped it and endured it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes… that’s right.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know. I raised my fists, which I almost swung, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eeehh!!!???”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Actually, I’m just here to deliver some things a girl named Karui’s forgot, along with this child, Amae, on my back…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ah! That child… from the church… and Karui, surely, wasn’t there a student like that in the freshman class?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wouldn’t have been a hassle if I had done this from the beginning. If I had apologized honestly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So ―――― please give me a break. Forgive me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was grinning beside me as if he was testing me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s fine, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey… he’s already… apologizing so much, so please forgive him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B… big brother Mobner… cough… Senior…… humph…… still as jittery and timid as ever, a real softy. Despite that…… I can’t stand it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, before I bowed my head, Mobner intervened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the sight, the strange woman with a head for swinging a sword clicked her tongue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, this is the childhood friend who lived next door that he was talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I don’t know what happened, but he’s being the adult and really apologizing with his head down… let it go… consider his feelings.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oratski… you’re still the same… man or woman, in the first place, the most important thing in an apology is the heart, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A girl with glasses and a punctual impression. She felt like an honor student or a chairperson…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, calm down! Th, this is a peaceful place!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geh!? Budeo!? Hey, I feel sick, why this criminal perv… ugh, the worst …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, she’s kind of vulgar. Wearing make-up and the uniform to make an appeal like ‘I’m cute, right?’, it seemed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you don’t have to say that… even if Budeo is… such a bad guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Stay away from him… I heard he was a kidnapper…… after all, bad people cover for bad people… Mortriage…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seemed like the most mature, and the most harmless at first glance, even though she looked like a small animal, she said the ugliest things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah… I see… the guys looking out for me and the specific girls reacting to it… ah, with a combination like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, all right, that’s enough. It looks like I’m messing around with him… but you’re a real coward, to apologize all of a sudden after being scared. The other boys too. You should all learn a little from José.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I found the general correlation, orange panties said in an elaborate manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now I heard a black-haired guy’s name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I don’t want to stand out fighting in a place like this… ‘Chiyo’… is that okay? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. But I don’t want to wear these panties anymore… boso… Ehehe, I wonder if José should pick out some new ones for me to wear ~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I hope you explode… ah, but it’s been solved for the time being, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, um, that’s really my bad. Well then I’ll be going. Oh, thank you guys, thanks for covering for me. Then, come on, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That solved the problem… So…… I silently passed by…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um~… ah~… um, it might seem meddlesome, but… you boys there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eh…???””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not my problem anymore. I know, but somehow I can’t leave as it is, so I looked back…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It may be none of your business, but… don’t just linger there. Try to do something else. In three months’ time, there’s that Arcane True Zenith tournament, right? So, like, as a man, go ―――――.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””‘Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I could finish saying everything, the girls’ unpleasant laughter echoed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m surprised… the Arcane True Zenith tournament… that’s the battle between the hero of the revolution, Machio, and José, isn’t it? Well, the winner will be José though!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t laugh, Chiyo. Fufufu, but… there were boys other than José in the tournament? I never even thought about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no way these ugly bastards are going to compete in a tournament like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And even if you do, you’re no match for José…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it’s true. We don’t know much about the strength of the hero Machio, but either way, José’s victory will remain unshaken.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, seeing their reaction, I’m reminded of that, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the High Priestess … I mean, Jamdi’el also said something like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since it was almost certain that Machio would win the championship if only the Arcane True Zenith style was involved, she also allowed the students of the School to participate so as to increase the number of contestants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dear oh dear, don’t flatter me too much. I’m just a former villager who has nothing to do with the Revolutionary Army guys or the wizards.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really! Just a villager, even though you just transferred to another school and did a lot of things in a few days!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Jamdi’el still said that Machio was the clear winner, but these guys believe differently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I know not about that Machio yet, but… tis enough from the figures on the bench press and that Jamdi’el affirms him. And … this little José boy… well, he seems fairly capable, but… rather, if this little boy by any chance… hmm…… just a villager… if not of a wizard’s lineage…he may be using ‘that’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said, between the opinion of these girls and that of a former Six Supremacy, which is more reliable, it goes without saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, even from my point of view, this José is… well…… with his body build, the amount of magic I felt… he’s not weak… that’s what I sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, maybe you’re going to be participating in the tournament too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The black-haired guy asked me. So, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. Forcibly, but still.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Then I’ll pay you back for what you did to Chiyo today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Discipline … So accidental pantsu…… Well, there was a time when I never wanted Sadiz to show what’s under her skirt to any man but me, so I don’t know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yeah~, for making your girlfriend cry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Girlfriend? Who?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I don’t want to wait three months, I want to bludgeon him now. This guy is not very smart, is he? Why don’t you understand the flow of the current conversation? He’s missing an important thought process as a person…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For you of all people to say that…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, what’s wrong with Tre’ainar? Why are you looking at me with pitiful eyes there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yeah? Girlfriend? Oh, hey, we look like that! Even though he’s a pervert, he’s a good judge of character! Yes, and eventually… Hehe, I’m Chiyo! ‘Chiyo Lowing’. I’ll be the wife of the strongest man in the country, so remember that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, being so happy about my remark, the girl was suddenly smiling and huffing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even if you introduce yourself, I’m not going to remember it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no! This girl is delusional! Rather, I will be the wife of the coolest man in this country! Menk. ‘Menk Ishregal’, remember it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even though I didn’t ask the vulgar woman as she went all huffy, she introduced herself…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? I, is this an introduction tide? Fuh, hun? I am the wife of the most righteous man in the land… My name is Soud! ‘Soud Cranam’! Remember, you rascal! Next time you do anything else, I will cut you down with this sword of justice!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, even the weird girl with the head for swinging a sword around gave her name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha… Me too…… I shouldn’t miss out… right…… I hope to be married to the best honor student in this country… Glass… ‘Glass Waller’.”
