 “No way~, thanks a lot, big brother. And thank you too, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a critical situation at the back of the school building, but I managed to let it pass, and soon found Karui.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When she arrived at school, she realized that she was empty-handed and in her church habit, so she was loitering around the school gate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Amae still got to enter the school grounds with big brother. Did you make a scene~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Well …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I… made a scene…… In the end, it was settled peacefully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I just met some annoying girls… pitiful boys… a strange guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, big brother, that’s splendid~, such a harsh thing to say… well~, this school, it just gives that~ impression?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui laughed bitterly as she guessed what had happened from my subtle expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, it might seem conceited but how should I put it… What the hell is up with that? Umm, that José guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, senior José. Well, big brother met someone amazing all of a sudden… the female seniors around him were amazing too, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was annoying. I hope they will all be unhappy together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahahahahaha, harsh! So harsh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this school. There seems to be a lot of different people, but all of them were influenced by the student life, centered on one black-haired guy named José. That’s what made an impression on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Senior José seems to have transferred from another school before I enrolled in the school… it’s just a rumor. He was from a rural village that had never produced any magical school students, and he was looked down on by everyone at first, but suddenly he showed a ridiculous power even though he says ‘I have not trained properly before’ and suddenly became a celebrity. His strength, magic, and the kindness to girls, got all the girls in the senior class excited. So, all the senior boys lost their place and were thrown to the corner of the school building one after another… just tottering around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~… That’s right. But you have talent…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I think I had enough power to be that confident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, no. Either way… in three months… the winner won’t be that José guy…… nor Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter who I talk to, what I’m going to do won’t change.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I’m looking forward to seeing how strong I can be in these three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The people of this country and the wizarding school, what they’re going through, who they are, what they’re all about, are not that much of a concern for me right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~… so cocky~. You’re going to beat Mr. Machio, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I haven’t met him yet, so I still don’t know how strong he is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nyahahaha, you’ll see him soon… but, uh… yes, I’m looking forward to it! I’m rooting for you, big brother! Of course, Amae also supports you, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui laughed somewhat happily at my declaration. And waved to Amae as if teasing her, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un… not possible…-ish.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle, stronger, than this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, hey! Let’s cheer for big brother there! Amae wants sister to be happy too, right? Besides, Uncle, Mr. Machio is still in his twenties!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since she was a child, she was not afraid to give her pure opinion, but I was called ‘this’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, this guy… don’t tell me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahaha… sorry~… well, for me and Amae, when our parents died, Mr. Machio is like an older brother… like a dad. To Amae, Mr. Machio is the strongest in the world. I think~ “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hee… Well, then you’ll have to be sad in three months… but…… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I heard a little of Amae and Karui’s sad past without delay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I didn’t say anything more to Amae’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m going now! Oh, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I signaled Amae that we were going home right away because my business was done, she nodded and jumped on my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui also smiled at Amae’s manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! Amae~, splendid, you’ve let your guard down around big brother quite a bit. This guy~, if you got her to trust you right away, you’ll soon have the senior girls of this school latching on to you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, you’re outrageously forthright… aren’t you interested in that José guy too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nyahahahaha, aren’t you saying too much? Well, me and senior José… come on, I’m sure he’s an amazing guy, but the High Priestess is far more amazing, I’m not interested in romance right now…… or rather, I don’t think senior José is that cool.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t really get the appeal of that black-haired guy… I wonder…… all the same, he might be the most decent guy in this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good. Well, there seems to be no decent guys in this school, so if you’re not interested in love, that’s good. Then I’ll be going now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, later!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. Then, see you at the church big brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 According to Tre’ainar, the High Priestess, Jamdi’el, was also quite like a crazy woman, so I was relieved that there was a decent girl like Karui in this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although her legs were superhuman, she was a normal girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought that being normal would be so precious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been frustrated since I set foot in the Wizarding school, but that made me feel a little better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, hold on tight, Amae!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you won’t get shaken off, will you? Quickly, let’s train, we’ll run a little on the way home, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay. Karui, faster.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you said it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Amae on my back, I turned and ran back the way I got here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I could only learn the way, I could run without getting lost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was humming happily on my back as I went faster than I had been going.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… say…… Tre’ainar… when we get back, where do we start?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The training menu. I’m full of motivation today. I’m gonna do whatever it takes, okay?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do I use all the equipment in the dojo?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, according to Tre’ainar, I should aim for dexterous affluence, so I’m sure I’ll be given a variety of menus to train in a well-balanced way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, it kind of reminded me of the days when I was training in preparation for the previous match, and I got a little excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah! Then, shall we warm up already?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perform Magical Parkour. The little one will be glad as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, I see.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded to Tre’ainar’s suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would be boring to just run normally while carrying Amae to the church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, it would certainly be nice to double as a warm-up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, Amae. Are you ready?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I may be a lot slower than Karui now, but … I can do this too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I’d have a little fun for a while, and I smiled. Let’s go, Tre’ainar, come on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now… Slant!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run straight and cut at an oblique angle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jig out!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Quick Out!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uhmm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Slice-in! Hook! Hitch! Long Post! Square-in!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah! I’ll do it all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm♪ Hmm♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical Parkour that I did in the forest before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After resting my body to top physical form, I felt that I was able to run sharply, even though I was inferior to Karui in speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, child. Your power and speed, as well as visual prowess, you have greatly improved the way you use your body in your previous battles. Now, not only in Magical Parkour, but also in Magical Ladder, your movements will become remarkable.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not my self-esteem, but my master’s approval.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like Amae, who for a while has been in high spirits on my back, my own feelings were uplifted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, if you only train in the same steps and footwork, you will get ‘used to training’. Once you get accustomed to the training, the application in actual performance will be difficult once you encounter a scenario different from what was practiced… as such…… I previously had you doing Magical Ladders for warm-ups, but I shall incorporate something different in the future.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, right away? Practice a new step. I’m curious…what are we doing?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A new training to further improve this sharpness that I already thought was in good shape at this point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rope-Jumping.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Formally called… Magical Jumping Rope!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rope?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jumping rope…… no, even in the dojo… there was a guy who was jumping around with a rope…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, really… for sure, when I saw the guy jumping around, I wondered what he was doing…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufu, were you surprised? Well, tis no wonder. On the Surface World, you do not think much of the jump rope. Well, I suppose tis only seen as a plaything for children, but… Fufufufu…… do you not underestimate rope jumping?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just spinning a rope and jumping so your legs don’t get caught in it… but… eeh? How is that going to help me practice the steps?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It was a simple orthodox jump in the dojo… however, the jump rope is deep… the way you jump, the rhythm… and even the way you move the rope allows you to perform a variety of techniques.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, te, technique? It even works on technique?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. So once you reach the dojo, take a breather… first of all, image training… for the first time in a long time, use ‘Fantasy Magic, 【Vier】’』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vier. The dream world I imagine. For me, that’s the space where I can face Tre’ainar directly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I haven’t used that magic since I left my match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In that world, I can embody the rope jump, so I shall give a direct demonstration there.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… eh!? Ah, you… with that rope… will you jump?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmmm, be amazed. Once, in the Demon Realm… I held the record of the 30-fold jump… furthermore, I was deemed the ultimate performer, with my Demon King Technique!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar had a ridiculously smug look that said “look forward to it”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I remembered the first time Tre’ainar demonstrated the ladder steps, and just imagining Tre’ainar jumping over that rope, and I almost burst out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see…… earlier, I had to resist hitting those irritating guys, but now I’ll have to resist my laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Oi.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah, my bad…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, the determination in my heart was out of the ordinary. Tre’ainar looked a little bit puffy, but soon returned to his original smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis fine. If you can laugh, you should laugh… once you master the Ultimate Jumping rope technique, everyone will surely be amazed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Tre’ainar full of confidence, the days of training began once again.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
