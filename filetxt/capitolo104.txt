 Training in the Vier World with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s been a long time since I’ve been here, and also it’ll be a new menu, so I was excited to activate the magic…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now then, I shall perform the Magical Jumping Rope!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Oh.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Holding a rope in his hand, and I materialize the same thing as Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, Tre’ainar will first demonstrate it, but before that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「By the way, Tre’ainar… what’s with that outfit?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I am in the mood.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar had changed his outfit. Somehow, he was wearing hooded clothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, clothes were somewhat kind of dull, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This is Magical Parka… the clothing is called Magical Sweatshirt… tis proper etiquette to wear such attire… when jumping rope.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? R, really? Well but…… it’s kind of a stylish…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Do you not agree? Uh huh. Tis is hooded clothing called a trainer. Tis comfortable to move in or laze around in your own room, and I developed it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh, it’s cool… a trainer… I like this kind of thing, you know?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Uh huh, you have quite the discerning eye… hn? …… hnn?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What’s wrong?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nothing, yes… well…… umm? What?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What? So I like this hoodie and… trainer thing.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……Oh, oh……」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What the hell, you turn away and hide your face!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, no, tis nothing… Kohon… So let us get started.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After Tre’ainar somewhat deceptively coughed, he started the special training again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then tis a jump rope, but… before putting it into practice, I shall first explain the effects of jumping rope.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「First of all, rope jumping is a training that can be done anywhere so long as there is a rope and a small space. In addition, tis possible to train the muscles of the entire body in a well-balanced manner with numerous variations, number of repetitions and duration. For example, ‘Rhythm and Step’, ‘Wrist and Whole Arm’, ‘Stamina’, and so on.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, as with the ladder, we start with the explanation of the effect as before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I straightened my posture and nodded obediently as I listened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Rhythm and steps. This is important for those like you who use quick footwork by constantly moving their feet in small increments.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fully understand that. I always move my legs to keep track of the timing to avoid the opponent’s attack and to hit my own attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Of course, you can learn steps and rhythms with the ladders, but unlike ladders, if you do not jump with the proper rhythm and timing, your feet will get caught in the rope … like so…… Basic 【Great Demon・Front Leap】!」 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s started! It’s finally happening!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t laugh・Great Demon King!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar looked serious, spun the rope on the spot, and jumped nimbly on both feet with a constant rhythm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fufu Osu!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And simply spin the jump rope like so, but while keeping the wrist at a constant height, and repeating with the same rhythm… sometimes moving the wrists and gain momentum depending on the technique. … 【Great Demon・Back Leap】.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar continued to jump, spinning the rope in reverse rotation, and still without getting his feet caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「If you do this for a long period of time, it will be a reasonable load, and your wrists and arms will be strengthened… And at the same time, by using the arm in rhythm well, the arm also learns the rhythm… of course, there is also the leg you are jumping on… 【Great Demon・One-legged Jump】… Twice right, twice left, alternating left and right…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There it is! T, Tre’ainar… on one leg, is hopping! It’s been a long time since I’ve seen it with the ladder!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But once I saw it… no, the technique doesn’t work on me! Endure this too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In addition, once you get used to it…… 【Great Demon・Running Leap】, watch that your feet do not get on the rope or …… 【Great Demon・Weaving Leap】… … Cross your arms!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, oh… Huh, that’s just plain awesome! Hey, it might be a little cool…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Furthermore, variations that move your feet … 【Great Demon・Cross Foot 】」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「With both feet open left and right, cross your legs while jumping… Ufu-ah!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Increase the difficulty level, 【Great Demon・Hopscotch】! 【Great Demon・Split Hop】!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, s, see here!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on out, I’m not sure what to do. Jumping with both feet and stretching back and forth, crouching, landing with heels with toes raised and jumping again, no… yeah…… it’s amazing, but… depending on how you look at it, it’s usually cool… b, but, somehow, m, make things well up…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Furthermore, to rotate the rope twice in a single jump, 【Great Demon • Double Jump】! Triple! Quadruple! Stack it fivefold, and this also naturally raises stamina by doing it for a long period in a constant rhythm so as not to become unnatural! And in order to keep jumping for a long time, you also need to concentrate, tis naturally a part of the training!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar jumped silently while wearing the hood, and the vigorously spinning rope made a whistling sound. It was so fast that I couldn’t see the rope anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And jumping rope is a whole body exercise! You can do this too! How to jump to train your upper body other than spinning the rope … first, sit on the ground!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when it hit me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar sat on the spot with his legs straightened out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Jump while sitting. You cannot use your legs, so of course you must use the recoil of your upper body to jump!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, no, I have a bad feeling about this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the? Tre’ainar suddenly turned the rope over his head as if it were a lasso…!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In this way, the rope that had been spun vertically is now spun horizontally… tis taken from top to bottom like so… I jump while sitting on the ground … its name is …」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good! Don’t do it, Tre’ainar!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The world’s latest Great Demon King who once shook the world, leaving his name in both history and mythology.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King of terror who stood at the top of many races, led armies of tens of thousands, and reaped the lives of tens of thousands in battles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On his shoulders, with incalculable fame and infamy, he must have carried the lives of tens of millions of souls, both friend and foe alike.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, Tre’ainar. I can understand! Even I, a kid who has never been to war, can understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The existence of the Great Demon King was not just his own. In the title of The Great Demon King dwelled the feelings of countless people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why the Great Demon King carried a certain “weight” in its existence and name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why the Great Demon King shouldn’t do that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「【Great Demon・Butt Jump!! 】」 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Bwaaaaahahahahahahaha, dowaaahahahahahahaha!! Giyaaaaahahahahahahaha!!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To reward Tre’ainar’s feelings for seriously giving me guidance… most importantly, all of the training methods that Tre’ainar taught were excellent… so it’s all the right stuff… that’s why I shouldn’t laugh… it’s rude to laugh… But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Daaahahahahaha! And, Tre’ainar jumped with his butt on the ground… oh, can I jump ass? Gyahahahahaha!!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「………………」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… isn’t this impossible?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe even if I was told that the world would disappear if I laughed, I would definitely laugh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rope which was rotated at high speed and he jumped with the butt. It was so fast that you can hear the banging of the Tre’ainar’s ass going Don Don on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve already laughed and rolled around on the spot, and finally I’m even in tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… 【Super Great Demon Spiral】…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hi, ha, haha, haha……heh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, with the vacant voice of Tre’ainar, a huge shadow enveloped me as I was lying down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked up, I saw… a humongous spiral… the size of a mountain…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah, umm, ma, master…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The world of Vier is convenient… while you may feel pain… no matter my efforts, you will never perish…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was smiling very much, he doesn’t evoke a speck of kindness, just a scary smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, no, wait, Tre’ainar! Oh, I did my best! Well, I endured it!? Besides, the butt jump is a foul! It shouldn’t count. No- count -no- count -no- count!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「… tis already out at that point … foolish disciple of mine…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I did my best to endure laughing in my own way. But is there anyone in the world who wouldn’t laugh at the Great Demon King’s butt jump? So please forgive me for jumping ass.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it seemed Tre’ainar wouldn’t be satisfied unless he completely annihilated me once, every last pound of flesh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ma, master was cool! Really! Super amazing! Cool! I love it, really awesome!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu … i, is that so…?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, I really respect you! I’m glad I met my master! Really, I’m really happy to be a disciple of my master!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「U, uh huh… t, tis so… d, dear me, this hopeless disciple… t, that being the case… you imbeciiiiiile!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And before I started training, I had become dust for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ladies and gentlemen, as always I am indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This work has finally achieved “100 chapters”. Thank you for always reading.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday was 99 chapters, but due to the prologue, there was a person who gave “Congratulations” a little early, I am deeply grateful again and I am totally naked and driving!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s been three months since I started this story… I didn’t think I could get this response or drill from many spiral friends. It was my first experience with a spiral force of 80,000, so I’m always excited. For the past three months, I was wondering if I could somehow respond to everyone, and I had a lot of trial and error, I was about to catch a cold, and I was looking back at my hair again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I haven’t run out of things I want to write, even after 100 chapters, so I look forward to working with my good friends and teachers, thank you in the future!
