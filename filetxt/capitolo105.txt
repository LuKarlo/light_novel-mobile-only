<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After a round of image training and punishment, we returned to reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I opened my eyes, I saw a mirror in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, it seemed that I was meditating before training on the first floor of the dojo, so no one had bothered to talk to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when I got up and picked up the rope jump, those who were training in the dojo and Amae, who was reading a book beside me, looked up to watch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuh… 【Great Demon・Front Leap】…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The basic jumping method I was doing in the world of Vier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was my first time doing the real thing, but as I imagined, I could jump without difficulty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ready? Do not jump by the inertia without a set frequency or duration. Decide on a break. At first, I guess…Three minutes. Then, with an interval in between, another three minutes to jump in a different manner.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, don’t just jump like an idiot, also set a limit and concentrate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, check your posture and form as you jump by looking at your whole body with a big mirror.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon • Double Jump】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”OooooooaaoO””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one particularly reacted when I was just jumping normally, but when I showed off various techniques such as double jumping, they started to sound impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That newcomer, isn’t this his first time with a Magical Jumping Rope …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, but how to use it and how to jump … even the double jumping is done properly …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such reflexes, he’s pretty good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m being praised for many things, but this much was fine because I’ve done several image training sessions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, I was instructed by the Great Demon King the entire time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~… un, un, un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, when she saw me jumping, maybe she wanted to do it too, Amae took out a small jump rope that seemed to be for children, and started jumping hard next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, you’re good at that, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unfmm~ ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae smiled in good spirits when complimented. While I’m relieved by such an interaction, I was warming up my body by including variations such as running foot jumps and one-legged jumps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, it was easy at first, but as time went by, the load gradually increased throughout the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder it’s so effective if done as a daily warm-up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, it doesn’t need a certain amount of room like a ladder, so it was very convenient that you can do it anywhere as long as you have enough space to spin this jump rope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unfmm~, skip skip skippy~ skip ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is it a game? But I’m more amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooh~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And best of all, children can play with it. In other words, training that anyone could do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watching Amae do the front leap and the back leap as she hummed, I felt once again how great this training was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how we trained in front of a mirror, the two of us…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~. So the shy Amae has taken to thee already. Thou is quite the caring sort, it seems.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess smiled pleasantly as she approached us during the training and called out to us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I remembered once again that this High Priestess was Jamdi’el, one of the Six Supremacy and a Great Demon General.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does thou like children?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not, particularly that way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmmhmm, aren’t children adorable? If so, what does thou think of having a child of thy own? To be precise, would thou have a child as soon as thou finds a partner, does thou want thy own children?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no no no, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the heck? I was so glad that Amae and I got along a little better, then Jamdi’el with eyes wide open came close to me and asked that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, do I want to have a child? Do I want children? What is this fellow saying all of a sudden?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would me just getting along with Amae tell her that I like children and want to have children myself?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, that’s what Tre’ainar was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar didn’t understand her thought process.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this what he meant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, not particularly… to begin with, I don’t even have a girlfriend… well…… even if I did, that would still be a long way off, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told Jamdi’el that as I was jumping without losing my concentration, keeping the rhythm of the rope jumping from being disrupted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, having a child … means you’re going to do that, right? I mean, that kind of thing is only given after getting to know each other better… and getting married… in the first place, me as a parent…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, my father’s face came to my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn’t get along with my parents myself. There was no way I could be a great parent, and I felt sorry for such a child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, but if I get married to Shinobu, she would put a lot of effort into our children’s education… what am I thinking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not yet… the future? Well, what do you mean the future? If you say the future, how far in the future? How many seconds in the future? How many more revolutions will this world turn before then? No one knows what the future holds. People can die at any time. Thou may die just by missing a step and falling down the stairs. But, before? Why not do it while thou still can?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, Jamdi’el didn’t like my answer…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does thou believe the future is always guaranteed?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some words of weight and sense were thrown at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as I listened to those words, I looked at Tre’ainar next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe Jamdi’el uttered these words because of this Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, even the Great Demon King dies. That’s why no one is guaranteed a tomorrow or a future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can I put it off? Shouldn’t I do it while I can? And, surprisingly, those words gave me a lot to think about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, such heavy words……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or could it be thou… is not yet familiar with coitus?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I did that a long time ago!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This woman easily made me mess up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, yelling, I inadvertently my leg missed the jump rope and caused a blunder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is coitus?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t need to know that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Amae tilted her head a little with a scowl on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By no means, at that age… to not――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m full of energy every morning!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… But even so… eh? Well I never, thou has a taste for ages similar to Amae… scoundrel, Per――――” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold it, bitch I love sexy bodies!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I denied it out loud to Jamdi’el, who was giving me a newfound suspicion. Somehow, I feel like I shouted something that I slightly regret, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu… Sexy body… I see, if that’s the case… For example, so would it be better to have larger breasts, for example?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, wait, wait, what are you even talking about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Breasts… ‘that one’ is still developing… yet, I still have hope… besides, it’s not so much about size, rather the shape is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if she thinks anything about what I said, she’s mumbling something… so, it’s weird… what is she thinking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said she was not good at thinking, but somehow—
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phew… Osu. I’m back now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the door to the dojo opened…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hoh~ …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The person who came in…… the man caught my attention, and Tre’ainar’s, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou has returned?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Master…… Are you inspecting today?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I suppose. What of Tsukshi?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She said she’ll do some shopping and then come back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the man came in, I felt the room temperature in the dojo increase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Osu!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sweated from the whole body, steam rose, and I felt like the other people who were training at the dojo firmed up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~llo~… Uncle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae… don’t run around in the dojo too much… you’ll get hurt.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unh~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And you shouldn’t touch me right away. I’m covered in sweat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae also threw the jump rope and happily ran to the man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing that, I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, even if I didn’t see anything like that, I already knew the moment the man walked into the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The atmosphere was clearly different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A physique that if a hundred people were asked, a hundred people would say it was huge. However, to be honest, if it was only height, there might be bigger guys, and in terms of race, Mr. Aka would be bigger. But this guy was not only big, but his density is amazing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well-developed muscles that could be seen even from the top of clothes. The arms, the neck, the legs, and everything were thick like a log, and yet, at a glance, had a hardness and craftiness to them. [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… a fine physique… the face is appealing as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a finely-chiseled, dark face and short hair, the moment he entered the dojo, his eyes had radiated an uncanny spirit, but as soon as Amae came running up to him, his eyes softened warmly and he smiled at her with a fatherly atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then our eyes met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…You’re a stranger… is this a newcomer?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s right. I brought him in.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You did, Master? …… is that right… you’re young…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. He is about two years younger than Tsukshi… how does thou see him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The muscular man was staring at me while talking to Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe this guy is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m amazed. At this young age… this body… a thick core from head to toe … I also feel the flexibility of his muscles… he has both power and speed… what’s more… a style that has been through a number of battles… where did you find such a gem?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked at me with a straight face and praised me normally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, well, not easily. I intend to have him compete in the tournament three months from now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment he heard I was participating in the tournament, the man’s eyebrows moved slightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Uncle… he’s a little strong and a little fast.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So it was a bit interesting. It was fun.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m glad, that’s good. Did you say thank you properly?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~? …un…un,”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae tugged at the man’s trousers and told him so… a little bit… well, I’d like to say thank you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You? You are the strongest, Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I intuitively knew that this was a rumored Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I asked him, and the man laughed a little bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The strongest… I’m not that smug, but… I’m sure I’m Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Huh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. I said I wasn’t smug, but for a man to come face to face with me like this and look at me with such warlike eyes… it’s the second time… since Bro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Bro? Heh~…… is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It seems to me that you have courage and guts… as expected of someone brought in by the Master.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow … this was a completely different type from the strongest José of the Wizarding School.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, too… you look pretty tough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could see from his appearance that power to the extent that you felt it overflowing from his whole body, but he doesn’t let himself get carried away by the power, it’s not humility, he just does not neglect to improve himself, a stoic eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I don’t think this was the kind of guy to uselessly flatter his opponents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I was a little embarrassed when such a man praised me so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, do not let the poisonous air out of you… this is the one to defeat, is he not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I began to think, ‘Isn’t this Machio a nice guy?’, the voice of Tre’ainar called out a warning to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Apart from that José guy, I have to fight this man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although, I know he’s strong, but at the moment I don’t know how strong he is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that’s the case … this is … a dojo …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry for troubling you but, could you spar with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Wha…haaaaaaa!!??”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just have to check out his skill head on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This man was totally different from the magic school boys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t hesitate to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My proposal raised a voice of surprise all at once from within the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Oi! Don’t just call the FBI on our boy over that! Such slander!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Until we get an illustration, I’m imagining [Brock Lesnar’s Ring Entrance] … soon!!!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
