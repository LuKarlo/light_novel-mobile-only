<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is a dojo. A place where you can have mock battles. So, I could just try him out as normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, my remarks clearly got the people inside of this dojo abuzz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey… this guy, what is he saying all of a sudden?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As Machio’s… s, sparring partner?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, idiot? You wanna get wrecked?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, you’re kidding, right? What a naive kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since coming to this country, I received culture shock in various ways, but I’m reminded that these reactions are universal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t mean us trying to “kill each other”, but it’s quite grandiose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Spar with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I guess up to this point the person in question, Machio, had been far too strong for this kind of invitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, someone said earlier how, “They don’t have anyone he can spar with “.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So he looked puzzled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, although I made the invitation, I also felt that I should really do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Spar… Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That would be “concern” for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although it’s a spar, I’m sure he’s wondering what he’d do if I got hurt or something… this kind-looking man was pondering… yet he doesn’t even know what I’m capable of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Mr. Machio. You’re a lot bigger and much older than I am, and it might sound naive to you, but… it’s okay, right? You don’t have to fuss about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There are some men in this world who are more hurt by concern for being weak than they are by concern for being hurt.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m worried about my weakness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t forget that wound.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right? Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A close friend who cared for me and walked away from me for my sake because I was too weak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had never been so heartbroken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sandbag, was it? This sandbag. Well, if you don’t have a partner or if you want to check your form, just punching this is effective enough… as a man, Tsue…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I set up in front of a hanging sandbag right next to me. I’ve never hit it before, and at a glance it looked hard, and the contents were bulging.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Corkscrew Blow!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Won’t you lend me your time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I slammed my fist into the sandbag, twisting it like a screw, and my fist penetrated, and the contents violently blew through it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha!? Hey, eh, eeeh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ba, ha? Th, the sandbag… was punched through!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That, the first time I’ve seen it except from Mr. Machio!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Um…… as expected, I figured Machio could do this much, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I could do the same thing, then that’s something that no one else in this dojo but Machio and I can do…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… you…… of the country… no, a guest from outside the island.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unlike myself, to whom this island nation is everything in the world… what you are aiming for… what you’ve seen is fundamentally different… that’s why I feel a different vibe from the youths of this country.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh I see… in this country, which was basically isolated, there was no interaction with the outside world, so they don’t get involved with guys from the outside world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, Jamdi’el, who wasn’t actually human, may fool around with things as a High Priestess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a very rare experience to work with such a man. I’d be happy to oblige.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, okay. Well, no need to hold back…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio agreed. The surroundings were still buzzing about the decision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master, are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Do as thou would please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only Jamdi’el didn’t interfere with our exchange, but rather just observed it with interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go to the third floor. There’s a ‘ring’ there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ring?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, without stopping the spar itself, we moved to the third floor to spar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wa, wait a minute, are you really going to do it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously… well, I’ll go check it out!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m really anxious!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, why don’t we call the city guys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That Machio, even though it’s just a spar, he hasn’t been in the ring in a long time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku~, the hype! We get to see Machio’s show again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then all the guys who were training until then stopped, and followed us up to the third floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Show? What are you talking about? It’s sparring. A mock battle even.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While wondering in my mind, we went up to the third floor. And what I saw was a square shaped space of a certain width, surrounded by ropes wrapped around four pillars, set up in the center of the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what is this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the ring. On this, we spar in this limited space.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was shown something quite unusual, and at the same time I felt “small”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Up until now, I’ve been fighting in fairly wide spaces, in the academy, during the match, and in actual battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I myself used a close combat fighter, but I used the environment extensively to disrupt the opponent with my footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So this limited space… like a steel cage, it was the first time I had ever been so confined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The ring… in here, the fighting tactics in itself changes, there is no escape, so you cannot hide in the middle… fail to constantly move your feet, and you shall immediately be caught and done in, will you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That so… Well, I’ll test out a lot of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately, I went up to the ring and got in. Checking the feel of my feet on the floor and the size of the area.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this limited space, using footwork to toss your opponent… it’s going to be pretty difficult… you would need fine movements of your feet, not just goose steps and such.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, shall we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Machio also came up. Only taking off his jacket, his upper body became naked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was involuntarily taken aback by this giant man, his muscles were so bloated and well-trained that they were stunning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fighting this person in such a small place… although…… if it’s just the height, Mr. Aka and Toulowe were bigger. I don’t need to be scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I decided to fully indulge myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ready, both sides. Ring the bell… begin!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, Jamdi’el rang the bell. That would be the signal for the spar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the bell rang, I first tried to run around the ring to see how well my feet would work in this space. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Come… Come on”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as we started, Mr. Machio set up in the center of the ring, low on his haunches, with me in front of him, and the form of his hands, as if he were trying to grab me with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~…’Four Hands’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words I heard from the mouth of Tre’ainar, who was watching from the corner of the ring. Four hands? What does that mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that’s not the point…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio had not moved even a single step, he was holding the center.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I felt some kind of pressure as if being squeezed somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the problem was those two hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t sure what it was, but…… my instinct was telling me that those hands were abnormally “dangerous”. Don’t get caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phew…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t done anything yet, and I was about to be overwhelmed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I started by calming myself down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, you would be left defenseless by doing this in the middle of a fight, but since Machio didn’t seem to be making a move on me, I was able to do it without problems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Breathing …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el under the ring murmured, looking at me with interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, she knew the effect of this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But anyway, I calmed down a little … Come on …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~ … right, let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……… Come on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I run at high speed around the opponent in the center of the ring, so he can’t catch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was at the mercy of speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, oh! That kid…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not just power at that age, but speed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run around at high speed, and then, and from here, start hitting left consecutive shots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hou”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First, one shot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio couldn’t avoid it. My left hit Machio’s shoulder… Huh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… h, how!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio didn’t seem to care about my left shot, and on the contrary, it hurt my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt like steel, which made me wonder if it was really human muscle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch…but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that agitating, although I clicked my tongue unintentionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, it’s important that my left hit suddenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I somehow understood that he was wearing heavy armor of muscle. Machio couldn’t keep up with my speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Flicker!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I steadily hit with consecutive strikes of my whip-like left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t stop, and from the front, back, left and right without a break, I hit Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… those movements… better than in the previous match I saw… in just a few days, it seems he has become even stronger… more and more…… I’m looking forward to it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was saying something, but my fists struck Machio’s skin and was drowned out by the dry sound like a whip.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraaaa! My hands won’t stop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dry sound continued to resonate. All my attacks hit Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from dodging, he’s not even defending? Is his reaction too sluggish?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s not just cheeky.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I can’t see any of his punches!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My fist was hitting, but it wasn’t resonating with Mr. Machio’s core.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from dodging, I felt like he dared to take it all because defending was troublesome.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it seemed there was no damage. It felt like it was meaningless no matter how many attacks landed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so…… it’s a little risky, but… I’ll dive in!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Going in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jump into his pocket. From here, slam my firmly clenched fist at his open jaw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Smash!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A powerful strike-up blow above the opponent’s neck resounded dully… no way……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My smash caught Machio’s jaw. However, Machio’s neck didn’t budge, and I couldn’t swing my fist off either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Machio withstood my smash with just the strength of his neck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A splendid blow…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hitting my body this hard, an average man would break his knuckles… the fact that you are safe is proof that you have been trained intensively.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio praised me while receiving my smash on his chin as if nothing had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, I thought he could take a hit, but… this is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll go too? You will be able to endure it. Arcane True Zenith ―――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lariat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, looking at me in his pocket, Machio made a huge force bump on his arm and swung it around without any tricks to attack me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the attack was so big that I could bend over and avoid it… but the moment the attack passed overhead, my spine froze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if I’d gotten hit in the face with that one?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The glass of the third floor windows cracked, and a huge crack ran through the wall, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How … wha … aat?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phew… Oh, no…… I couldn’t take that into consideration because it’s been a while… after all, I am still immature. I can’t control my own power…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He swung his arm so forcefully, its wind pressure alone destroyed the wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That alone was as dangerous as magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, I was stunned too… even though I was in the middle of a spar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fool! Do not remain vacant!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I got you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the time I realized it, it was too late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was flabbergasted, Machio put both his hands around my torso and held me tight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sh*t, gu, nu, wha, tch”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I try to wriggle my way out, it wouldn’t budge. I couldn’t get it off!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… loosen your back form. Stretch out your hands, but prepare to take the fall.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next thing I knew, both of my feet were floating off the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The scenery turned upside down. Machio arched his back wide and lifted me up overhead… hey, wh, what!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child! Wh, this is… the Lariat mentioned earlier… eh, this one! Jamdi’el, I never! She actually taught this man…!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Tre’ainar was very upset. What is it? What the…? From this position… only one thing comes to mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you lifted me up over your head, then you’ll slam me vigorously…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith, Power Bomb!” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bubohoooo!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””It’s here. Ma, Machio’s Deathly Power Bomb!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Power Bomb!? T, tis unbearable! Child, stand up! Get up, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was slammed on my back, my breathing… no, no good, what’s this? I’ve been punched, kicked, slashed, and hit by magic many times, but it’s the first time I’ve been slammed on my back… my body went numb… what a power move it was!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Tre’ainar… rather than worrying … is he excited?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well … generous young man. Would you like to try another one?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, gah wh, at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking down at me, Machio turned his back to me and moved to the corner of the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought he was going straight out of the ring, but he wasn’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””It’s here! Machio’s Deathly Full Course!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He climbed on top of the pillar standing in the corner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Noo, this most certainly is!? Tis perilous, child! Stand up! On your feet, child! Find your vigor! Cheer up, child! With enough spirit, you can do anything! Show me your burning spirit!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio, who climbed the pillar, looked down at me from a high position as I was lying down. What? No, no way! Eh, he certainly won’t, from there…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, Tre’ainar! What’s wrong with you? No, more than that, Mr. Machio!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, let’s go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, from there… you’re joking, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Machio climbed into the corner! What will he do there? A simple drop kick!? Diving Elbow!? Could it be, flying body slam!? Either way, the child is in a pinch! From here on out, is it Machio’s time!? Tis inevitable!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””” Go, Machio!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle, fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, why Tre’ainar… do you look so happy? Why are you so excited!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “God… in order to brighten up the citizens of the Demon Realm who were scarred by the war and gloomy dark clouds, created a “show to cheer up the people” rather than “fight”… this is a technique and a culture that God loved. Hence, I imparted it to Machio was most predisposed and physically fit for it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was gloating…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Humans will inherit the skills and culture of God… and God, up in the Divine Realm, will be pleased with this new history.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Machio turned his back!? Well, I see! Tis a moonsault!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, God is already pleased at the ring corner, let alone the Divine Realm!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, Tre’ainar, you’re cheering for Machio instead of me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I won’t play along, this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Moonsault!” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dangerous. While Machio was spinning in the air, he dived directly above me. Move…… Move!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… Somehow, I had a lot of time, and my numbness had settled a bit, so…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nooooooooooh!! Tryaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pwah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Forcing my numb body to move, I managed to roll over the ring, avoiding Machio’s dive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Puha~ … missed … Goho, Geho …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio crashed into the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power was enough to shake the entire dojo and to make it seem like he would eventually go through the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, maybe if he did it seriously, the technique now… even more……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whew, you scared the sh*t out of me… I stopped breathing… I’m still on my back …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Although, you can move now? That’s some great resilience.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I’ll never get caught again. What was that useless move you just made? Why are you wasting your time when you could just hit or stomp like normal!? You can usually avoid that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I couldn’t let Machio catch me anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, I complained about why Machio did such antics when he had a great chance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, the destructive power of Machio’s attack was certainly amazing, and although it was a flashy move, the motion was huge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you have the nerve, you can properly avoid it――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Child…… you…… dullard!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? ……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was yelled at by Tre’ainar. Eh? Why? Was I too careless?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You… why did you avoid that attack?』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You should have the spirit to accept and endure it! Are you still my disciple?? Where is the grit you showed when you stopped and exchanged blows with Aka!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s sermon was totally unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was angry that I avoided the attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, why? Why are you angry at me avoiding attacks?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made no sense to me, and I was generally flabbergasted…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… boring.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Boo, so boring.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae, who was watching our sparring under the ring, muttered as if disappointed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, well, that’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come now, I know how it feels.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’d run away too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other guys also expressed their sympathetic opinions, but they all looked as if they were a little let down as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, why? Why am I disappointed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeh, shut up! Or you’re just battering on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I decided to concentrate on this spar without being influenced by selfish and unclear opinions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No left-handed pokes or single smashes will work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, still if I just try out various other things, I move my feet on the ring again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dear me, I was suddenly invited, but …! Him… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Hey, Motriage… Mobner… Budeo…… it’s that guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We met him at school, it’s him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, Machio was too strong to spar with, so when they saw a chance to watch him spar, the people in the dojo got excited and spread the word to the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing the rumors, the people in the town stepped into this place one after another, and before you know it, even the boys of the magic school had rushed there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, it’s my turn next! I’m gearing up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a situation, I enchanted him to the fullest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] [Holy SH!@]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] [What the F@#$]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Are you f@#$ing kidding me? Any sane person would!!!
