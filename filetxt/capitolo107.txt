 Just as I was about to put more strength into my legs so I could move around with more speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stop. Interval.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el rang the bell and stopped us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment he heard it, Mr. Machio turned his back on me and went to the corner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle… water. Water”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah, good girl, Amae. Thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unfu~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae offered a glass of water to Machio when he reached the corner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio patted Amae’s head and took it. Amae gave a delightful smile of satisfaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I see… you mean a break?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufufu, how is it? Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Going to the corner, I felt literally drained, and I clicked my tongue too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then a grinning Tre’ainar was waiting for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「My back hurts. I mean, what is that martial art… did you think that up, too?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You might say so… dynamic techniques using punches, kicks, throws, joints, and even the environment… tis not so much about defeating the opponent, tis more to do with captivating, exciting, and entertaining the crowd.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s not going to be easy! I almost lost consciousness!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I complained to Tre’ainar in my mind, but he still seemed to be enjoying himself as much as ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un. Water”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? Oh, are you giving it to me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… Thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Mufu. Amae… good girl ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Amae trotted up to me from the opposite corner and gave me some water as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they’re going to be fair around here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took it gratefully, drank it, and poured a bit on my head to calm down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Them, my mood having settled down, and I calmly recalled the previous offense and defense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The technique that Mr. Machio performed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the more calmly I think, the more I can’t see the need to properly receive an attack that is so full of openings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, it’s impossible to properly get hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I mean, Tre’ainar! What was that about, I shouldn’t dodge it or something… what are you thinking?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis a good experience, is it not? Besides, he would have held back, by nature those techniques look large, but their power is dispersed…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……… just to Electrify the crowd…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『E, elektify』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What’s more, you were rooting for Machio!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I, I was not…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I stared at him with scornful eyes, Tre’ainar looked the other way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was obviously agitated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw Tre’ainar looking like that, I couldn’t help but chuckle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… was this something you were passionate about?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Nuh-uh…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And… seeing a guy who inherited it… were you overjoyed?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Geez…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked him that, Tre’ainar shut his mouth to think a little. Seemed he had something in-mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I saw only that reaction, and I didn’t ask any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next round, begin!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the end of the interval was announced by Jamdi’el, and the bell rang again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, I got out of the corner…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m good enough for you… I’ll remind you of that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… eh!?!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I naturally said something like a new resolve and jumped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Not what Jamdi’el passed along, but what I inherited from Tre’ainar himself…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here we go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s next?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He must have been surprised by Mr. Machio’s skill…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. He’s going to attack like he did before, using his legs to run around, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I noticed, there were quite a few people around the ring. And some of them, as I noticed earlier, were…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s… what…… What the heck?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Umm, against the strongest warrior, that Machio… is he fighting?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no way, right? That’s… someone about the same age as us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This isn’t scary, is it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even those they were there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are they doing here? Did you skip school? Well, staying seemed awkward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I remembered what I said to them. What did I say to them when I parted?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t just linger there, man up, or something…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Could I throw out such a line, be described as “running around with my feet” and remain silent?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, Mr. Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not willing to take such a stupid attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I won’t dodge those attacks to be deemed as running around with my feet either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll show you, “how to fight with your feet”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Going forward, crossing the center of the ring first, and I reached Mr. Machio who was still approaching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, I firmly clenched my right fist, swung it in motion, and hit him from the start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Full Swing!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A wide swing of my fist. Usually, it’s not so easy to land the hit, but Mr. Machio was still ‘deliberately’ tanking all my attacks rather than being unable to respond to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My fist is buried into his nose. However, Machio took it without even blinking, and his legs and neck did not waver at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me, numbness spread throughout my right arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hard…… But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t move… here’s the next one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Knuckle Arrow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio took a big swing at me who was in his pocket, as if he was throwing a projectile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a punch that made my full swing even bigger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That clenched fist was swung down at me… but…… he can’t hit me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yotto”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……phew… fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m not particularly surprised because I knew Machio wouldn’t hit me, but I avoided Machio’s fist by moving only slightly ‘just barely close enough to graze my head and shoulder’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Machio’s attack did not end there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Horizontal Chop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoi”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Mmm …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, I avoid the attack like a hand sword ‘enough to barely graze my chest’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, after these two evasions, Machio seemed to have noticed something, and his eyebrows twitched a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also. both Jamdi’el and Tre’ainar seem to have noticed what I was doing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, he’s avoiding it again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That, an amateur going against Mr. Machio is just reckless.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only the gallery seemed not to have noticed yet. But from here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon One Two!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu… Nu… Arcane True Zenith Straight Knuckle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoi”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My one-two attack poked Mr. Machio in the face, and he threw a straight punch on the counterattack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bent my upper body… swaying to barely avoid it at the last minute ‘just enough to let him touch my bangs’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooh, but it’s dangerous!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A hairbreadth! He almost hit you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go, Mr. Machio, show us the mighty attack!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, kid, if you’re going to run away, run around bigger! You can see how dangerous it is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The gallery unintentionally let out a gasp at the one hair breadth margin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Machio’s expression had changed now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t miss it! Great Demon One Two!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aiming at the edge of Machio’s fist, I pulled off the one-two again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, there was no damage to Mr. Machio, and he immediately struck back again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Water Surface Kick!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yoi”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A low-flying kick that lowered the hips to strike at my feet. I backed away and avoided the kick ‘just barely grazing my shin’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… Well, Arcane True Zenith Inverted Horizontal Chop! Arcane True Zenith Low Kick!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio’s attacks were getting faster and faster, and he could shoot up and down almost simultaneously. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not Anymore… I won’t let you touch me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Repeat ‘Dare to just barely evade’ at the shortest possible distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it seemed that the gallery had finally begun to notice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Something… weird, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Being so close… why can’t you touch him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Take a look! His… feet movement!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle’s Punch… not hitting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don’t use the entire ring to fight at a great distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dare to fight a super close combat. In the midst of it all, always moving the feet in small increments to evade the opponent’s attacks at high speed at the shortest distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if the attacks of Machio become faster, then my speed will also increase, and if the power of the opponent’s attack increases, I’ll gradually counterattack back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, amazing… so amazing! Wh, what is he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s not… using magic… it’s flesh and blood… how can he do that!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on… I can’t think of any words to describe it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I… It’s like an art-form.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stop and exchange blows fairly? Use the feet to get away? Wrong. I use my feet to exchange blows fair and square.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s my way, which started the day Tre’ainar trained me. And that’s what I inherited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu… what an in and out… and a solid left and right like a blunt instrument…… what is this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can still go fast, Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if there was no damage, Mr. Machio seemed to be surprised with eyes wide open, as expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, will you get a bit serious now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Certainly the footwork is splendid… but…… that’s not what I find impressive. Because, if it is only about simple speed, Karui is faster… therefore…… what is impressive… is he doesn’t make any mistakes. Does thou have no… fear?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Jamdi’el, who was looking at me with sharp eyes, muttered quietly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However big it may be, the damage will not be avoided if it hits even slightly… let alone with the opponent’s superhuman strength… without blinking at the opponent’s attack in the super close combat, daring to evade by the margin of the skin’s depth or a piece of paper… in other words, though the child has a sense of tension against that attack, it does nothing to slow his reaction with fear… while taken aback by the first Lariat being an unknown technique… that is no longer an issue.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the corner, Tre’ainar, who had been huffing a while ago, was muttering with a somewhat warm look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…… such impudence… child… are you showing off? Are you telling me watch you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t look back on the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You have me now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My Goodness… jealous are we… such a cute little fellow.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No I’m not!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi… Do not distract yourself in the middle of a spar, concentrate.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I ran through again, feeling like my back was pushed by Tre’ainar, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now to the right! Get blown away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Smash!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless of my sore fist, I sent a smash, which had no damage on the left, into the lower jaw of Machio on the right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu … tsu …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was as hard as ever, and his knees don’t waver or step back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What kind of body do you have?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My fist, are you okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, it was a smash on the counter with speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think it was pretty good, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… that’s a big one… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Machio who received my smash…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Apparently… the extent of my attacks… you don’t find them scary… or, do you know of even stronger attacks?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, loosened his stance and muttered to himself as he relaxed his entire body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ve probably… fists more destructive than yours… kicks sharper than yours… attacks that are more anomalous and faster than yours… you’ve fought someone who is overwhelmingly stronger than you, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio looked up, stared straight at me, and asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To that question, I naturally remembered the faces of the four.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka’s fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro’s kicks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe’s speed and tricky attacks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was exactly what happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. That’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how fascinating the technique is to watch, I won’t go along with it, and I won’t lose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, I answered Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey… the bell hasn’t been rung yet, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Did you quit?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio suddenly stopped and ended the spar itself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After showing a little thought, he turned to Jamdi’el under the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master. We shouldn’t be doing any more.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A man who moves like this… the only way to catch him is to go all out… but it won’t be sparring anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio offered to suspend the spar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed to be the judgment that things will go beyond a mock battle if we go on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Certainly…… should this go any further… thou might break the dojo… or each other…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth Lagann… is that acceptable?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Hmm~ … well…… if you’re not motivated, then fine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was still warmed up and had a long way to go, I accepted the spar’s suspension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I was convinced that it would go beyond the mock battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That said, this spar is my loss. That was a great move.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Machio refreshingly admitted defeat at this point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ke, what… I’m not happy with this one bit, and I don’t think I won anything. This is coming from someone who hasn’t given it his all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not giving it my all? You didn’t show your trump card either, aren’t you same?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still had the Breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, both Machio and I have seen that we could get a step stronger from here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I understand that it was a mutual thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t feel like I can see Machio’s bottom yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why we didn’t reveal any more of each other’s hands here, and the conclusion is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then … this time …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, in three months we’ll settle things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’ll settle it in the coming days. With that promise, our spar came to an end.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
