<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the end of sparring, I got off the ring while wiping my sweat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it was more like a self-introduction than a sparring session.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because there wasn’t much damage to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pain on my back wasn’t lingering, and my numbness was gradually subsiding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if I’d been hit with all his might, it would not have ended well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even though, he was seriously muscular… is he really human?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, he is human without a doubt.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing Mr. Machio wiping sweat with a hand towel, I thought for a moment, “Just like Bro, Machio is actually also…”, which Tre’ainar denied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He possesses higher limits of physique, skeletal structure, and muscle mass than most humans… In some sense…… tis likely he possesses what is close to the limits of the muscle mass humans can obtain by “purely” training… without being conceited about his gifted talent… I suppose he gained such through my blood-soaked training.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Talent… Is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Talent. Tre’ainar also said that after my Max measurement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how hard I train, I can’t catch up with Machio’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, despite being the same human, those thick muscles are out of the standard, a crystallization of his talent and effort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In three months, that power will be unleashed at full throttle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was both interesting and quite troubling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… A… amazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when I noticed dozens of people around me as I stepped out of the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, everyone was buzzing, as if they had acknowledged me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You were … so … so amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who the hell are you, bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… can you do that… that much?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you a genius, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys from the magic school were surprised and puzzled by me, and had somewhat complicated expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps, because I was seen as someone in the same situation as they were or the fact that I’m “one of many other guys other than José”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, thank you. But there’s still more to go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still more!? Even though he’s so strong… such courage… yet there’s still a long way to go…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Because my goal now is to win the tournament in three months… but that’s not my ultimate goal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. Higher and stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A feat that surpasses my father’s achievement of defeating Tre’ainar… to achieve that, there is no thing as “this is enough” strength to accomplish it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Although they call it my defeat, it was through cowardly means.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even though Tre’ainar was the one whispering me an earful, but still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve sparred with him many times, so I knew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, who still can’t even land a blow on Tre’ainar, my father who defeated him, even if it was through cowardly means, was still ahead of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? That? But, in that sense…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I think thou will do more than I imagined. And I will buy that haughty ambition.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el came over to show her appreciation to me after finishing the spar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. My father and the seven heroes who once saved the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was among the Six Supremacy who can be said to be almost the same level as the Seven Heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I fight her, I’ll have a rough idea of the distance…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cease at once. tis still too soon for “that”…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar, who usually says, “Go, child!”, drew the line at that idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, the difference was still vast…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, hah~, excuse me, could you step aside a little! J, just now, I heard it was a victory, but really, is it true!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sound of running up the stairs vigorously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The voice of a woman raising her voice while gasping for breath.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman appeared scraping through the crowd.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh~, huh~, huh~… Hey? Is it true that Mr. Machio sparred? Besides, it was a great spar… and he’s surely aiming to win the tournament!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as she arrived, she was spouting words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was lightly dressed in a short sleeved top and shorts, held full shopping bags in both hands, and sported a ponytail with her long black hair pulled back into a single bun behind her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She wore a band around her forehead to keep the bangs out of the eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that body… although she was a woman, she was quite well-trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A firmly toned body. It was reminiscent of a Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the only difference from Shinobu is… she had melons for breasts and they were swinging and swaying…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi, are you just returning?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big Sister”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio!? Is it true that you sparred?! Moreover, a good match against Mr. Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh I see… she is Amae and Karui’s… even so, I thought she would be younger because she was those two’s older sister, but she didn’t seem much older than me… about one or two years?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, he was strong. The tournament in three months… it’s like an unexpectedly strong opponent has emerged.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, so much…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s the guy there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The woman named Tsukshi, after being told by Mr. Machio, came to look me over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also gave her a light bow and quick hello.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the woman named Tsukshi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Or he’s… the boy that the High Priestess brought to us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, seems that way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s right… he was strong enough for Mr. Machio to praise him so much. Then, if this is the case, Mr. Machio’s victory in the tournament… it’s becoming tougher~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? You think Machio’s victory might be in a pinch, but why do you look somewhat happy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, both Karui and Jamdi’el were like that… I’m finally getting worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s really going to happen when you win? No way, it shouldn’t be some sort of sacrifice, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Is Tsukshi worried that I might not win the tournament?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? No, no, that’s… no, I don’t think so~… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, ha, but, I myself am getting tensed and motivated with this. I have to work harder to win the tournament in three months’ time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no, uh… Mr. Machio has been working hard enough… but maybe you don’t need to work so hard anymore~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the “good vibes” drifting between the two warmed the atmosphere of the room somewhat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are these two people in “that kind of relationship”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Hello~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m Tsukshi. 17 years old. I’m living in a church like Karui and Amae and I’m here to support your livelihood, so pleased to meet you~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She said and greeted me… 17 years old!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you’re two years older than me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, so, are you 15 years old? Then, if you have any problems, leave it to big sister~♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, b, but”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can call me Big Sis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tsukshi smiled and tapped her chest… surely I’m not the only one who saw those swaying things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, Mr. Mahcio… How old are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Myself? I’m 27 years old, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T, twenty-seven years old!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought he was over 30, but surprisingly… No, still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But Mr. Machio and Tsukshi…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big Sis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Elder Sis Tsukshi…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… Well, maybe a compromise? So what about me and Mr. Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you’re… a couple yet 10 years apart in age…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it may not be uncommon for a couple to have such difference in age, but it’s amazing that a teen is in love with someone ten years older than them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz and I have a four-year age difference… we didn’t go out though! I couldn’t go steady with her like that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?! Eh, eh!? Eh?! Is, is that right? Eh!? Is, is that how it looks like to you!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Elder Sis Tsukshi suddenly blushed bright red and got flustered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? That? Is it different, “not yet”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, no, young man. Like Amae and Karui, Tsukshi has been around since she was very young, she’s like a daughter and a younger sister to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, Elder Sis Tsukshi groaned “Zuun” as she got blatantly depressed with a heavy thump in the air, at the words Mr. Machio said with a refreshing smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the people in the dojo and from the town smiled wryly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, I see. That’s the way it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, Mr. Machio’s line was correct in a sense, but the remark was too cruel… Moreover, the person himself has zero malice. Didn’t you notice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, I didn’t want to be treated as a kid brother by Sadiz, either…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… hmm…… I get it.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ha~, is this how the men of this country are? Do you have hearing loss or are you insensitive to the human mind?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh? What do you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you know about a person’s feelings if you can’t notice the feelings of a woman with such a blatant attitude?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child… are you, of all people, saying that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah? That’s right. I’m not deaf, I’m not insensitive. I’ve heard Shinobu’s confession, and her feelings are painfully apparent, so I’ve been thinking a lot about it too…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Huh…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh, what is it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No… just…… I just felt pity for the girl.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Tre’ainar let out an exasperated sigh of dismay at me, but what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… that…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the boys of the magic school were awkwardly in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I recall, this guy was Mortriage…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you’re going to win the tournament in three months… do you mean you’re going to beat José?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I didn’t care about that man so much… well……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. I’m going to knock them all down… whoever they are.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told him so I could be heard by those around me, and I dared Mr. Machio to hear me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hoh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio also grinned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He firmly accepted my challenge…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. However, I will not lose. There’s a reason I can’t lose.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s right. But I’m not going to lose, either. I have no reason to lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somewhat refreshingly, but our sparks were properly flying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The people around me started making a lot of fuss, and Elder Sis Tsukshi was muttering things like “I have hope…”. Yes, let’s find out what happens if we really go for the win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I have a request! Of you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage that seemed to have decided something to do with me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With you… can I train too? I also…… I want to be stronger!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was asked to do something that didn’t make sense, but I refused, and I decided to restart my training for the next three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, Ora, wait a minute! I’ll ask you to! Me too… I was struck in the heart by your bravery to fight with the strongest Machio! I’m asking! Let me train with you, too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Me as well…… I want to change myself! I want to be confident in myself!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please! We can’t end it like this! We’re also… frustrated! We’re also human!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, for the time being, let’s do some muscle training.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
