 『Hold the dumb-bell between the big toe and long toe of your foot and lift.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do I train my arms? Do I train my legs? My menu, as I was wondering what I would do, was my toes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? I was motivated to do the normal bench press?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Today, you have done Max Measurements, Magical Parkour, Magical Jumping Ropes, and even sparring. Bench presses and squats would be counterproductive at this point. Today, I shall teach you a few things as you train.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I certainly moved my entire body quite a bit today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood Tre’ainar’s suggestion that doing muscle training in this situation would only be tiring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why the toes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, yours is a fighting style that uses your feet like earlier. However, the characteristics of the foot which is also your weapon… tis not simply ‘foot speed’ that disrupts the opponent’s reaction with sharp steps and feints, tis ‘the strength and speed of the turn’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not sure I get it. Foot speed? Turn? What’s the difference?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Foot speed is basically linear speed. But how many linear dashes do you use in actual battle? Perhaps for slow opponents like Aka or Machio, but it would be difficult to jump into the pocket with a simple straight dash against speedier opponents like Bro or Toulowe, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That is… I guess so…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, when I tried to toss my opponent at speed in a fight, I had the image of taking steps rather than running.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Therefore, the big toe is paramount. Grab the ground with your big toe, store it up and jump in one go… for stop-and-go and left and right weight transfer, the toes… especially your big toe is important. In other words, if you train them, each movement will become even faster. And tis not only about the feet, but also the punches.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? …… No, I understand that toes are important in steps and footwork, but… also for punching?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. As I mentioned, if the toes are well trained, they can smoothly shift your weight back and forth and from side to side, so you can maintain a good balance and release a hard hit from any posture, and when you step in by kicking the ground hard, the force is firmly planted on the big toe, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Certainly…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You have already done so to some extent without being told. But from now on, put more effort into your big toes, train them, and be conscious of them.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see… so I should put a dumbbell between my toes and train…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what has he been doing in front of the mirror?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t he hold the dumbbells?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s thinking about it, but doesn’t know how to use it, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oops. So much for the conversation in my mind, it’s about time I got started.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「With my toes… I wonder if I can?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This should be a daily routine. When there are no dumbbells, you can substitute an empty wine bottle instead. Always have the image of ‘grasping hard’ with your toes.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dumbbells in front of the mirror.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stretch out my arms and stand on one leg, straighten my spine in front of the mirror and lift the dumbbell at my feet between my big toe and long toe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, Uo, Gu, Nu, Yu, toes, eh, t, tearing … Gu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not simply carry it. Hold it and raise your knee at a right angle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fugu, nu, gu, nu …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My toes were about to come off! The thought crosses my mind that I might dislocate it if I’m a little bit careless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from the perspective of others, this looks like a pretty weird workout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh come on, doesn’t he know how to use dumbbells?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s sort of amazing though.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shouldn’t somebody teach him if that’s the case?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But he was saying something about doing it in his own way… or, that’s amazing despite how it looks…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could hear giggles and ridicule from around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Amae… is it true, did he have a good match against Mr. Machio~…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un. It was a little… cool…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ugh … my wish … please … please …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although there was no sign of flirtation at first glance, Elder Sis Tsukshi seemed to wish for my victory instead of Mr. Machio. She had a mysterious attitude of “I’d rather you didn’t win because I like you, Mr. Machio”, so I’m worried about the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly it’s embarrassing to think that you’re using it wrong, but… I’ll find out what happens if I win…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Good start. Tis not the wrong way to use it, but a different way to use it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, i, is that any different?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis very different. In the first place, there is nothing wrong in doing things the right way. But if you only do it the right way, will you ever get to the top?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Th, that’s…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The answer is no. Only a handful of people can stand on top. Tis also limited to those who have talent superior to others, such as Machio. Therefore, the untalented person can merely approach the top but not exceed the top by only doing things the right way.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While listening to words of Tre’ainar beside me that I shouldn’t worry about the eyes around me, I chuckled, thinking, “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in short, it’s not enough to do the same thing as others, so I kept on going.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For this reason… not within other people… look at yourself… for you desire to change of yourself… so it appears.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard Tre’ainar’s words with a slight grin, I turned back a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, this is tough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooh, w, will we get stronger with this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ca, can’t even hold it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wish it was lighter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boys of the magic school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They said they wanted to train with me, but I didn’t have time for them and I was too busy with myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I declined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next thing I knew, those guys were behind me, doing the same thing I did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Hey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…… Hmm?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first I wanted to ignore it, and then I thought they could do whatever they wanted, but… no good…… I’d feel bothered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The thing is… I’m just doing it the way that suits me… it doesn’t mean you’ll be any stronger if you do the same thing, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So even if it makes sense for me, it may not make sense for them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why don’t you ask the High Priestess or another instructor? This is a dojo, and even if you’re a student of the magic school, they’ll teach you properly, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They want to train with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what they said, but I told them to ask the dojo guys for guidance rather than do training that may or may not make sense to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But these guys…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… that may be right… I agree, too. But…… it’s just a gut feeling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… you know, to us… that Mr. Machio, and… even that Yosei, you may be a man who knows a world we all don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage’s words… were correct in a sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For those who have spent all their time in a secluded nation, I’m from the outside world, and I’m different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… if we’re chasing your back, we might be able to see a different view of the world… if we see that world… maybe even more… we could change… that’s what I thought.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being…… I think I’m being praised. But I didn’t think they’d be rewarded just by chasing me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…… I see… if so…… you might as well ‘take advantage’ of it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar muttered beside me as I was wondering what to do…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child. I believe this is also training… why not try it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why not try training with these ones for a bit?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Why?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
