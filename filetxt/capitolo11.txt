<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a certain room, the Emperor and the Prime Imperial Warrior, who are considered the pinnacle of all the warriors of the Empire, were having tea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, the relationship is as between a Lord and his subordinate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there was no such mood between them, as the air was filled with the laughter of old friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah so, the other day… Earth got pissed at me… it’s kinda tough… at that age.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Talking about issues that could be found in any common family, is the man who stands at the head of the imperial warriors and holds the title of Hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hiro Lagann.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was one of the seven Heroes of the world, and the man that dealt the final blow to defeat the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goodness sake, to think you became the Warrior Prime, you’ve ways to go… is what I’d like to say, but I’m the same. In both good and bad ways, there are difficulties when it comes to Phianse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Giving Hiro his answer with a wry smile is the Emperor who reigns over the empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Solja Depaltia.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is also one of the world’s proud ‘Seven Heroes’, and was at Hiro’s side when they stood up to the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Hiro is a young figure that looks like a man in his twenties even though he is in his thirties, this man is in his thirties, but he looks so good one would assume he’s in his late teens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With long shiny golden hair bundled at the back of his head, and androgynous yet handsome features caught halfway between a little boy and a young man who still retains a little innocence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But young Phianse is naturally full of talent. In that respect, Earth isn’t as good, I wish he would breakthrough that wall already.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is not as stupid as you are… his situation would be hard to get through I suppose. However, in the future, such qualities might be beneficial.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so? Me, I’m like a jack of all trades, but… he can do much better… am I an overly doting parent for thinking so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course not. With me… and…… I strong think that way about Phianse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, but… when compared to Miss Phianse, and even ‘Rebal’ and ‘Fu’ who are studying abroad…” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Emperor and the Chief of Imperial Warriors. However, when not in a public place, the conversation between these two would be of parents concerned about the growth of their children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And so, what about that story? That…… ah… after Miss Phianse and Earth’s graduation from the Academy… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… as Phianse’s fiancé…… you mean that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. You see…… Long ago, we were drunk and made a joke… Phianse happened to be listening and took it seriously, but at the time, I passed it off as the fancy dreams of a cute kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, with a little embarrassment, Hiro talked to Solja about the future of their children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to the question, Solja smiled bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, Phianse is serious even after turning fifteen… I mean, with the graduation approaching and coming to check with me many times, she wants to announce it in upcoming games.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously…? How are you～. Earth hasn’t been told yet, but… you fine with this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay. Rather, I would be happy if it would be so. Our children bound together, and everyone being in the family… I believe it would be wonderful… After that, their love for one another… It would be so moving to everyone around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dahahaha, but if you say so, I’d be thrilled, but… it’s just, the guy… to be honest, he’s fallen for Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What about Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… that girl, [If Little man becomes aware of the princess’s feelings and seriously considers it, yet still chooses me… we may runaway together ♡] she said… with that vicious smile of hers.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T-That’s a problem…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, to be honest, I don’t know how serious Sadiz is… also, she’s pretty twisted.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such was the discussion among adults that Earth himself was unaware of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a scene of two men who talked about a peaceful and happy future while holding their heads in worry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excuse me. Oh… Your Majesty…… Warrior Prime. I say. I’m surprised you came all the way to the Academy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Instructor!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the person who suddenly entered the room, the two called out, not with the expressions of parents worried about raising their children, but with child-like smiles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please stop, instructor. If a teacher calls me ‘Warrior Prime’, it might drive me mad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We are the only ones here now, so please don’t call me ‘Your Majesty’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, this is all just~, well, if it’s not in public, it’s still… So, after this are you two…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. The principal and I are discussing the establishment of a new school building to become a sister institute.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This project will also strengthen our connection with other countries, so I would like to cooperate fully.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Those two… really, they’ve become amazing people.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That person was their teacher when they were students at the Academy, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, sir. Are you teaching our children in one of the subjects now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How’s it going? Our kids.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, we just finished a lecture in our classroom. And…… it’s about those two…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now he teaches their two children, Earth, and Phianse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man who became the instructor for two generations of parents and children has a serious look on his face towards the parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First of all, Phianse seems to resemble the old Solja. She is worthy of the moniker “godchild”, and puts in the effort without being arrogant about her blessed talent. She garners a lot of trust from her classmates, and will definitely lead the empire well in the future. However, it’s unfortunate that there are times when she’s a little confused and doesn’t regard her surroundings, also sometimes she’s pretty stubborn.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Earth is also excellent. There is no doubt about it. His efforts are decent. But everyone, including me, builds up the hero, Hiro to him. It’s become a burden, and I’m concerned that lately I’ve been seeing a little bit of rebellious behavior.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Being told the current situation of the two, Solja and Hiro nodded their head in response to the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the exact impression that they had recently felt of their own children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having heard from a third party about their issues and concerns, they both came to think that they had to do something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, ultimately Phianse is fine. Well, the recent problem is Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Instructor?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Main point, Earth tried to answer my question by saying something cheeky. That’s why I made him take supplementary lessons afterwards!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yeah, hahaha. I was made to take a lot supplementary lessons by my teacher. Good times…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That it is. Well, it’ll be time soon. I’ll see you two later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor lightly grumbles about the errands he has after this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as he was leaving the room, he suddenly remembered…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yes, Earth did say something peculiar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 About the previous class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “[What was the magic eye of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar?] to that question his response was ‘Six-Gate Eyes’ or something. Seriously, that boy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eh!!!???””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, I’ll be going now. If you’re free, do give a little encouragement to the other students.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Ah, s-sure, sir!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor took his leave after their discussion, but the content was too shocking, thus both Hiro and Solja were petrified and could not move for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, after a few seconds of silence, they open their mouths, their lips trembling as they look at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… H-Hey… Hiro… N, now…… what did the instructor just say? What was Earth’s answer?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Si…… Six-Gate eye……was it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… D-Did you tell him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dumbass! I don’t need to be reminded! But only we Seven Heroes know about it. Why…… does Earth know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… It’s better to conceal the existence of such horrible eyes. That’s why we agreed, just us who were there to keep it a secret.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Who was it? Who revealed something weird to Earth? Oh no…… did I say it while wasted?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the father and the child never took the time to face each other … the fact that he has not seen his son often enough … The path that the father wants his son to follow is gradually shifting.
</div>

 [S1] Again with this. The name here is literally ‘Rival’. So I’m guessing this will be the MCs foil. Wasn’t sure how to edit it but a Google search of names relating to rival came up with ‘Rebal’, so I’m going with it. Fu I think is fine as is.
