 “Jeez!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This wasn’t a joke, I objected to Tre’ainar in my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to thoroughly train for the next three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hence, I want to focus on just that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have time to take care of anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I do not mean constant supervision, nor am I saying to mirthfully link hands in a row with everyone. I simply ask if you would toil together.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So why! I mean, it’s not that I don’t sympathize with these guys after hearing their story… even so, why for these guys… in a row?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not simply for their sake. I believe it will all be to your benefit as well… Never mind the rows…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t understand what Tre’ainar was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would it be good for me to train with them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… what are the benefits of rigorously training with others?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? …… with other people… let’s see… to compete… right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu, well, tis a fair point, but… the benefits of training with others is… ‘incentive’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Incentive. The first thing that came to mind when I heard that was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Incentive…? So, you mean to compete and encourage each other? With these guys? But their abilities might be…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even without competing, they may incentivize you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you don’t compete, it can be incentivizing… I didn’t really get it, and when I tilted my head, Mortriage tilted his head to me as I silently stood there for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey? What’s wrong? That…… are you so opposed to it that you’re left speechless?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, Ora, we’re begging you, please. We… we won’t get in the way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oops, what should I do… I haven’t even finished talking about it yet…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Anyway, do some Magical Roadwork. I shall teach while you run.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… jeez… fiiiine…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, I decided to follow his suggestion since he said he would teach me while I ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I’d rather run alone, but…well…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go for a run “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…………””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You may as well follow me, if you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh!? Let’s go!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it seemed that they would really follow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, can these guys even keep up with me…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Next to dumbbells, those are Magical Power Ankles and Magical Power Wrists. Equip them on yourself as a handicap.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a handicap to account for it. I was forced to put weights on my wrists and ankles… I mean… Heavy!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you want us to put those weights on too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you guys don’t have to! Actually, listen? Don’t you put it on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, there was no point in you equipping them as well if my intention was to give a handicap.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, you running?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was about to go out with the weights wrapped around my wrists and ankles, Amae came running up to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I guess so…… well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Un”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I answered, Amae nodded and for some reason reached her hands out to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t sure what that meant, but when a young child does this it’s like asking for a hug…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way… y, you too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un. Let’s go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… wh, at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Piggyback”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seemed she enjoyed the first Magical Parkour so much that she insisted on me giving a piggyback again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, oh, I’m training…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go. Piggyback!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it’s Roadwork, so… I need to use both hands while running for shadows and stuff! That’s why I can’t piggyback!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu uh! Piggyback!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not a joke. Even just taking Mortriage’s group, and even with my arms and legs weighted down, from there it would be too hard to also give a little girl a piggyback ride.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Amae’s sentiments would not give up,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mu~ ~ ~ ~, piggyback!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With her cheek puffing, she grabbed my clothes and resisted, refusing to let go until I nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uwa~, t, too cute. Kofu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Budeo… be quiet… the moment you said that out loud, even we thought you seemed like a criminal. Have some self-awareness.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at Amae’s behavior next to me, Budeo and Mobner were having a slightly deplorable exchange, but I’ll not put a retort in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, the problem is this kid…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! Amae, don’t you bother him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at that time, Elder Sis Tsukshi rushed over, and scolded Amae for acting selfishly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother has to train now. You’re being unreasonable while he’s doing his best, anyway… or he’s working hard to win the tournament and fulfill his promise to Mr. Machio, so don’t be a nuisance, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No buts~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was exactly what an older sister scolding a younger sister looked like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Amae turned away in a sudden bad mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No! I want piggyback.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll give you a piggyback ride later!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… no…… I like him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae gradually grew timid and despondent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, I felt a little sorry for her… No, no, but, I’m training… wait, she likes who?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come now, Tsukshi… it looks like Amae got a brother, so she’s happy, right? You don’t have to be so angry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Machio came up to appease the Tsukshi, but Tsukshi wouldn’t give up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio, with Amae… incidentally, I heard from Karui that you always pamper her too much!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, I don’t think she should interfere with his training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s true, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Machio was also defeated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, rather than an older sister, she’s more like a mature lady scolding a father for spoiling his selfish daughter…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Get married””””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, when the voices of me and Mortriage’s group overlapped as we muttered loudly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae, I’ll take you on my shoulders.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. Uncle, slow.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu… uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With him, feuuuuw~, then whish whosh, and bonce jump, then go round and round and like zig zag! It’s fun! I like him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even though Mr. Machio was being considerate, the selfish girl wouldn’t listen, and finally clung to my leg… Hey, when did we get along this far?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… My oh my…… are you not popular, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No. Although, when I was in the Empire, I was so unwelcome, but lately I’m doing well… is this my popular phase?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『………………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… never mind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was hiding a lot this morning, but I just gave her a little piggyback and she’s attached to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, they say children are truly simple-minded, well… but still, I can’t bring her with…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It cannot be helped. Take her along, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… what? Hey, what are you… well, as I said earlier, I don’t have time for this!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You may consider her the same as a weight, like on your wrist.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, no, still if I give a piggyback, I my hands won’t be free during roadwork, so shadows…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If so―――――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar gave a suggestion. And, Tsukshi pulled Amae, who clung tightly to my leg, and trying not to leave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae! Will you listen to what I say!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Noo! Wooont!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s already getting a little more troublesome.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I want to put an end to the conflict…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Er, Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un? Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I picked up Amae who was being pulled by Tsukshi, lifted her up, and placed her… on my shoulder…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t give a piggyback because I need to use both hands, but is this okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s a shoulder ride.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… hold on, you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if I can’t use both hands while giving a piggyback, I can give a shoulder ride. With Tre’ainar’s proposal, Machio smiled at a surprised Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fah… ah… so high…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Then you want to get off?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uun un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When she heard that, Amae, who was on my shoulders, panicked and threw her hands around my head and hugged me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can use both hands like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I was also going to have you try something like this as you train with them. While maintaining a firm axis and balance so as not to drop the one you are carrying, run with firm legs and waist… this will strengthen your core. As I explained earlier with the toes, be conscious and train them.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I’m going to do some Roadwork with weights on my hands and feet and shoulders… Huh? I was told today would be light, but isn’t this pretty hard?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you… i, is it okay~…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Because it can’t be helped…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, I’m really sorry… oh, but as an apology, how about Big Sis splurges on whatever you want for dinner tonight~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tsukshi said to me with an apologetic expression, as she looked at Amae going “Mufu~♪” on my head, and sighs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good for you, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, Mr. Macho gave a tender smile to that Amae, such a straight dad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, then, let’s go! Magical Roadwork!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so, much to my annoyance, I set out on my roadwork with four guys and a little girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking about it, it’s the first time I’ve done this with anyone other than Tre’ainar… at the Academy, we get paired up with others in the curriculum… well, I only ever paired up with the princess… she always said annoying things like, “I’ll sacrifice myself because it can’t be helped”. They better not try that stuff with me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it doesn’t matter, at least it’s the first time I’ve taken the lead and run with someone like this… not since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a kid… let’s see…… at that time, I didn’t have a complex with everyone yet… I didn’t think of the princess as a thorn in my side… and I didn’t doubt that Rebal… and Fu … were my lifelong friends, but…
</div>
