<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just putting weights on both hands and feet felt different from usual. In addition, with a little girl placed on my shoulder, it’s on a whole other level.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, there wouldn’t be a problem carrying a child as small as Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, I didn’t have much of a problem when I first started my roadwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I soon felt the weight. Furthermore……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooh~. More, weee, take it! So gooood.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, Nuh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As she rode my shoulder, the balance shifted randomly, like when she hit my head, pulled at my hair, and tilted her weight back and forth, side to side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s pretty difficult to run while trying not to drop her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Balance and legs. Certainly this may be a good workout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuu, ha, fuu, amazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah. He’s wearing so much, has a kid on his shoulder and still running ahead of us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even though I had a handicap, these guys were still following behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was from this point that they will get shaken off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Come on, dash! 30 seconds!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After a short distance outside the city, the road opened to reach a sandy beach outside the island.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sandy beach, which stretched on forever, I could see the beautiful scenery with no trash and the endless ocean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t see any other islands on the sea, and the moment I felt deeply moved by this island that was truly an isolated island nation, Tre’ainar gave me instructions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right, dash 30 seconds!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also raise my voice to convey it to the guys behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I can’t worry about them indefinitely. I have to do things my way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, we’re sprinting from here!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraaaa! You’re going to lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi, ha, hi, ha.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, it’s hard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dash for 30 seconds. A run on the sandy beach. My feet get sunk so I can’t step in as powerfully as usual!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is tough for me too… exactly, the toes like he mentioned earlier…the ‘Big toe’ was being trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Right, stop! Ten second interval for shadows.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, shadow… Imagine a virtual enemy on the spot and punch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pu, punch? Like this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, Ora! Ora, Ora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, it’s fast… I can’t see his hands, it’s beautiful…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ze, ha, ze, ou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ten seconds have passed! Dash!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dash!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eh, a, already!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the weights, I work on my legs, feet and balance, and then work out my big toe on the sandy beach… this works… if you do it every day, you’ll get quite a workout… that said, I’m finding it demanding to this extent, so the other guys…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, ha, ha… ts…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage still followed, although he spoke less.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though he has a normal physique, his motor nerves were good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He felt like an honor student who has been raised in a good environment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as shadow is concerned, he punches very carefully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like he’s performing the basics in the martial art I was taught at school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, can’t lose! Urah, Urah, Oraaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oratski was still quite loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because he wore out so soon, he probably doesn’t have that much endurance, but he kept up with me through sheer guts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His physique is quite good, and he seemed to have some power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s not serious at school, but felt like a battle junkie rascal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as shadow is concerned, his punches were crude with big swings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if the form is improved a little, he’ll be pretty good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hii, haa, hii …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mobner was lagging behind the other two, but still trying to keep up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speed, strength, physique, power, it’s all normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, he’s normal… yes, that’s it, normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoeeeee, e, enough, can’t, hard, u, uoeeeeee”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He couldn’t keep up with them from the start, and was spraying out of his mouth to the ocean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was out of the question in many ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The bulkiest of the four.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that doesn’t mean he’s powerful, he’s just obese, Budeo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… Tre’ainar… now, where’s the incentive?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it’s only the first day, wouldn’t he be screened out with this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, then I can focus on myself…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, Budeo, let’s go for it. He’s wearing such heavy stuff, so it’ll be embarrassing if we can’t keep up with this much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, but, I’m, follow, u, ugh, h, hard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But we’re going to change, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, Budeo stopped and looked down on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mobner also rushed up and called out, but he couldn’t move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Budeo, don’t stop! If we don’t work hard here and now, we’ll stay the same forever!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora! Budeo! All right, this is it! Show some guts!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage and Oratski frantically appealed to him, but Budeo shook his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no good, no no, utterly useless! After all… I’ve been a loser since I was born! Just existing, I’m uncool, unpleasant, and girls see me as garbage… no one likes me, no one expects anything from me… as guys like José who are born with talent get fawned over, you can only watch, hii, t, that’s, a, all you can do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, he stopped and started crying…… no…… it’s been awhile since he started… what should I do? Am I going to leave him now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey! Crying won’t help you do anything about it! So, bring out those feelings as you look back at that bastard and those bitches!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I’ll try calling out too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if he doesn’t stand up with this, I’ll really……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Budeo… fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps because everyone was calling out, or maybe that’s the way it was going, Amae also cheered Budeo from on top of my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thereupon, was that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Amae…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, fight on. go go you can do it, Budeo~, Fight OONN”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Oh, li, little Amae, ch, cheering m, me, f, for you… O, OOOOOOOOHH.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His eyes, which had been crying, were wide open, and his mouth, which had only spat out the sounds of whining and weakness, was strongly tightened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whipping both feet, Budeo stood up and stared forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooooo, I’m burning, I’m fired up, Burn these tears awaaaaaaaaaayyy! An angel cheered me on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Budeo dashed with absurd power as if from the scene of a fire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had already forgotten the seconds for the shadow and the dash, and just dashed anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Budeo, you’re fast “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A girl…… perhaps empowered by her cheering, Budeo started running.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahaha… All right, we can’t lose too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, it’s us! It’s us after all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, wait! Me too…… me too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if the dropout showed his guts and tried to go beyond his limit, they must have felt something too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, everyone, fight on too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Got it!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage and others also seemed to have found their voice and energy, saying “We can still do it”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, not just Budeo… I’m happy with this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I didn’t think there were people in the world that would support us anymore…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… I’m glad… somehow, my power is blazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it was a young child, there was someone to genuinely “support” them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re happy with that alone… and felt empowered… somehow, that feeling… I felt like I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jeez… such simple guys…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. Tis no different than when you put great efforts for the sake of your maid’s bosom…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was dumbfounded, Tre’ainar smiled at me and threw a retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The motives for your efforts are impure. Rather, the reason is simple. The more honest people are… the more dedicated… do you remember me saying that shortly after we met?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dedication …?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. In the first place, do you intend to climb high enough just to look down on others?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m training as Tre’ainar told me to, and I’m not thinking of slacking off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I certainly don’t snort like that, I’ve only been doing what I’ve been told lately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, there are people in this country who have more power than me, who are faster than me, and who are more talented than me… alright!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! It’s hard! Train and train… Imagine yourself looking back at both that bastard and the bitch saying, ‘Have a look at this, you bastard?’ Then, you’ll still be able to run!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ouh!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahaha, well, the simplest one here is you… child…… but if intend to be a big man eventually… not simply one person, you would have to also attract the people around you, lead others, and sometimes even inspire others…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a burden is bothersome. If it doesn’t work out, I will leave them behind. I should have thought that way, but I was gradually speaking up more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now… there is no issue with training. The policy has also been decided. However, if you can spend three months on special training… ultimately, I would like something that can dramatically improve your level…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While looking at us running, Tre’ainar folded his arms as if he was considering something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…should I have you learn ‘giga-class magic’… or perhaps ‘summoning magic’… no, but what do you contract with… naturally ‘The Dragon King of Purgatory’ would be too heavy a burden… no, in the first place, the magic power capacity of the child is …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then after closing his eyes once, he opened them again as if he had come to a decision…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, first of all… tis ‘magic breath’… to enable longer breakthroughs…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed something was decided before I knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, to get reference material for the novel, I’ve been reading boxing manga and anime about a certain fishing boat owner’s son, and I spent August crying when I saw the story of a ghost with a childhood friend in summer… The month is over … September is coming soon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I realized…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today was my Birthday… (2019/08/27)
