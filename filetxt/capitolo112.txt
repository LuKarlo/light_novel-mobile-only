<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My calf was bursting. My thighs are tired too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the first day, I guess I was too enthusiastic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~… I had a good sweat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took off my shirt, wiped my sweat while exposing my upper body, and when I looked back, I saw many dead bodies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, ze, ze, ze, l, like this…it’s the first time I’ve run like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, ora, but we’ve done it, come on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… I’m gonna die.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu~un…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of them were lying on the sandy beach, either face down or on their backs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mobner and Budeo seemed to have lost their voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, one thing or another, somehow they ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t suddenly stop and lie down. We need to cool down slowly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m so exhausted that I can’t even exercise to cool down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, my Goodness… is the child acting like a teacher?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, my knowledge was secondhand from Tre’ainar, so if you point it out, it makes me feel uncomfortable, so ignore it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, water, here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Amae, who had gotten off my shoulder during the break, dragged a bucket of water she must have drawn from somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the four dead guys saw it, they flew at the bucket with their eyes shining, and they all passed it around and drank it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Puaaaahhh, I, I’ve come back to life!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora… Hah, hah… Wow! I’ve never felt water so good in my life…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m crying… Somehow, tears are falling…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buhii, kofu, gogu… uh, Amae is a really good girl.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sweetness of water at the end of the training. I understand. I know that feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right… Un…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Amae, with a “smug” expression, puffed up with pride at me. Then she stretched out on her toes a little, and presented her head to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is only one way to handle this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thanks. You’re so good, admirable.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mufuu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I praised and patted her. And, it seemed to be the right choice, Amae laughed with satisfaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I thought about the future while letting the water of life permeate all over my body and feeling a revival.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you guys… just listen up, I want to ask you something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The four guys drinking water, adjusted their breaths, and rested their bodies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’ve been following me for some time now, and I somewhat accepted it and let them do as they like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, now that I’ve got that out of the way, I have to figure out what to do in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys, I understand you want to train because you want to change… but as I said earlier, if you’re training the same as me, you should also identify your own individual traits, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you are influenced by someone and try to imitate them, it may not suit you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I admired my father, chased after him, and picked up a magic sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I met Tre’ainar and he decided to guide me, it led to something that better suited me, and I realized that I had become stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you guys good at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My goodness… attempting to get people to match what suits their personality… tis like just someone else’s coaching policy… let me see, who could it be?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not like I’m going to teach them. I’m just listening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of that, it’s these guys who think about what to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So listen. What suits your personality?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when they heard it, these guys had indescribable expressions, thought, and respectively gave answers which they were confident with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… had pride in my attack magic… before, but not as good as José…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… help out at home chopping wood… an axe… but before José’s power…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not satisfactory at anything, I’m not… like José who’s good at everything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can eat as much sweets as I want… although I’ve never eaten the homemade treats from the school girls that José always eats.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When it came to this, I thought that it had nothing to do with my training and almost put it into words, but I held back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not so demonic as to say, “Well, all of today’s content is meaningless to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaah… what should I do…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe, can I help you anymore?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While scratching my head, I looked at the ocean in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking about it, it’s been a long time since I came to the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so absorbed in training, but when I took a break and looked at it… I wondered…… my body was already covered in sweat and sand… so, without worrying about anything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… hmm~ … right! Uorryaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ah…””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dove straight into the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The water was salty, it got in my eyes, but it was cold, and I didn’t care about the details, so I wanted to be refreshed for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tahahaha… to the sea…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mortriage and the others who were a little surprised at my sudden action…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… hahaha …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All four of them took off their sweaty tops and jumped into the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, it feels good… I didn’t know… the water is so delicious… the sea feels so good…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora! Dahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~…… I could come here at any time… I feel like I haven’t been in the sea for a long time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Puha, m, me, now that you mentioned it, I couldn’t swim when I was a kid, and since then I’ve been in the ocean … oh … I’m floating …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The cold water splashed up and I realized that my worries were gone… it was refreshing… I had fun.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I decided to think a little bit about it and not rush to answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… just now… I’m sorry for the question… unexpectedly…… I didn’t know… about myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What I thought I was good at, I didn’t really have the talent for… thinking about it, I was really talented in a field I hadn’t even thought of… I didn’t really know about myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing the guys who had smiling expressions on their exhausted faces, I got a little shy, but carried on my little narration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I just asked them what they’re good at, but I don’t know if what they think they’re good at in the first place was really their talent or personality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys… when we get back to the dojo, I’ll spar you a little bit. I’ll take a look at you in my way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I was good at magic swords, but Tre’ainar told me otherwise…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I don’t know if that’s really going to go beyond that insensitive deaf bastard… well, if you’re going to do your best, I’ll see what I can do…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh! So, please do!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, in fact, you have to look directly at it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you okay with that? Before I heard that, the four nodded happily, and, well, I decided to go out with them a little more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, did you not say it would be troublesome or you had your hands full with yourself?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Shut it. Things just ended up this way… besides…… well …… these guys, they’re clinging somewhat to the thought of changing… I’m sure you’ll be able to understand why…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I naturally responded to Tre’ainar’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, somehow I understood how they felt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt that the way they were rotting because they were troubled by the wall called José overlapped with the complex feelings I once had for the princess, Rebal and Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「They’re doing their best… I can’t ignore that…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… is that so』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whether he thought I was “Overly optimistic” or not, Tre’ainar, a little taken aback, laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! Unsho! Unsho!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And maybe she was envious after seeing us in the ocean, Amae also had a one-piece sister outfit…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Don’t do that!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unhoh~! Amae was taking it off!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before she takes off her clothes, we all together… except for one person, stopped Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, I’m sure that one of the girls was already right in her assessment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, a lady shouldn’t undress.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……? …… Only Amae… left out?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No, I didn’t …… mean that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Mu~…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The men alone took off their tops, jumped into the sea, and made a pleasant splash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Could a child stay silent when they see it? No, no.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from jumping in, she was not allowed to undress.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be reasonable for her to get sulky, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, next time. Bring your bathing suit next time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… next time? When? Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, soon. I mean, the sea is so close.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Promise? For sure? It’s not a lie?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh, yeah yeah, I promise I promise.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can we all come together? Big sister, Uncle, Karui, High Priestess and Goddess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, come on, I get it I get it, I promise… tsu, Jam… High Priestess? Hmm? Goddess…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was very careful not to make her cry, and I honestly thought it was troublesome, but I casually made a promise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then she managed to endure it, and her cheeks puffed a little, and she said ‘Muh~’, but she didn’t cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufufu』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… what…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar, who had been watching the whole thing without saying much, started giggling
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This girl, and these fellows… the child seems good at taking care of them, regardless of what was said. Well, I believe tis why you can make yourself understood by Ogres and Hoodlums…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu…… what…… are you complimenting me …」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I do not speak ill of you. Besides, in my training plan, I was thinking not only to train with others, but also have the child gain experience in teaching others… to learn what a leader could learn.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? Is that right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well. So you ought to give it a try.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, but I just thought I’d look at them in my way, not give some guidance… as far as leading them… and what if my method is wrong…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Worry not. I shall give counsel as needed. Do not think I would let the child suddenly do everything from start to finish, so be at ease.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar laughs at me like “I’m good at taking care of you”, but I’m going to do my best in my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You’re the one who takes care of me the most!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, if I really look after them, then I must have taken after my master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, he silently faced the other way, feeling embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I am not embarrassed!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would like to thank all of you for your “Congratulations”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the first time so many people have said congratulations on my birthday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m glad I was born!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I noticed, I had 3,000 impressions… No, there were 3000 impacts! From now on, the impression is called impact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the first time that I have had an impact on a single novel so far, and I am deeply moved by various emotions as well as drills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, I was born in 1986. Recently, I became a fairly ossan, since it is already easy to say “Eh!? Showa?” but I think that an ossan is a kid who has a little bit of common sense and has a little more hair, and even now I still read what a boy does every week, and my heart is that of a boy. I will continue to do my best, so I’d be happy if you could get along with me.
