<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way back from the sea. Five half-naked, soaking wet men and a young girl walking through the middle of the town must be quite a strange sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I am already “accustomed” to the stares of the people around me, such as “dismay” and “ridicule”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it didn’t bother me when the people in the town were looking at us and whispering to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sparring… mock battle… I’m nervous…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, don’t freak out, we’ll do it too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… I don’t want you to get too serious…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sudden mock battles are scary! Man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, surprisingly, they didn’t seem to be ashamed, not even uncomfortable with the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe these guys were “accustomed” to a lot… I thought…… however, that was not the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s do it! A swimsuit battle with a date with José on the line! Look at my, bi, bikini!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That swimsuit looks awfully weak, Chiyo. As expected, I’m the one here with the goods…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, that’s it. The time has come, for sexy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’m not going to lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, su, such an unscrupulous match… but I won’t yield!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the shoulder of the guys shook greatly when they heard the girls’ voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked back at the familiar voices, I saw that it was… uh … uh … yeah, I forgot their names already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Five girls were making poses in front of a crowd of onlookers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, way to go, ladies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s already a specialty event in this town… the battle for José, the Wizarding School’s strongest.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A great battle of the maidens.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But main star, José, on the whole…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The townspeople also gathered at the commotion, paid attention, and a crowd started to form, but honestly, the lead… as expected, is that person, it seems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And one man was given the show while sitting in a chair in a café. I hope he dies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t say who’s good and who’s bad, but… I think everyone looks pretty.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””ugh, come on…”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh, you’re allowed to say that!? Why are you all dissatisfied?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, frankly, they’re not all that bad, but… Sadiz has a body that is several times more seductive, Shinobu is more beautiful, even though she has smaller breasts… she may be a thorn in my side, but even the princess would shut them up… at least more than these five crazies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””……………””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage and the others bit their lips and tried to pass behind the crowd while pretending not to see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They seemed to have a lot of mixed feelings about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oops… uh, ugh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Ah…”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the dude, who was about to get up and should die, suddenly stumbled on nothing and crashed into the swimsuits clad girls in front of him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Boin, Fuyon, Mugyu. Such sounds could be heard from the collision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dude, who should die a brutal death, had his face and hands colliding with the girls’ breasts and buttocks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would that happen?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in this situation, no matter who they may be, any woman would have blushed red and turned hellishly furious――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’m sorry, ‘again’ I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Uwaa~, you perv~”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt so weird that I got chills. Eh? Are you used to it? Aren’t you rather happy about it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The girls’ reactions were already too abnormal, it was repulsive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sheesh, can’t help yourself, you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So shameless… fufufu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You have to take responsibility!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~, he touched me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, senior is always…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe if Budeo did the same thing, it would be considered a criminal act.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Se, senior, i, if you want, right here, like this fret fret, please hold me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, I’m sorry I didn’t hear you. What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~~~tsu, come on, senior!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can confidently claim it. Even if he’s not a threat to me, I’m groaning, drop dead already, and I’m getting more and more serious about blowing this dude away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Hey, those guys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly our eyes met, and uh, Choro bitch, I forgot who she was, screamed out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, other bitches and the townspeople turned around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you… eh, hey, why are they naked? That’s disgusting!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, groooss! Budeo is naked, it’ll seriously rot the eyes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Walking around town naked, it’s crazy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, perverts… die!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, they all at once got unpleasant… no, disgusting, perverts, no, not at all, you’re all in swimsuits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You were at school… and you guys… naked… and what are you doing with that young child!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, bokoboko, the dude who should take it upon himself to go die, approached us as his eyes suddenly changed from just a while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m not doing anything wrong. This child is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bang, he stomped on the ground with anger… oh, no good… now is still… three months before I can hit this dude…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, José! Look, this girl… Amae came to school too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh…… come to think of it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They’re with us… we went out for training, and are on our way back. That’s why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage quickly tried to intervene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when he told them why we were doing this, the girls behind reacted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Training?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? Somehow, don’t you complain, Ora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oratsuki, calm down…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, it’s all good. Let’s go quickly, what is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The bitches reacted to the word ‘training’. They were momentarily dumbfounded, but soon after looking to each other…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Training… you guys, no way… pu, hey, hah? Until you got that dirty, you think you can beat José?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu… it’s kind of… unsightly…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why you’re sweaty? I mean, gross. So disgusting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mortriage, too? What’s the point of trying now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t quietly accept defeat… I don’t feel any manly integrity.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were dumbfounded, then laughing… unlike the people in the town who were looking on from a distance, the bitches talked directly to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage and the others bowed their heads in frustration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was in the middle of such a scene and I involuntarily…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kukukuku, Kuhahahahahahahahahaha!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what’s with this guy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Has he gone crazy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone looked surprised at my sudden laughter. However, I couldn’t resist it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No~, Mortriage… it’s fine, you guys.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if they don’t like you, it wouldn’t have a negative in your life… rather, it was good for you… I almost said it out loud unintentionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I thought that women in this country were strange, but there are also some like Karui and Elder Sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, no big deal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed at them, they were just bitches.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, the genius and the maidens seem to be uncomfortable, so let’s get going.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, I turned my back on them and tried to go back to the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, y, you! What’s with the attitude! Somehow, making a fool of us――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… Chiyo and the others… you laughed up your nose at my precious friends!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t stomp the ground again…… the dude who I want to send flying far to the horizon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah… again…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He couldn’t stand what I just said, so he went around in front of me and stomped on the ground again as if I was going to be intimidated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the resentment of the angry girls was drowned out, as the man’s shout overpowered the girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, perhaps Mortriage and the others, perhaps understanding the difference in power, stepped back slightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, for him to snap just like the previous occasions, such a very short-tempered guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… ears fail in the middle of conversation… feet stumble over empty space… short-tempered with sudden tantrums… I see… in the end, for this fellow… tis already too late…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I was shocked in spite of myself, and Tre’ainar muttered with a somewhat serious expression to this dude, who faced annihilation at this rate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Too late? You mean he’s a self-centered bastard who is too far gone to be helped anymore?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it doesn’t matter…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I forgave it at school, but I won’t forgive anyone who does the same thing again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar? Is it all right? Can I blow this guy away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『……………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar? For some reason, stayed silent… what’s wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a somewhat serious look…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… of course. Do forgive with thy open heart.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman’s voice resounded, putting a stop to the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were left speechless by the dignified voice as if the moment had stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That is not an opponent worth thy efforts. Do not bully the weak over this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There she was, a monster overflowing with a presence that seemed to dominate the place by her words alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””High Priestess!!??”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… High Priestess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a presence that surprised the entire town, and even the bitches and dude, who I wanted to hit as soon as possible, had surprised expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the High Priestess, Jamdi’el, walked past me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “José. That’s enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “High Priestess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little surprised. These two… do they know each other…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know not what happened, but… would it matter if thou fought an opponent who is too different in ability?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s … yes, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If there’s anything thou cannot compromise on, he’ll be in the tournament in three months. At that time, unleash it all and leave nothing behind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment…… Jamdi’el glanced at me, just a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that moment her eyes sent feelings Jamdi’el directed only at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the sidelines, it may sound like Jamdi’el’s words just now was a warning that “a strong guy like José shouldn’t bully the weak” but I felt quite the opposite from Jamdi’el’s fleeting gaze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Ah, I see… I now understand… Jamdi’el…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar glared at Jamdi’el with a somewhat sullen expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a contemptuous gaze somewhere in the eyes which looked at a former companion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t understand the meaning at all. What the hell, why was Tre’ainar unable to stomach the current flow?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understand… High Priestess… if you say so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, in response to Jamdi’el’s arbitration…… yes, the dude managed to respond obediently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, let’s go home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “José!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I…… I’ll take everyone’s anger from today… and give it to him in three months… I don’t know if he’ll stay until he can fight me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the dude endured his anger on this occasion, glared at me once with the girls, threw out the lines, and turned away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at his back, I asked Jamdi’el…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That guy… was he someone from the dojo?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? No, no He used to… just a little… kohon…… I’ve been involved with him. It’s that kind of acquaintance.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She admitted that they were acquainted, but I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el’s word “a little” was too simple…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right… but then why can’t he join the dojo? He’s a genius, isn’t he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s a reason for that. It wouldn’t have a very good influence on the other students…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… that’s too cold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I spontaneously felt chills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Um, somehow the irritation I felt for the dude… the man named José disappeared, as a ruthless expression floated for only a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The slightest movement of her mouth. Her words were inaudible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one here could have known what the High Priestess said at that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from the slightest mouth movements, I read:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 DO
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 NOT
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 NEED
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 THAT
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ANY
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
