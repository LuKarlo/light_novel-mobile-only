 The church’s dining hall was large, and there were dozens of sisters present… we were in such a place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, Earth, I want you to eat more and more! Eat up, strengthen yourself, and do well at the tournament no matter what… I hope you do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A number of dishes were brought to the table one after another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fish, noodles, meat, and so on with some seasoning that was different from we have in the Empire, but I had no problems eating any at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or perhaps I should say, it was appetizing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, not just you, Earth, I also want your friends to eat without hesitation.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Taking pride in her skills, which were just as she claimed, Elder Sis Tsukshi served us the meal while wearing an apron over her sister uniform, and ‘we’ devoured it greedily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you. It’s really tasty… and warm… I wonder if this is what home cooking is all about…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, this meat is mine!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wa, something new… wa, this here, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, my tears can’t stop! This and that are so good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the church’s dining hall, where only the sisters were allowed to step in, I and Mortriage’s group were treated to dinner with the other sisters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, Mortriage and the others tried to refrain from eating in the unfamiliar maiden’s garden, but were unable to overcome their hunger, and lined up to eat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other sisters, who were about our age, were glancing at us from a distance, as if they didn’t usually have much contact with young men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, they didn’t talk to each other, and the sisters didn’t look at them with contempt like bitches at the magic school, therefore it was peaceful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa~! Seriously! Inya~ I wanted to see ~, Big Brother and Mr. Machio sparring!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un. It was amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me, Karui was excitedly fussing after hearing about the incident with Machio earlier in the day…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un. Bite, Aaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sticking meat on a little fork for kids and holding it out to me… Amae was sitting on my lap.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well~, Amae. ‘Bite’, is it? Shouldn’t you say, ‘Here, Eat, Earth big brother’ properly?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I sat in a chair to eat at the dining hall, Amae ran and silently jumped up on my lap and occupied it with a “Mufuu”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first she was told off for misbehaving, but she wouldn’t move anywhere else, and it was too troublesome as she made a fuss and cried, so I gave up and allowed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, since the way she talked could continue to influence her in the future, Elder Sis Tsukshi warned Amae to pay attention to her speech.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, with a start, Amae overreacted to the light sermon for some reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Uuu~…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, Amae suddenly looked down and was mumbling. I, Elder Sis Tsukshi, and Karui tilt our heads at her state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… b… other…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hah? What was that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… bi… br… ther…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… eh!?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Soon, I felt like my whole body was struck by lightning… what was that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried asking Amae, who was mumbling on my lap with her face blushed red.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I could ask, Amae jumped off my lap, as if she couldn’t bear it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, without looking back, she ran to the dining hall exit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae, what was that… just now? Hey, I’m not deaf, but I couldn’t understand that much!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I don’t know!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I got what she wanted to say! I understood it, but I wanted to encourage her to say it, so I impulsively pretended not to hear, but Amae did not look back and screamed as she left the cafeteria.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha … ah~, she’s embarrassed… but that child, apparently, seems to like you a lot. Right, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You two played together. I haven’t seen Amae this attached to a man since Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tsukshi, Karui, and other sisters had a wry smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Under such warm gazes and atmosphere, I cringed a little, but at the same time, my heart felt somewhat warm and fuzzy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For some reason… even if the tournament started now, I feel like I could win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”So straightforward!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi oi, child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was really excited, or I was a little pleased… that’s why, I soon felt a little shy and wanted to work harder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya~, but Amae seems to be having fun, and is big sister feeling nervous? Well, it’s always a quiet, silent dining hall, so things are little pitter-patter today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui had a cackling laugh as she described the current atmosphere of the dining room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See, it’s usually just us girls, and except for me, who goes to school, and big sister, who trains at the dojo, the others have nothing to do with young men.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm… but it can’t be helped. In the first place, we have devoted our bodies and hearts to God…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know~. That’s why big sister keeps her feelings for Mr. Machio in her heart――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-b-b, but I’m sure God will forgive me because he’s so generous! Hmm~! So, hmm, I think it’s okay!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Sisters were dedicated to God. I suppose it’s the same for this secluded country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the god they worship was different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s all right, Elder Sis Tsukshi.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Feh? Ah, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “God is very good natured, caring, and he loves people who make an effort, so I’m sure he’ll support Elder Sis Tsukshi.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huag!? E, even if, Earth, I don’t think it’s a good idea to make fun of your Big Sis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t teasing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I could talk directly to the god they worship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Don’t you agree? You would forgive them with an open mind, right? You’ll give your support, right? Oh Great God?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Silence…… dullard…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a wry smile at Tre’ainar, who couldn’t stand being treated as a god without consent, I backed up Elder Sis Tsukshi, who was flustered with her face flushed red.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s right… there are a lot of young people in this church, and other sisters seem to be the same age as us, but why is only Karui attending the magic school?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah… ah~, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I casually asked a question while eating my meal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Karui smiled a little apologetically, as if they were reasonably special circumstances involved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Elder Sis Tsukshi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that… we’re, almost all of us, war orphans… our livelihood comes from church donations, but it’s not like we can afford that much luxury… of course, not everyone’s tuition can be paid… so, at least if only for the future of Karui, who is the second youngest, and Amae, who is the youngest… that’s the way it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi gently stroked Karui’s head while smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui let herself be fawned over by entrusting her body to Elder Sis Tsukshi while being stroked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, the tuition for a magic school was quite high.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, what about the Imperial Academy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No…… it would be expensive. It’s definitely high. In the first place, aristocrats and even the princess attended it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I went through the academy without any questions or any gratitude, but… the reality is that my parents paid my tuition… and, I ran away from home and dropped out…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had some mixed feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, that’s it! Today, for the sake of the sisters, why don’t we have a get-together party instead of just eating separately and glancing at each other? With Senior Mortriage and his friends!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eehh!!??”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Karui! What are you talking about!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, big sister has Mr. Machio, but other sisters don’t have many opportunities like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To Karui’s sudden suggestion, the guy’s shoulders clearly shook with a start… and the sisters looked like their hearts were pounding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although they were only peeking at each other, they seemed keenly interested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though Mortriage and the others were relegated to the corner of the magic school, that did not matter here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I thought a little about Karui’s proposal for a moment, and then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… no, not yet! I’m done eating!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooouuuh, Mortriage! You guys, eat up, and get some after-meal exercise! We’re still haven’t sparred yet!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I immediately finished my own meal, and shouted to the boys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, still in the middle of my meal … and that …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All of a sudden…? That, friendship…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong? We can talk with the sisters, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, they seemed a little puzzled by my sudden remarks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sisters were also a little freaked out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I deliberately said it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaahh You guys, don’t be so care-free! We’re going to make them pay for what they’ve done! Or is this what you guys wanted to do? You want to get to know the girls? Are you satisfied with just that? Is that what changing yourself is all about? That’s wrong! It’s about getting back at those who mocked us! To that end, leave the fun party for later, or you’ll lose the hungry spirit that sprouted up with great effort!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are those who want to go to magic school but can’t, and others who quit on their own, but these guys are still attending magic school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, they were just going through the motions, doing nothing in particular and rotting away. They’ve declared to me today that they want to change themselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that case, I had to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, surprisingly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… that’s right…… yeah…… I was just thinking that I need to work harder and harder!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… Confidence…… Yes, I want to be able to have it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, I can’t just move so suddenly, I’m human.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Except for one, they stood up with glaring eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they haven’t wilted yet, and I was a little impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why, Karui. The social gathering… I’ll ask for it after they gain a little more confidence in themselves… as a reward when they become stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uha~, so passionate, big brother! Well, that might be fun ♪ if possible, it’s better to be stronger and cooler.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, the fun party is postponed a little longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s the spirit! Do your best! Boys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Yes!!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, good grief, these guys…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi cheered for Mortriage’s group.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 None of the other sisters mocked them like the bitches from today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, they were smiling with a gentle look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the cheers, Mortriage and the others became more enthusiastic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou~, tis a good decision, child. As expected, just as you gave your all in the previous match for the maid’s bosoms as a reward.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「S, Shut up…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like I’ve been teased a bit, but well, Tre’ainar’s said it’s a good decision, so it’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I also do exercise after meals and before going to bed… because…… I’m sure there will be training in 【Vier】 while I’m asleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Definitely.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh … which reminds me, I’ve been curious for a while, doesn’t Ja…… the High Priestess have her meals with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While stretching lightly, I wondered why Jamdi’el wasn’t there during the meal and asked, and then Elder Sis Tsukshi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, the High Priestess is probably… with the ‘Goddess’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s been on my mind once or twice, but… “Goddess”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said it was useless to think about Jamdi’el, but I’m still curious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for your support. And first, my apology.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is a wedding party this evening, so I can’t update it tomorrow morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don’t know if it will work out well… anyway, I’ll tell you in advance because it seems impossible tomorrow.
