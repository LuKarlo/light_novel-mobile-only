 I mostly had a grasp of things after sparring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite being disrespected by those damn sows, Mortriage seemed to be an ordinary honor student, with excellent athleticism and magical skills. He didn’t seem inferior to my classmates at the Imperial Academy. Well, except for the Rebal… in this case, I felt that it would be better to put more focus on teaching magic than martial arts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oratski has a decent heart. He’s not good with detailed magic, so I think it’s better to narrow down a few simple magic spells and teach close combat techniques such as martial arts combined with weaponry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mobner easily loses his nerves, but he seems to have a talent for avoiding crises and is good at evasion. That said, he is still quick to run away. I want him to overcome his fears more while teaching him how to evade properly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m wondering if I should make Budeo lose weight or use his weight as a weapon. However, surprisingly, he had the advantage of being ambidextrous. He always ate his meals with both hands as if it was only natural… However, I still had no idea how to make use of this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I finished today’s training with those guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We arranged to meet again tomorrow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, while I was sleeping, I was sparring with Tre’ainar in the world of Vier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Great Demon Flicker!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The rhythm is too monotonous! Add more variety!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought my level of skill had improved due to the experience of sparring with Mr. Machio, but my left fist was still cutting through the air without hitting Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The Flicker’s advantage is the difficulty of evading it. If tis too easily read, it cannot be used to fight stronger opponents.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「tch… Then, speed!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Too slow! The next moves are obvious. Weave in more feints.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ku, ha, haeee!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I could use my footwork to lead the opponent around, but I was still treated lightly during the spar with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Let’s go! Great Demon Smash!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Idiot! Do not strike with such huge motions without thought! You will never land a lucky punch on high-level opponents! It simply creates extra openings.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah, damn, I can’t land a hit…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Right! Such heavy blows are not swung and hit honestly. Control your opponent so that you can hit them and they cannot evade you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t hit him. I can’t touch him. I can’t keep up with his movements.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha, ha, ze, ze…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm… On the whole, you are adequate enough. But as you know, that Machio still hides something. He is the man that received Jamdi’el’s endorsement, you must be even sharper.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha, ha… Osu…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The stronger I became, the more I realized how monstrous Tre’ainar was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Geez, I thought I could go a little longer…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「A thousand years too early. That said, I admit that we are making steady progress.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tch…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let me land one hit. Let me graze him. Let me change his expression a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kept setting the goal of the spars lower and lower, but I can’t achieve it no matter how low I go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that I had become stronger, but after all, the gap with Tre’ainar was too large for me to really understand the power difference yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was reminded of the fact that I didn’t know his ceiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well… I broke the fighting spirit of a child who had lately begun to lose respect for his master…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, I’m not losing respect for him… I think he’s amazing, I appreciate him, I respect him.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fah… ah, oh, oh, hmm, tis so tis so… kohon, well then soon, in addition to training for improving basic performance, I shall teach you a new magic technique.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though Tre’ainar was a little bashful as he told me so, I was so surprised I stood up involuntarily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Magic technique…?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So far, I’ve only learned the Breakthrough and Great Magic Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but lean forward at the proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What is it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fufufufufufu… that… can be applied not only for the Breakthrough, but for other magic as well.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t contain my excitement when I saw Tre’ainar somewhat laughing confidently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is the magic technique that Tre’ainar was talking about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis called ‘Magical Breathing’.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Magic Breath?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time I heard those words, and I inquired about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm, child. How does a person get the oxygen they need into their body from the air?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s… breathing, I guess.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes. And so…… how does a person restore the magic power they have consumed?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? …… That’s…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think about it, it’s a magic lecture. What’s more, the basics that even a kid knows…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s what you talked about when you opened my ‘Magic Hole’, right? Magic power is taken from the magic that drifts in the air into the ‘Magic Tank’ in the body through the ‘Magic Hole’, passageways for the magic power for the body, holds it, and releases the magic power through the magic hole if necessary…… they say. Therefore, the magic power that is consumed takes in the magic that drifts in the air through the Magic Hole.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm, tis so.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was asked a similar question before, and I answered the same way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar nodded, meaning it wasn’t wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then, let us return to breathing… what do you do to take in ‘a good deal’ of the oxygen floating in the air?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? That’s…… like that… you take a big breath… you take a lot of breaths…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes. Then…… how do you take in ‘a good deal’ of the magic drifting in the air?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「………… eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was involuntarily at a loss for words when I asked an unexpected question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, magic power is usually stored in the magic tank of the body, and when it is consumed, the magic that drifts in the air is taken in through the magic hole and restores it. However, that was just a theory, and in my mind, the recovery of magical power was similar to ‘natural healing’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I had never thought about ‘taking a lot of magic from the air’, so I didn’t know how to answer the question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「… Is it possible? Such a thing …」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fufufu. Recovery magic, so to speak, ‘rapidly heal injuries’. Then you would think there was a way to ‘rapidly restore magic’, would you not?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s the answer that Tre’ainar gave, a new magic technique that I will learn. That’s……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That is the ‘Magical Breathing’… instead of relying on nature and time to restore magic power, harvest the magic in the air at your own will and forcibly restore it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s something I’ve never heard of before…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「A… at your own will?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Learn this, and so long as you have physical strength, you will never be unable to use magic for lack of magic power… in other words…… use it during a breakthrough, and the breakthrough will never be interrupted, and you can hit the Great Magic Spiral so long as your physical strength does not fail…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I heard the explanation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Such a cheeeeeeaaaaatttt!!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help screaming, that technique was too foul.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, wait! You’ll be able to recover your magical power right away… in a sense, it’s infinite magic power! Or rather, teach me that from the beginning!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic power does not run out. In other words, it is possible to have longer breakthroughs and a series of Great Magic Spirals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was too much of a foul.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, of course there are risks. Tis not infinite magic power… you still cannot use magic beyond your magic storage capacity, and above all, long breakthroughs and a barrage of Great Magic Spirals would put a constant strain on the body.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s true. But then I wouldn’t have had to think about preserving the breakthrough…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, tis certainly possible for prolonged periods, but at this point, tis better to set a time limit. Consider the burden on the body. That is why, after use you cannot endure the undue burden and end up injured, you may not be able to move properly due to muscle pain, potentially you may ruin the body itself, and if not used properly, you could die afterwards, could you not?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Uh, oh … oh, oooh…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar emphasized the “risk of death” to me with a serious look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gulped at the force of his words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「W, well, I see… there are risks attached to such amazing techniques…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes. People cannot power up so easily. There is always corresponding risk to it… without exception…… right…… without exception.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment he spoke of the risks, Tre’ainar’s eyes became even sharper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, it’s something to give a lot of thought to…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But you can manage such risks with a view on the future rather than what is before you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh…?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Your bout with Toulowe, to offer such an earnest challenge without using the breakthrough and win. An easy victory in the commemorative match was right before you, you put on a conceited display to the opponent to the tune of his futility, and yet are unwilling to use the power you have acquired indiscriminately. Today’s exchange with the Wizarding School small fry is evidence of this. You have a mind to aim for higher levels. That is why I guide you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt that it was praised for something like my attitude as a human, not my skills in punching or footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, yeah … maybe?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a rare thing, so I’m a bit embarrassed… in front of me, Tre’ainar was grinning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fuhahaha, embarrassed are we?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nuh-uh!? I’m not embarrassed!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, you were embarrassed! Fuhahaha tis delightful. Payback for always illuminating me.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tch, you’re surprisingly persistent… hmm? Always…… in the end, you’re embarrassed, aren’t you?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? …… I, I am never bashful!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, you clearly said it now! I heard you!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, now silence! Focus on training! Anyway, we shall begin the lesson on Magical Breathing!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We seemed to have derailed each other’s conversation a little, but in the end, Tre’ainar forcibly restored it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s a draw for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were to talk, I might have been able to drive the Great Demon King to a corner a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now, ‘breathing’ and ‘meditation’ are important for learning magical breathing. Moreover, tis not just breathing and meditation. First of all, tis training to concentrate on breathing and meditation in any situation and to do it precisely. There is a perfect training method for that.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar… it wasn’t, Tre’ainar coughed lightly and immediately started talking seriously, and I sat up and paid close attention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Fufufu, it seems that Jamdi’el was also trying to have the students of the dojo learn Magical Breathing… I witnessed them performing something similar in the dojo, though sporadically.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh!? Well then… can Jamdi’el also use Magical Breathing?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, she cannot. And what was being performed in the dojo was incomplete training. In that case, no matter how much they try, they cannot learn Magical Breathing. In this way, Jamdi’el imperfectly conveys what I once devised, in the hopes that ‘someone will learn it’.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I, is that right… it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis so. And you are in luck. With certainty, I shall guide you correctly. Yes, I am different from Jamdi’el.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar looked confident with a smug expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other day, I was frightened when I saw the “darkness” of Jamdi’el, but when I thought that this guy was much stronger than Jamdi’el, I felt somewhat complicated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well… the best training to learn Magical Breathing…… is a practice called Magical Yoga.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yo… ga? It was the first time I heard of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In this training, tis essential to learn various movements and poses. You should learn my movements and try them later in front of the dojo mirror.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Tre’ainar decided to immediately give me a demonstration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah!? S, see here… eh!?!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I… to conquer my laughter… failed a second time, and received an impact as a result.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I came back yesterday, much earlier than I expected, and I ended up writing… but I couldn’t help it. The world is so cruel.
