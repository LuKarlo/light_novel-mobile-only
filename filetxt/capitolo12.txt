 『By the way, child… the graduation game the princess mentioned earlier, what is it exactly? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, the supplementary lesson is over and I was on my way home. As he walked down the streets of the commercial district, the Demon King asked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? The [Graduation Commemorative Match]?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed. By the name, it appears graduates will compete in front of high-ranking nobles and royalty…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that understanding is not a problem. It means that a few of the top graduates can show off the results of three years study in front of the Emperor. It’s what the tournament is for.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… When will this take place? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Roughly, two months from now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is a showcase of the young candidates before graduation who aim to become warriors, and the top class men can appeal their power to the emperors, aristocrats, and even the heads of each warrior organization, and even to other countries. It is not an exaggeration to say that it’s a once-in-a-lifetime event. And depending on the outcome, it will have a big impact on one’s livelihood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, lately I don’t really care about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… Tis such an event? So? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hnn?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『From your exchange with the princess earlier, you will participate as well, will you not? As you said, it will commence in two months, yet you are quite languid. Are you not motivated? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King pointed that out as if he could see through my inner feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m not that motivated about it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In two months, that princess will win… it’s frustrating, but no matter how hard I try…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… For the time being, I’m preparing myself for the humiliation.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s one of the reasons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the biggest reason for not showing any motivation is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fu… mostly…… tis because of their biased view that only sees you as the son of Hiro… and, tis unlikely you will live up to that expectation. That is what you mean. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis quite reprehensible… for a brat… as you still are. You hate feeling crestfallen as you are lesser than your father, do you not? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the Great Demon King, with a grinning smile, went straight to the heart of the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s not the case… Rather, even if that happens, it’s my father who will be humiliated. If my father can even feel humiliation, that is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not true. It’s an act. I’ve no such feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, my bluff is meaningless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… feeling rebellious are we? But in your heart… you want to get back at your father. You want to get back at the world. Is that not so? But I also understand that you lack the talent to do so. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, I raised my voice while glaring back at him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D-Don’t mess around. What do you know about me to be fit to say something like that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh my, to not refute that I’ve hit the mark… comprehending you is no difficult task. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『All has fallen within expectations. To achieve the unexpected even through stupidity, I believe that is where you cannot surpass your father. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y-You’re wrong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Resign yourself, you will sulk, and then be dispirited. The talent in the well that gave up on going out once he realized his weakness… is this any different? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what I say, it’s useless, and the Demon King sees right through me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was just enough to make me understand, and I clenched my fists in anger and shame.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S-Shut up! The ghost who lost and died shouldn’t be so smug to look down on others!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… What was that? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In general, if I gave up, sulked and became dispirited, what about you? You’re a pathetic guy who’s making excuses for losing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Mmm!? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the time, I proclaimed that while smugly looked down on the Great Demon King, which made his brows twitch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, when did I make excuses for my defeat? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, back then, you did say that my father and the others were unfair.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis no excuse but fact… one-on-one, undoubtedly the victor would have been me! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s kind of funny… now you can say that as much as you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu!? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You actually weren’t that strong, were you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If my foe talks to me so pompously, I will talk back. If you don’t fight back, they’ll relentlessly provoke you as much as they want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Great Demon King drew near me with a fiendish expression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not speak to me as you please, you wretch! Are you calling me a liar?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… It shouldn’t exist, such great pressure would be terrifying by any standard. It’s about to transform into something else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fine! At that time, with but a fraction of my power, I proved that individually I was superior to any of the Heroes.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, while approaching me with such powerful aura worthy of his title, the Great Demon King made a certain proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was defeated in the past, but would have won if my father did not use cowardly methods and was able to read the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …to prove that he was definitely more powerful than my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… You can’t do it, can you? Such a thing. You’re a ghost.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it is impossible for the Great Demon King, who as a ghost can’t see or hear anything except through me, and can’t interfere with reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the Great Demon King……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… You shall act as proof, wretch!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You shall take my place, wielding the power of the Great Demon King! And thus, be witness to my greatness as you blossom! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Now…… What did he say? The Great Demon King…… wants to train me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To begin with, in Two Months Time! In just two months, I shall raise you to such a level that your Princess would offer little challenge! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a situation that began with the hurling of insults to one another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was pressured as it was by the words of the Demon King who was furiously groaning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Right, prepare to begin training without delay! Therefore, purchase all items I tell you to! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, a, are you serious? Um, what am I buying?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『When I speak your every response shall be ‘Osu!’. Now say iiiiiiiiiit! 』 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O…Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so, at least this event will have a huge impact on our strange relationships and the path I’m going take.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And thus, I’ll make a decent Demon King out of you!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, give me a break!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah…… Huge……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was in sixth place for the day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I received the spirit from a lot of spiral friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we get to this point, we’d like to break through the upper barrier and push forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How far are you going? Forever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you continues!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] While I endeavor to be faithful to the setting over any Japanese influence, I decided to keep this one as is. [Osu] seems to have garnered some mainstream usage especially in MMA and I feel it will really showcase the Student/Master relationship between the characters. But if they are any alternative suggestions do let me know.
