 “It will ease the anxiety of the lost lamb a little! Let’s go, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why me, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An amnesia patient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I didn’t know what it meant to lose your memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar. Is there magic that can bring back memories?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the person had amnesia, I asked if it was possible to make them get their memories back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Magic to erase memories. Magic to regain memories erased by magic. Magic to read a subject’s past memories. Such things exist. However, tis impossible to restore the memory of a person who lost their memory, for example, due to an accident or a strong impact on his head.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh… is that so?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, is it impossible to restore the patient who was brought in this time by magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In which case, there wasn’t a way to easily solve this problem with convenient magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The brain is very delicate organ. If memory is lost due to an accident, it may remain in that state for life, or it may suddenly return at a moment’s notice. Do not get too involved and leave it to the doctor and time.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed the pure and innocent Kron was trying to encourage or help such unfortunate patients, but it’s not something I should be too involved in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe I can help her a little bit, but I also have work to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to waste my time on a stranger or ―――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s you guys. Sorry for your morning. See, this girl… oh, even the goddess!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, how do you do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I entered the auditorium, I was frozen the next instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good morning~. Dr. Eisha. So, is that her?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good day to you too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An old woman in a white coat was in the auditorium… I think she’s a doctor, but it wasn’t the old woman, she’s next to her…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… Doctor…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This person… who is it~……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? That I don’t know, so what I’m going to do is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can tell just by seeing normally… this person… is quite strong~…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder sis Tsukshi, whose cheeks sweated slightly, evaluated the woman who was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a mistake, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, she’s there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good morning… that…… I’m sorry for inconveniencing you in the morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman I’m familiar with, who has been with me since I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There she was, Sadiz who I didn’t expect to see in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Are you acquainted?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Why? Why is Sadiz? Acquainted? Not just an acquaintance… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? I, had to run away, but, oh, memory?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And my chest was so tight that I couldn’t believe it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… ah… you’re… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, amnesia. Oh, amnesia… because, it’s impossible… when she saw my face, Sadiz suddenly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, uo, ah, eeeh, ah, aaaaaaahhh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…? Sa, Sadiz!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I couldn’t sort my head out at all, Sadiz immediately held her head down and began to suffer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “C, calm down, are you all right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Oh, huh? What should I do…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They are panicked by Sadiz, who was crying and in pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t move right away and remained stunned…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That one… got her involved as well…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you mean, Tre’ainar? Why? Why is Sadiz here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… do, you know who I am?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, while still holding her head with a heartbreaking expression and tears in her eyes, Sadiz turned to me and asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do I know you? I’m not sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re my… my…… what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz… right now is…… my what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t understand… but…… I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I could get an answer, Sadiz slowly stood up and wobbled over to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was so violently trembling, but her eyes were still staring at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never seen Sadiz look like this before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I just don’t understand… I’m sure I did something to you…… I’ve done something to you… I really want to apologize… and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…!?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz hugged me slowly… firmly…… and wouldn’t let go… this warmth… this fragrance… oh, no, I… already cut off the past… I decided not to look back…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why? I just, can’t let you… never let go again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t want to hear any apologies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t accept it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I left the Imperial Capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not about whether to forgive or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t possible anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――― Don’t! Father! Mother! Demon King killed, uncle, aunt, grandpa, grandma, everyone! Killed by the Great Demon King!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I did that much to Sadiz… I made Sadiz that sad…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm~, do you know Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean? Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What can I say about my relationship with Sadiz now … what … but … but!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you…… don’t… remember…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such a selfish… thing to say… bye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cried enough. I got up. I made a vow. And yet, something like this happened!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth? What’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart was shaken. My eyes were burning. They were overflowing more and more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t stop it anymore…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you don’t remember, don’t apologize so easily!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I twisted and pulled away from Sadiz, who was hugging me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My vision was so clouded that I couldn’t tell what was right in front of me… so unbecoming… shamelessly, I ranted and raved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t even know what you did wrong! You can’t even remember! And right away, you’re sorry? Drop the bullsh*t! Don’t throw that out so easily! It was really painful… it was hard… my heart… it hurt… but…… I…… I cut it off and moved on! Everything…… I threw away everything I ever had… that’s how I got back up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron… Elder Sis Tsukshi… the sisters… the doctor were puzzled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn’t have the presence of mind to worry about it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If…… you don’t… even… remember… then, don’t throw it out! Why, why are you getting in my way?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m so…… sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, I told you not to apologize! I don’t want to hear those words… I ran away, but… why do you ignore my feelings and say that? Why…… why…… wh…… y…… is it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you think I am? But I know. But I know, there’s no way I could ask Sadiz that question right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the current Sadiz doesn’t remember anything about me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even if I say this to Sadiz, who was currently unstable, it would only confuse her. It would just hurt my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To those around us, it could only be seen like I was cursing a weak woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… this is…… it was too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~… never would I have expected this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the voice mixed with darkness echoed in the auditorium with an intimidating chill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, the person standing there was Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Jamdi’el…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s the High Priestess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I say… ah, this girl is the unidentified lady…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el walked past Kron, Elder Sis Tsukshi and the doctor, and came up to me and Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who had no idea what was going on, was just flustered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… I feel obliged to give God an apology… the magic I imperfectly learned… it would seem that even those who I didn’t want involved were brought along. I never realized the coordinates were out of alignment. Moreover, the spell is quite troublesome to operate…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally understood with those words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see, the magic that brought me here. Sadiz was also swept away by that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Jamdi’el herself hadn’t noticed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does the memory loss have anything to do with it? Was she sent to a different place than I was? Did she get hit in the head?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t understand. There was only one thing I did know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In any case, Earth Lagann has me. And in three months… Fufufufu… our goddess… Fufu! Well, that’s why. Be gone without delay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood. It’s hostility. That Jamdi’el was hostile towards Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Ah… Ah… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Has thou no memory? In that case, it may have been fortunate to save us the trouble of eliminating thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thereupon, I wondered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, I had been struggling to find the right words to describe the relationship between me and Sadiz, my heart and mind were messed up with emotions of anger and sadness, but at this moment I was not lost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… we’re in the middle of…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do not interfere.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next thing I knew, I was standing in front of Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the beach, I was so terrified by the overwhelming difference in strength that I couldn’t move. But now, I moved without thinking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~… thou can give such a sinister gaze.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… well, I’m just so irritated… I can’t hit the person I really want to hit… it’s too much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… brat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a crushing sense of intimidation came over me, as if my cheeky attitude got on her nerves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, a tense atmosphere flowed through the auditorium, and Elder Sis Tsukshi and the others were also at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Noo~…… you’re in front of a patient! Don’t!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~… don’t!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… tsu, La, Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without reading the mood, as if unafraid, Kron, swelling her cheeks, lightly put her hand on my and Jamdi’el’s heads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “hey…you, what do you think you’re doing!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You heard me! Like I said, I’m in the middle of something right now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The unexpected interruption… was Kron, unable to read the atmosphere with a carefree tone…… I got even more irritated and shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, ah, Earth!? Wh, what did you say to the goddess!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wh, what… th, this young man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oi… Earth Lagann… thou is being impolite to Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is the other party a goddess? A woman? Kron? I am well aware.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It has nothing to do with her, leave…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sheltered girl, who knew nothing, I almost shouted at her to shut up and leave. However, I choked on my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… calm down.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s, because…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh… uo…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I got annoyed with Kron’s nonchalant words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I felt Kron’s eyes, as she was calling my name, staring straight at me without looking away. They somehow had a strong will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When she looked at me with those eyes, I strangely felt like an effeminate and miserable person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well then! To calm down… let’s all have an early morning tea time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron made a proposal with a smile, as she clapped her hands together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know what I was going to do or what I wanted to do, and before I realized it, I was stuck on the spot.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
