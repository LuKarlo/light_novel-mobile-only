 Even though it was called early morning tea time, I didn’t feel like I could have a refreshing morning now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that doesn’t mean I’m going to leave her to run away. Would I leave it to Jamdi’el, who once showed hostility towards Sadiz?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m still not rotten enough to do that, regardless of my doubts towards Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well. So, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This person’s name is Sadiz, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sat down at the table in the dining hall, along with Kron, Jamdi’el, Elder Sis Tsukshi, Old lady Eisha, and several sisters. We were all served tea as we talked and held a discussion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took a sip of my tea and nodded a little grudgingly to Kron , who started the conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. This is Sadiz. 19 years old. In my country… she was working at my home… as a maid……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Meyid…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… she does housework… and helps make the meals.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see! So Sadiz is good at housework and cooking, is she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron nodded with interest while smiling, and the others responded with “Heh~”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The relationship between me and Sadiz wasn’t really just that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Master and maid. It must have been different. The days we’ve spent together were different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, having abandoned it, I felt that it would be wrong to rephrase it now, and as a result, I was saying something bland about the relationship between me and Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I served …… you, didn’t I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I mean… to be precise, my father and mother… but you… well, took care of me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I almost said, “you cherished me like a brother.” But, I endured somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I felt like I might say something if I wasn’t careful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Then, how about Sadiz live here for a while when she settles down, cleaning the church, doing the laundry, cooking meals and helping everyone?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””………… eh?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara? What’s wrong? Everyone. Let’s have a cup of tea and start off the day! Tsukshi, please teach Sadiz a lot of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought that I had to be careful, Kron’s unexpected remark caught me and the others off guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised to hear that, because normally I thought she would be inquiring about me, since I had only given him a little information about Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I thought the doctor, Elder Sis Tsukshi, and other sisters, who did not know much about my background in the first place like, were “prepared to ask and inquire” with that intention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, Kron wasn’t talking about our past, but about how Sadiz, who woke up and lost her memory, would live her life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no, Goddess… first of all, we should learn more about Sadiz… in the first place, I would rather we take the opportunity to learn more about Mr. Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? But we can always ask Earth about that at any time, so I think it’s important to talk about Sadiz’s life first.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah… erm, well, that’s right~…? No, but, look, Earth and Sadiz… somehow… you can call it a relationship under special circumstances… by Earth’s reaction…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi asked Kron in bewilderment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, Elder Sis Tsukshi seemed to think that “normally we should look into their past more” as I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Kron had a vacant expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But the most important thing is not what you have done in the past, but what you will do from now on, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No…… she’s not wrong… yeah, it’s correct, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And it seems Earth doesn’t want to talk about it, does he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why he didn’t give too much detail, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? No, um. That’s not wrong either. That’s why I chose my words with care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But could this carefree, sheltered, natural-airheaded lady know that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understand. I think there was a painful past for both Earth and Sadiz. I think it was very hard for them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, w, wait. Don’t make your own assumptions even though you don’t know much about it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if she could see through everything and judged me without my permission, which I didn’t like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but give Kron some harsh words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, you have no painful memories, only pleasant ones? Is that something you can say?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, who! Why do I have to tell someone who has nothing to do with it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so? Then, isn’t that what we are discussing here and now, what we are going to do from now on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… that’s true, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Am I? Is it me who’s wrong? Me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sure Sadiz is having a hard time and would like to know what happened in the past, and I’d love to hear from Earth if he can tell me. But I felt now wasn’t the right time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least, after a little more time… after calming down… it’s like it putting off… the answer or the problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at least now I could sort out my mind enough to answer the questions that are being asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, the fact that Sadiz was here and she lost her memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore, in any case, Sadiz will be here for a while…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I’m only going to talk about what’s to come. And I think Sadiz should work here for a while, resting her mind and body. Wouldn’t it be fine with Jamdi’el and Tsukshi?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? No, but that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I think that’s fine~…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed, by the flow of the conversation, Sadiz will be staying in this country for a while, and in fact, in this church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not something I can oppose or express my opinion on, I was a freeloader yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you for your consideration. But… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. And Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But she’s also asking for my opinion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz asked, “Is it really fine when there are people who don’t like me?” with concern.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s genuine question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if I’m being tested to see what I’m made of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But do I disagree?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or do I leave?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But can I allow Sadiz and Jamdi’el to live together beyond my reach?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I…I don’t have any objections…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I could only say such throwaway words in a daze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Sadiz. I’m sure you’re going through a lot, but we’re here to help you as much as we can, so please take care of us from now on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, thank you… for your… help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, no one could complain and Kron quickly rounded up the conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi also had a strained smile, but she nodded immediately and was ready to welcome her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me, all I could do was hold my head and wonder how it all came to this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, for such a beautiful woman serve Earth~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As the goddess says, I didn’t listen to everything right now… but…… Earth seems a bit naughty, and I’m sure Sadiz had a tough time with you, didn’t she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi threw a little jeer at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not sure what to say about that. I’m sure it was hard for her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, but then… I know Sadiz worked at Earth’s house, but… what about Sadiz’s family?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Family…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because Sadiz’s family doesn’t know that she’s here, right? I’m sure they’re worried…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, they would be worried… even if it’s… my father and mother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I answered Elder Sis Tsukshi’s question, everyone had a stunned expression for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? By any chance…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth and Sadiz… are siblings? That? But she worked at Earth’s house…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no it’s wrong. Um…… ah~, Sadiz’s parents are… already… well… so she’s like an adopted child in my family…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not simply that I don’t want to talk about it, it’s a past that’s hard to talk about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, it was not easy to tell Sadiz, who has lost her memory, that “her real parents are long dead”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it seemed that Elder Sis Tsukshi had guessed it by my current attitude, so she nodded and didn’t ask any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, one person was a little interested in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… in other words, thy parents took the girl in…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Jamdi’el. Jamdi’el, who knew about my father and mother, seemed a little surprised that she was adopted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An orphan… but why would they do that? Such a thing would have been commonplace… why would thy parents, only take this girl?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s see. It was my mother’s decision… I think. A long time ago, it was destroyed… where was it? I’m sure it was called Shiznautmy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!!??』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, who had been silent all this time, panicked and shouted to stop me, and Jamdi’el…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see… huh… I see… then…… is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el said nothing more in particular. However, she quickly stood up and turned away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Teach the lady on various matters. Do tell the others as well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes… I understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I shall go to the basement as I have a little work to do. I ask of thou to handle the rest.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Jamdi’el suddenly stood up and quickly left the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, on her mouth, she had a curiously hoarse, chilling smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it? What did Jamdi’el just react to?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
