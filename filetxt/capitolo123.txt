<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The room assigned to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had minimal furniture, a desk, and shelves with small and difficult books, such as the Bible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the morning, I did some road work, took a bath, had breakfast, and had tea time, so the bed sheets and change of clothes were still cluttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t bring myself to sort it out just yet, so I sat on the messy bed and sighed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… eh… the matter with me and her…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think about it, I just naturally muttered to myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, no matter how hard it hits, I would still be concerned about her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what’s more, she will be living together with me in this church from today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, we will meet face to face many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if she doesn’t remember me, it’ll be awkward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『On that matter child… I was much too careless… I should have cautioned you…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… you should not have mentioned that maid’s ruined birthplace…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being said, I recall the conversation at tea time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I told that story to Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what does that have to do with anything?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… you mean Sadiz’s hometown that was already destroyed?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By my hands.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… y, yeah… now that you mentioned it…… that’s right. Somehow, it completely slipped my mind…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, no, no, the cause lies with you… well, be that as it may.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used the Great Magic Spiral in my match. However, it was actually the technique that Tre’ainar used when he destroyed Sadiz’s hometown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who was there at the time, recalled those childhood memories, went crazy, and blurted everything out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, that was a cause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I don’t blame Sadiz for reacting that way. In fact, I would be traumatized if my family and neighbors were killed right in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I wouldn’t go so far as to blame it on that, even if it was the cause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it was just the trigger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feud between me, my father and my mother has been accumulating for a while. It just exploded in that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, Tre’ainar was also concerned about the Great Magic Spiral and Sadiz, but I didn’t particularly care. And when I was running away from home and crying, it was a problem that me and Tre’ainar had discussed and solved already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I didn’t really care about that anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, why now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jamdi’el is now aware… that maid… is the survivor of Shiznautmy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………? …… what does it mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah… Jamdi’el… at that time…… she also was there.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Seriously?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh. And she is one of the few in the Demon King’s Army… to know the truth about Shiznautmy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An earnest expression. A heavy tone. That Tre’ainar looked more serious than ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That alone made me feel that I was in a pretty troubling situation, I’m just not aware of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Shiznautmy… that much…… em…… was it an important place? I’ve only ever known Sadiz’s hometown as a magical city…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A city dedicated to mage research institutes and scholars… as such, it was a place of some renown, but … in general that is.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar purposely emphasized “in general”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then… was it different for you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I… and a few of my Six Supremacy were aware of the truth… and among them was…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s hometown. I’ve never heard of it from Sadiz herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father and mother never talk about it, it was before I was born, and Sadiz didn’t seem to be dwelling on the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I had only heard that it was the “Demon King Army” that destroyed Sadiz’s hometown. In reality, it seemed that it was the “Great Demon King” himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as I had already run away from home, I didn’t do anything to dig deeper into the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a war between the Surface World and the entire Demon Realm. Then, it wouldn’t be strange even if villages, cities, or whole countries perished in such a war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it was Sadiz’s hometown, I felt “what’s the point of asking now?”. That’s how it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it seems that this is not the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… what was it? Shiznautmy… what happened there?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I had to hear the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not so much the people of the Sorcery City, Shiznautmy … tis the land… deep beneath the land… there lies the legacy of all beginnings… the people of Shiznautmy who happened to live there… discovered the legacy and set out to exploit it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a story that seemed so grand and yet so unfamiliar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The legacy is not something that can be so easily analyzed by scholars in the City of Sorcery, much less utilized, tis so complex that it would take thousands of years for humans with shorter lifespan than the demon race, so enormous and tremendous… yet…… with their half-baked knowledge, technical skills, and magic, they tried to reach for such an outrageous taboo…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Taboo?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The Legacy of All Beginnings… among them is… the power to revert everything zero…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this point, I couldn’t think of what to respond with or what questions to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I didn’t think that a story of such a large scale could be related to Sadiz’s hometown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nevertheless, the city was destroyed. And by my hands…… by my Six-Gate eyes, the legacy was stringently sealed. The seal remains even after my demise. No longer could anyone reach the Legacy. Tis fortunate that the people of Shiznautmy did not share their research information with the entire human race. Perhaps the truth of Shiznautmy was incomprehensible even to Hiro and the Seven Heroes. The only one who might have gained an inkling was … perhaps Mikado…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was a city that was already gone, and Tre’ainar seems to have dealt with that legacy, before the fall of the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there’s no point in digging up that story now, is there? …… I thought so for a moment, but then Tre’ainar wouldn’t speak about it with such a serious expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Although inferior to my Six-Gate eye… if tis her Heraldic eye… if tis only to lift part of the seal…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I had severely admonished that one… my conviction was clear, and yet…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew it. Then, no wonder Tre’ainar looked so serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then Jamdi’el could zero out everything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Jamdi’el has that ridiculous magic…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis not that. What Jamdi’el took out and used… tis probably a different legacy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Different?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was panicked for a moment, but I was told that it was different and I couldn’t help but feel annoyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed. The legacy that Jamdi’el used is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, do you have a minute? I’m coming in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『”Nuo!!??”』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was too focused on the conversation. A voice was calling me with a knock from the other side of the door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Elder Sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, what? Elder Sis Tsukshi.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I think I’ll help you clean up for a minute.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi came in saying so, wrapped in an apron, rolled up her arms, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Excuse me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, with a bucket and broom, appeared from behind Elder Sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, it’s like you said, right? Miss Sadiz was doing housework and things like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes… well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But Miss Sadiz has lost her memory, so I thought I’d try to see if she could do it properly… is Earth’s room, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, sure… what…… that’s… well then…… should I leave?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Would you mind killing some time? Visit the dojo or play with Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until just before, I was talking about the history of the world, so I was shocked when they suddenly came in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, come. Shall we continue the conversation at the sea?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That would be good.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With my heart still racing, I walked past Elder Sis Tsukshi and Sadiz, trying not to make eye contact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Excuse me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz said something to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kept my back turned, I didn’t reply and I didn’t stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t that I was ignoring her out of spite.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just hard coming face-to-face with Sadiz or exchanging words right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’ll start cleaning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, Miss Sadiz!? Why are you suddenly crawling on all fours and peeking under the bed?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…? Certainly…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm… why I wonder? It’s just that, the moment I tried to clean it, I had to check under the bed first…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, you say that, but why did you go to the bookshelf next?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? …… that? I’m not sure why… I feel like something was hidden by camouflaging the spine of such difficult books…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, now you opened the desk drawer… why? What could possibly be at the bottom of the drawer!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… eh? I don’t know. However, I thought the drawer might have a double bottom…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “While saying, why in the ceiling!? What sort of procedure is that!?” [1] [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The voices I heard from the room made me stop in the middle of the hallway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t say it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right away, what I learned from Sadiz today is that even if you don’t remember the past, your body will move naturally due to your ingrained habits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feeling that way, Tre’ainar and I went to the sea again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 500,000 characters are achieved. I am not updating it every day, and the story that started in mid-May has so many characters at the moment, I’m the one who worked hard. Well, rather than trying hard, it means that the author has that much free time… I don’t plan to go out with anyone on holiday…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It will be difficult to make 100 by the end of this year, but I would like to continue, so I look forward to working with you in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Give it up Sadiz! You’ll never find his Stash now!! Thank you 【Canonicon】!!!
