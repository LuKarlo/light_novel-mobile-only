 『Magical Biotechnology! My cells! And the power of the Great Demon necessary for the vessel! In other words, Jamdi’el’s goal was to bring you and Kron together to have a child, and to make the conceived child the God of the next generation!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… What the hell!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The true purpose of the former Six Supremacy, which is unknown to the Allied Forces, the Empire, and the Seven Heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shocking truth that Tre’ainar deduced is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I can’t understand if it’s too sudden! The explanation so far is too unclear, and I can’t swallow the conclusion!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I suppose…… I thought so half way through. Even if given a simplified explanation, it will not be transmitted, and nevertheless I will have to give a drawn out explanation…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Especially… what was it? Genetic information? Creating someone with similar cells? Is that Kron? …… not good, I’m hearing so many unknown words for the first time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar talked about the past while looking at the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s so grandiose that I can’t really keep up with it. What the hell was that Shiznautmy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I said it, did I not? Tis not about Shiznautmy, but the legacy that existed beneath the land of Shiznautmy. Tis no skill or magic that the Shiznautmy settlers had created.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After explaining at length, Tre’ainar finally told me with a terrible expression, but most of what was said was something that even I, who should be reasonably smart, could not understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And what bothers me is… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was explained at length in a lot of words, but… really…… Kron… isn’t your biological child… is she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No! I have been single my entire life!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But there’s a blood connection, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather, she is a being with the same gene.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good. I can’t understand. But, I can say that Kron isn’t just a demon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that Jamdi’el is over-protective, calling her “goddess”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although Kron is apparently not Tre’ainar’s biological daughter, she is the same as Tre’ainar. This didn’t make any sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, if you look closely… she doesn’t resemble you… does she? Hmm…… I just met her this morning, and I didn’t really look at her face.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, the environment in which I grew up, what I learned, my experiences, tis all different…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that Tre’ainar doesn’t recognize her or anything like that, it’s that Kron isn’t really his real daughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, does that mean Tre’ainar has been single all his life?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I still don’t really understand the legacy that sleeps under Shiznautmy… for the time being, let’s leave it… here’s the problem.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why is Jamdi’el trying to marry me and Kron?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s the number one problem. I just didn’t understand the reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not about marriage. Tis about conceiving a child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s the same! You have to get married to have children! A man and a woman who are tied together in love… um…… exchange diaries, dates… becoming intimate and so on… you need enough income to have a family.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why is that? You are pure hearted only on such matters…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, why sigh there!? What am I doing wrong now!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No… tis fine. You were raised as such.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar nodded to me with a tremendously warm look. I wonder if I’m being ridiculed or treated as a child…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, my question itself shouldn’t be wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would I have a child with Kron?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis simple. A person with the same gene as me… mates with someone who has inherited the skills and soul of the Great Demon… an existence with said gene and soul would be born… exactly, I would be. That is likely what Jamdi’el desires.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What she wants is not Kron, but a child born by Kron? Moreover, a child fathered by someone able to inherit Tre’ainar’s techniques and stuff?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The current being named Kron is a form created so a soul may be installed into… tis so. No matter the extent to which the created organism possesses the same genes as me from my cells… tis not the same as me… or something to that effect, that is what Jamdi’el is thinking, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, seriously? How does that make sense?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps, the winner of the tournament in three months time will become the target, and Machio was a prime candidate. However, Machio cannot use the Great Demon Spiral or my other exemplary Great Demon techniques. Then, Jamdi’el discovered that you could use the Great Demon Spiral. Perhaps Jamdi’el thought, rather than Machio, you were more suitable to have a child with Kron.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but I’m human, doesn’t that bother her? Also I’m the son of the man who defeated her God, right? More or less.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You can use the Great Demon Spiral… tis a trivial matter in the face of that fact.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, all we have talked about until now were only Tre’ainar’s own predictions. It remains to be seen whether Jamdi’el’s true purpose was really as Tre’ainar says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if that’s the case, even with Jamdi’el’s messed up thinking…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way… Elder Sis Tsukshi likes Machio, but she asked me to take the championship…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Should Machio win, Kron and… would be the outcome, I suppose she did not approve.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good… somehow… I felt like the topic was starting to come together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there was another doubt to be addressed there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But. Then, Jamdi’el should teach Kron the Arcane True Zenith. Don’t go out of your way to get her with an Arcane True Zenith practitioner and make them have a child. From that point of view, it’s not perfect, but isn’t that still faster?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el went to the trouble of taking in disciples, training them, and teaching Tre’ainar’s skills, even if in a half-baked way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the best user among them is made to take Kron and have a child, and the child is raised as the next God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than going through such a roundabout way, Jamdi’el should teach Kron directly from the start. That would be quicker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why doesn’t she?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That… there is a reason… although I cannot be certain yet, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Trainer became obscure on that point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a slightly dispirited look on his face and didn’t say any more, seemed he was not yet at the stage where he could tell me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, Treina’s prediction was that one way or another, Kron will have a child with the winner of the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, if that’s the case…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Wait a minute. If the story so far is true… then if I…… win overall victory at the tournament… Kron and… d, do that, is it? Ah, that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That would be Jamdi’el’s intention, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, at…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, not at all, how is it OK to do something so absurd?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and having kids? Does that mean marrying Kron?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But can I be a parent to a child?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought of such things when I talked with Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I haven’t given Shinobu my answer yet, yet I would have a child before answering her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Kron may be pretty cute, but… that nude body of hers that I saw in the bathroom. Involuntarily Canonicon… if I’m told that could be mine, certainly… but then Shinobu is also beautiful… well, they both lose to Sadiz in bust size and… eh?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I head-butted the sandy beach as hard as I could.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… why am I even thinking of Sadiz at this point~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I know why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter the moment, Sadiz was my first love, my one-sided crush and the period of wild fantasies has been going on for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Love, marriage, child-making, and when it comes to such topics, she would eventually come up after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I meant to win the championship, but… marriage and children?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Leave the matter of marriage aside… but on the subject of conception, what troubles me is… in three months time… even if you defeat Machio, I do not expect you would gain the strength required to resist Jamdi’el. You know what that means, do you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, even if I grow strong enough to win the championship, I won’t have the power to go against Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, when the time comes, I will be forced to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cur… if Kron is to your liking as a woman, then there is no harm is such events, you may even consider it a perk.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no way! That… that’s something I just can’t… I would feel sorry for the child I’m born with.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『O, oh, i, is that so… well, however… that said, should you lose the tournament… you, who are no longer of use, would incur the wrath of Jamdi’el…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That would be too unreasonable! Is she the devil!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『She is a fallen Seraph…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were various sudden devastating facts, situations, and information, and I was somewhat exhausted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just purely pursuing strength and winning the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That didn’t seem to be enough, but I didn’t know what to do, so I was staring at the sea with Tre’ainar for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in the end, all I knew was that I still had to get stronger either way.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
