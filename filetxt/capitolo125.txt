 There’s nothing worse than training while your mind is wandering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After talking on the beach, my training started late, and I decided to start right there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Tre’ainar checking on me, I took a yoga pose and focused my attention. However, I couldn’t help letting my mind wander.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are sorely lacking concentration.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s hard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the pose was wobbly and disorganized. I just couldn’t concentrate and my mind was getting distracted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I win the tournament, I’ll make a child with a girl I just met. However, when thinking about it, Shinobu and Sadiz kept going through my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My oh my… tis what makes you an amateur at romance…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!? No, but if you’re a lifetime bachelor, that makes you a beginner at love!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Mu, su, such may be true, but even though I had no special partner, I was adored by hundreds of thousands, even millions!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I guess that Jamdi’el came to be as a result!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The training is interrupted due to our trivial quarrel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shook my head as this wasn’t working, I just couldn’t get into the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, if you lack the fortitude to draw out a certain level of ability in any mental state, no matter how much ability you acquire, will you be unable to make the most of it? In fact, if you go out into the world, you will witness the cruel and tragic reality that can mentally break you. However, if you remain concerned over mere relationships with the opposite sex, would I not fear for the future?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, you’re right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so, the Magical Breathing cannot be mastered by one who is in constant turmoil, now can it? Tis a technique of such extreme difficulty that not even Jamdi’el could learn it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s right, my worries may be very ridiculous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, they’re still more than enough for me to be distracted right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t grasp the right moment to settle my mind, so I sighed and looked at the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, neither can I!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My goodness…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stood up, scratching my head, quit yoga without permission and started shadow sparring on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t very conscious of my form, and didn’t particularly imagine an opponent. I just punched right in front of me, as if to shake off my pent-up feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, the shadow fits the occasion. Like that maid, it seems you have mastered the movements to a complete degree.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A crisp left jab. A right hook that sent dust flying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this alone cannot reach the Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was still a difference. Overwhelmingly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, now that I’ve abandoned the magic sword, I have to fight with this fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that purpose, I didn’t have time to dawdle over nonsense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pathetic. Not only power, but also my heart was weak, I fell into self-loathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what I’m…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ji~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uowa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, there was someone hiding behind a tree on the beach, staring at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the horns were protruding, it’s clear who the culprit was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, the ‘third’ party I didn’t want to see at the moment suddenly appeared, and I turned my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you doing, Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara, I’ve been discovered. But don’t worry about it, please continue.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How long have you been there? Were you listening to me talking alone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rest assured. She was not present during our conversation.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, Tre’ainar assured me that she had not heard anything important, but I was still a little nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because if I win the tournament, we’ll…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, just, what are you doing, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what are you doing in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The cherished goddess was alone. no……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be there. Not in the sky.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t dare look up. But right above me. I felt a presence in the distant sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A winged woman was watching from a distance, close enough to swoop down at any time if anything happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the fact that she’s watching at a distance in this way means that me and Kron are officially authorized to talk to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Kron, who had been hiding behind a tree, smiled and showed herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A basket in hand that seemed stuffed full of something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I brought Earth’s lunch. I thought we could eat it together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, Jamdi’el really seems to trust Earth. She wouldn’t usually allow me to appear in public so lightly, but this time she even said, ‘It doesn’t matter if I’m a little late.'”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron smiled without any doubt. Perhaps Jamdi’el wants us to get closer like this so that we can have children smoothly without any problems after I win… but if she’s so blatant about it, what if I really can’t win the tournament?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s movements… I was watching.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was so beautiful. Ko, Pyu, Pyu, Bun! Like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron excitedly tried to punch me by imitating my shadow. That alone made it clear that Kron herself has not been trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can I see more?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Kron asked so with carefree eyes. The look in her eyes made me feel uncomfortable, so I turned away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s not interesting to watch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s very nice. It’s as fast as lightning, and it blows wind like a tornado. You move beautifully like a dance, so I could watch it forever.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I looked away, they were still staring at me. It’s embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shadow sparred to hide the embarrassment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron sat on the beach and kept watching gleefully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Kron spoke to me halfway through. I answered her bluntly without stopping my hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why is Earth working so hard?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A simple and pure question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why am I trying so hard?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The answer is simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To get stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why do you want to be strong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because I’m a weak, helpless bastard who can’t do anything… I want to be strong enough to accomplish something. That’s all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron nodded again and again, smiling at my answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you satisfied with this answer?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is… a liar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because that’s not all, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her abrupt words stopped my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m not lying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. I understand. I think what Earth really wants is something different.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if somewhat sure, Kron affirmed with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey wait a minute, what’s with the sloppy… just, then what do you think I’m doing this for?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That remains to be seen. But I think what Earth really wants is not just strength, but something more.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For my part, I really didn’t mean to lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It must have something to do with Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So Kron said, “What?” and I was a little upset that the girl I had just met today knew that in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar nodded at Kron’s words, somewhat impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That reaction from Treina, who now sees me more than anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, it’s like saying Kron’s words were not wrong, and I couldn’t help but react.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I couldn’t ignore Kron’s words as just foolish, and I had no choice but to listen to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… do you think so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My intuition.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Intuition!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. So if you could tell me a little more about Earth, Earth’s past, the people Earth has spent time with so far, the people Earth has met so far, I might understand more…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are those words saying, “Tell me about your past”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the dining hall, she didn’t try to dig the root, about me, Sadiz …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, leave that for now, aren’t you hungry now? Here, a sandwich for you~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to put up my guard, but Kron didn’t particularly try to pursue it, opened the basket she had and showed me a sandwich that would be enough for two people from inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, they made it for me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apart from that, it wasn’ t handmade by Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the sandwich she showed me. Just by looking at it, I recognized it immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… the one who made it… you don’t have to tell me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, naturally I would know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many years have I eaten this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Please enjoy it as much as you want~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaah, here~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaah”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I hesitated because I knew who made it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Kron offered it to me as if she didn’t know my feelings or didn’t mind knowing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She doesn’t even know what I’m thinking, and it’s kind of annoying. But it’s cute…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Losing to the push, I reluctantly received the sandwich I had been offered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can eat it myself”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hesitating for a few seconds, I gave up and ate the sandwich.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I took a bite, I suddenly froze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, sandwiches only tasted like bread and ingredients.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the sandwich that “She” made was an exception.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I once ate a sandwich at a cafe in the Imperial City, but I wasn’t impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since then, I’ve only eaten sandwiches that she made for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… ts……tsu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been eating this since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? It hasn’t been that many days since I left home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I really missed the taste of this sandwich.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fluffy texture of bread. The crispy lettuce. The original sauce smeared on ham.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it good?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t twist it and say things like “it’s bad” or “I don’t want to eat it again”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I agree… Hmm~! It’s wonderful! It’s really delicious! I’ve never had such a delicious sandwich!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I had been alone, I might have cried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, because Kron was here, like hell I would ever cry, I welled up my tears and suddenly endured it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My oh my… such determination… yet still a sentimental heart … as ever.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But… what does the child truly desire…? To be sure, obtaining strength is but one means of acquiring it. To see through you so easily, tis pretty sharp, albeit a copy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar muttered, as he looked at me and Kron with a sad expression, and looked up at the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, in any case… whatever the child’s desires, if that maid is of genuine Shiznautmy lineage, there is a possibility of awakening ‘that power’… and Jamdi’el will attempt to obtain it… thus, tis now to the level which even after winning the tournament three months later, the child must fight against that… but!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar seemed to have decided something in front of me, I was a little shaken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I will not allow everything to go according to Jamdi’el’s plans! I would have them disrupted by all means. That one violated my command!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that declaration, Tre’ainar’s eyes, as he scowled at Jamdi’el in the sky, were somewhat aggressive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Authors Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have mentioned it several times before, but I would like to say it again after a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s gender is “left to the readers’ individual judgment”.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
