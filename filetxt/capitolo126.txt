 After I had gone through the whole training session at sea, it was quite late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I could have pushed myself further by the sea as it was, but it was about time the classes were over for the Wizarding School.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe Mortriage’s crew will arrive soon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I thought we should go back immediately, and as Kron and I were walking toward the dojo on the way home, we heard a voice echo through the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! My Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Along with the sound of someone shouting, glances gathered all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true! It’s the Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What a lovely day this is! I never thought I’d see the Goddess outside other than the day of the congregation!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T, trully, how… How beautiful!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, she’s a goddess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way back to the church from the beach, I felt that as I passed through the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good day to you everyone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the busy Central Street, which was crowded, people split to the left and right in an instant, and everyone knelt, bowed, and their eyes were shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you really that grateful?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the people were delighted when Kron simply smiled and waved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See, Earth should also smile and wave to everyone.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who should do that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I might attract some weird attention, so let’s just walk away…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~~~~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Goho!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From across the open street, a little girl rushed over and dove towards my belly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mu~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae suddenly jumped in without greetings. She looked somewhat upset, and her cheeks were puffed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… you left on your own…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? No, that’s not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Only the Goddess with you… were you playing together?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, just some training. What? Did you want to play?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, is that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s so cute, getting jealous of a goddess that everyone worships.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Some other time, later. I have to train at the dojo again, so I’ll see you after that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was staring at me like, “Really~?” or “You promise?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I’m not sure how I feel about this, but I’m relieved that she’s so fond of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was like an older sister to me, so is this how it feels to have a younger sister?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara ara, Amae, how do you do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Goddess…… Good day to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, even children know what to say here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae let go of my waist, as she clung to me, corrected her posture, and bowed her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Amae quickly turned around and grabbed my hand and pulled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Woah okay! Don’t pull.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, she gave the least amount of greeting, but maybe she’s jealous of me being taken. I came to be pleased with myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, Amae is good friends with Earth~. Then I shall join hands too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Kron reached out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, do you mean to hold hands with me in such a public way?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s bad…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Amae. Let’s hold hands.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, it’s not my hand that will connect, but Amae’s other hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, Kron held her hand, so Amae seemed quite surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, we’re swinging to and fro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… oh… Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron smiled and swung the hand connected to Amae back and forth like a cradle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was confused at first, but she began to swing herself to see if it was fun.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, let’s do it together!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? Me, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! Swinging~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae, who was pleased, swung my hand, which was holding hers, as well. Three of us walked while holding hands, with her sandwiched between me and Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, won’t someone say something about me doing this with the goddess the people worship?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, what? They’re being rude to the Goddess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They can’t be that familiar with our Goddess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That kid too!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That man was fighting Machio yesterday…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She’s Amae from the church, isn’t she? Was she such a laughing child?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… I think so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, just looking at that is somewhat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? At first, their eyes accused me of being a “rude guy”, but that disappeared in an instant, and on the contrary, more and more people started to look at us with warmth, or rather, a kind of ……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Warm and fluffy~”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s warm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, if we were walking around like this, we’d look like a group of close siblings…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong, rather it transcends that… as close as… family?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whoa whoa, Tre’ainar. You can’t say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m still 15.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Generally, it’s as if me and Kron are a married couple and Amae is like our daughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ignoring Tre’ainar’s silly jokes, the three of us made our way through the cozy town and headed for the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Earth! Let’s give Amae a swing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? Swing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, the two of us will lift Amae up like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, ah… like this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! And do this, swish swush!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From both sides, Kron and I pulled Amae’s arms and lifted her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae’s legs were floating in the air. With her legs flapping, she laughed excitedly at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kyahooooooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was shouting the loudest she’s ever shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufufu, is it fun? Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, are you in a good mood?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kyahooo! More, do more!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We walked while doing such a thing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uh huh, just get married.””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the people around us were talking and whispering about something, but it was a little embarrassing and uncomfortable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But after enduring the stares, we finally arrived at the dojo, and what was waiting for us was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, do your best… ka… ara?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What in the?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We showed up at the dojo, but there was no one on the first floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dumbbells, barbells, skipping ropes and other things, which some people seem to have been training with just a while ago, were scattered on the floor, but no one was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But soon from upstairs…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Uooooooooh!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whole building trembled with resounding voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is everyone up there?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Looks like it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was upstairs. But what’s going on if they’re all up there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So we went up the stairs…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing, that Miss.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah! Well, Tsukshi can’t land a solid hit at all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi is the third strongest person in the dojo after Mr. Machio and Bro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s more, she and Karui are working together! Karui’s non-stop unperceivable movements… is she seeing through it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not upstairs. It’s the ring on the third floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someone must be sparing today, just as me and Machio sparred yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the resounding cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we arrived on the third floor, the ring was surrounded by a lot of people, and on top of that, the ones who were fighting…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This… ah… Mortriage… those guys too…!?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of the ring, “seven men and women” were fighting… it seemed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage, Oratsuki, Mobner and Budeo, were kneeling, fainted or collapsed on the ring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, hah… Arcane True Zenith, Full Thrust! Seiya!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going all out, too! Magical Sprint!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui were attacking a woman with two-on-one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of them are standing upright with nonchalant faces…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I will capture you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She passed between them in an instant while maintaining her straight posture.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at the next moment, Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui had their hands and feet tied with a skipping rope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow!? H, how!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ge, ge!? Amazing! When did you tie them up!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two tied up people fell rolled around on the ring as they were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what it was… it felt nostalgic to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t even think about it, my body just moved naturally…… I could do this too…” [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz nodded expressionlessly, without one heavy breath, without a single bead of sweat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe she borrowed Elder Sis Tsukshi’s clothes, or rather, I saw Sadiz in half-sleeves and shorts for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her bare legs, thighs and crisp buttocks!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh, no, no! What’s this stimulation……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing! Six-on-one with no hands or feet!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ms. Sadiz, was it? So cool!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’d love to be like her…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Beautiful, cool, and strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From what I’ve heard, her housework in general is perfect and she’s a great cook!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, marry me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By all means… By all means, be my bride!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t try to get ahead of me! It’s me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys at the dojo were just as excited as I was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, regardless of male or female, was shouting their admiration for Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing… to think there was such a woman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What a …… hottie.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, I’m thrilled.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mwah! I want to be looked down on with those eyes and stepped on some more!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mortriage and the guys rolling in the ring also got up, with bitter smiles, blushes on their cheeks, saying kinky things…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing! Yes, Ms. Sadiz! To think I’ve been completely beaten! Can I call Big Sister Sadiz from now on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya~, amazing~! I mean, why are you so strong!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui, who lost, had glimmering eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz grabbed the hearts of many people in an instant while I was not around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, she’s amazing, Sadiz…… Hmm? Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watching the scene, I couldn’t help having complicated feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s nothing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was supposed to feel so warm and fluffy, but what was this feeling?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I decided to leave the third floor, where the excitement was still stirring, and continue my training, trying to dissipate something I didn’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am much obliged to you. I had over 4,000,000 unique accesses. It hasn’t been six months since I started, but aside from the pros and cons, I feel that it was read by a surprisingly large number of people. Thank you for the nakedness from the bottom of my heart.
