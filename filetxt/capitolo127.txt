<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was called a genius.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though she was just a kid, the four of us, me, the princess, Rebal, and Fu, were easily beaten by her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the time she was at the Academy, it was said that she would eventually become a World-class Warrior of the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, of course, there were a lot of guys who courted Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz. I had a new horse bought for me. The same bloodline as that magnificent Monday Silence Race Horse, would you like to come and see it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t run off! Hey, Sadiz, actually, I got tickets to the theater from my dad. They’re special seats. Would you like to go with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz. Sadiz may be the top girl and the top of the grade, but I’m the top boy. Why don’t we train together in order to reach greater heights?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How long has it been?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Sadiz was attending the academy, I ‘happened’ to pass by the academy’s gate and saw Sadiz, who was gathering a crowd of people around her as she left school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong, smart, beautiful and popular.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw that, I got impatient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are you guys doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one who knows Sadiz best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one who lives with her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one who’ll be with her forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was simply the jealousy of a kid. I was like that, but Sadiz replied expressionlessly to the boys around her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, but I have plans.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without showing any sign of thinking, she answered back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The men were dumbfounded. Clearly, there was no hope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a cold, arrogant attitude wouldn’t usually be appreciated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ms. Sadiz looks lovely today too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So cool, beautiful, and noble in her isolation.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What kind of person could win her heart?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It would have to be a high ranking Warrior… no, it must be Royalty from another country.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She has inherited the teachings of Hiro and Mamu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to call her sister already!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if I know I’ll be rejected, I’ll at least accept… just a love letter!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Women of the same gender who show admiration…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, she standoffish… but that’s fine~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, I’d love to have her as my wife…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t do that. You can’t have her.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve never asked to go on a date.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were rejected, and not taken seriously, but still, no man gave Sadiz a suspicious look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I peeked through the Academy gate, I realized once again that Sadiz was very popular.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I hung my head a little, Sadiz, who had noticed me, ran up from the other side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, is school over? Anyway, why are you here …um? Hmm~? Hmm~♪? Ufufufufu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She looked at me, strangely seemed to wonder why I was there, but Sadiz immediately grinned with a nasty smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what is it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Did you come to pick me up, by any chance, Little man?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Correct answer. But I flatly denied it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you’re wrong! After school, I thought I’d go on a little detour, and I happened to be at the Academy Street and just peeked a little bit at the future, so it’s not like I was wondering if Sadiz was with someone I didn’t know or anything like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was already talking too fast. Sadiz suppressed her expression and turned to face the other way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I understand… Li, little man… enough is enough. So, any more than that… t, too cute…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you muttering and laughing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I was being made fun of for being too transparent, so I sullenly bowed my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh… fo, forget it already. Sadiz dummy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… his angry face too… Hah~…… this is why I can’t have any shred of interest in boys my age…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to sulk and run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I could, Sadiz stopped laughing and bent down a little and reached out to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well then, Little man. Now that we met by chance, would you like to go home with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That alone made my cheeks burn, and I timidly held out my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…that‘s fine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I just couldn’t resist Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, going home in uniform like this with Little man, it’s pretty refreshing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, is it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We walked along the central street of the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave a short reply, but I was really nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time I walked alongside Sadiz in her Academy uniform, instead of her usual maid outfit, and I felt something different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, I tried to cover up my nervousness, I asked Sadiz something I was concerned about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… is popular, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Thankfully.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm. But…… i, is that okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, you were asked out on a date!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Looks like it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know, Sadiz, always studies, trains… helps with housework… and also has homework… it’s a lot. Don’t you want to go out on dates or play once in a while? Don’t you think about it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was always doing a lot for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But is it okay to always do that much for me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Doesn’t Sadiz want to have fun too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, I still don’t want to see Sadiz with other guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With such a complex feeling, I couldn’t be honest with her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Sadiz said to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’m also a woman, Little man. I want to go on a date with a boy too, or I should say, I’m going on a date, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprised, I turned around and looked up, and Sadiz had that nasty smile on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey? What’s wrong~? Little man. Look, you see, I’m popular as you know, right? I want to hold hands and go on a flirty date with a boy, and I actually have one in mind already.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? No way, eh? That…… eh…… not true, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not a lie~. That’s why I declined the invitation of my classmates. I already love that person, I love him so much that I can’t help it, so today is another day for a date, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was shocked. I thought I knew Sadiz better than anyone, so I almost cried because I wondered if there was a Sadiz that I didn’t know existed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the future, I’m going to marry Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought so, but I was trembling and almost in tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, way… where is he? Are you going on a date today? Who with?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked Sadiz, holding back my tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Sadiz, who was usually expressionless or grinning like an idiot, smiled at this moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right now, I’m on an after-school date with the boy I’m holding hands with.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that, I got very embarrassed, but I was happy and excited, and I didn’t really remember how we got home or what kind of conversation we had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But looking back, that’s a line she said because she treated me like a younger brother or a child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It always fueled my first love, and it had always dominated me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It must have been broken off after the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite that, even now I still think back on that moment, I still have a long way to go after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… what am I doing… don’t frivolously hold hands with a kid and a natural airheaded woman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little while ago, I was so carefree and fluffy that I felt ashamed of myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look at me! I’m getting stronger! I can’t get swayed like this! I’m going to win! I’ll win! No matter who it is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to become so strong that I won’t feel so feminine when I remember that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’ll win! I’ll win! I’ll win!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whoever’s the opponent is!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…… somehow… before the match… Hiro, Mamu, and that maid all had similar expressions when you said as much.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… there was no such thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so? Well, it matters not so long as such feelings give rise to an aggressive spirit.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, there is no one except me and Tre’ainar on the first floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar talked as I was hitting light strikes on the sandbag in front of the mirror.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, the day when my father and mother left their jobs and came back in a hurry when I opened a magic hole and collapsed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was angry at the situation that “nobody expected my victory”, and vowed to become stronger out of rebellious spirit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, things were completely different now, and I didn’t think I was the same as I was at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it might have looked so to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as if Tre’ainar understood my feelings…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, child. For these three months, as I previously said, ‘Improving basic skills’ using the equipment of the dojo. ‘Mastery of Magical Breathing’. This is the theme, and I intend to continue your training for that. I am considering various training menus so you do not get bored, but… there shall be a slight change in the schedule.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather than changing things, I suppose we shall add to the training themes in order to get stronger.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The training from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to improve my basic abilities, I will be doing jumping rope, muscle training for the upper body &amp;amp; lower body, training dedicated to the big toe, road work, shadow and sparring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the mastery of the Magical Breathing, yoga and other techniques being taught over a short period of time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this current situation, we will add another new theme.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It could be pretty tough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, strangely enough, I just felt like I would do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the new theme that Tre’ainar imposed was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the development of a Special Technique.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wh… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was dumbfounded by a slightly unexpected proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Great Demon Flicker, Great Demon Smash, Great Demon Corkscrew, the Counter Punches, the Breakthrough, the Great Demon Spiral are all techniques. However, they are originally my techniques. To put it abominably, you are simply using my skill as you are told. Well, tis still not a demerit yet…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, as I’m told… tte…… but now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis why you need to look to the future and create one. Whether or not it can be used in three months, it shall your own original technique… devise your Signature Move.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My Signature Move. I feel it’s been a long time since I heard that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And in the development of this Signature Move… tis up to you to decide what sort of special move to create.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow?! Eh … eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while proposing it himself, Tre’ainar declared a hands-off policy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help being puzzled by this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, you may seek my consultation. But from now on, while doing the same training as before, and while leading those pathetic men of the Wizarding School, come up with the image of your Special Technique in a corner of your mind. Imagine what you can do and what suits you. Then, create something you may claim as your own, something to be burned into the eyes those dullards, something that will leave the world breathless!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought he’d come here and make such a proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, I would have had a lot of fun just thinking about the Special Technique Name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now it’s different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Generally, I’d rather have Tre’ainar, who knows what’s right, tell me the answer…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis certainly quicker to have me come up with an idea that is right for the child, but … on occasion, something such as this also good. Tis a way for you to be you…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar’s smile looked more like a school teacher giving homework than a master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I didn’t get Tre’ainar’s intentions, but either way, I had to think as I was told.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, in order to devise a special move, the sooner you learn Magical Breathing the more you may expand your options. In fact, tis better to have you master it slowly, but I cannot say so. So, child. Truthfully, I am reluctant about having you do this in the growth period, but there is a way to learn Magical Breathing faster by combining it with Yoga.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The teacher-like expression receded in an instant, and this time, Tre’ainar showed the stern face of a master again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He asked me, as if to test my feelings and resolve, and when I nodded…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you are prepared… we shall ‘dry out by draining’… for a short time … I shall have you experience some hell.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The harsh training I had done so far started to look like a refreshing, sparkling sweat.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
