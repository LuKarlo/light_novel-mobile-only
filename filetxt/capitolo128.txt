 It’s only been a few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Draining. Does it drain moisture from the whole body by simply sweating and salivating?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t see how that’s training at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if it simply means not drinking water even if you’re thirsty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for me who has fought ninja warriors, an ogre, hoodlums and a mantis, it would be an easy task… easy task…… who was that optimistic idiot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraaaa!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s sloppy! Don’t make me hit you just to relieve stress, imagine your opponent!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oratski slammed his fist into the sandbag with all his might.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was supporting the sandbag from behind, and I felt the shock as I shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t want to shout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Mortriage! Mobner! We’re sparring, both of you at the same time, come on! Mobner, try harder to evade my left! Mortriage cast bit-class magic at me from mid-range.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Ou!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s new instructions to me: “Drain the water” or something like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many days since I started? You can count the number of days on one hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, what is it? What’s going on with my head and heart right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong, Mobner! It’s just a slowed down left handed flick! If you can’t handle this, you’re not worth talking to!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku~, a utsu, u, gu~ “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mortriage, next, thunder! No, come on! You can dexterously use various attributes! Instead of half-heartedly learning powerful magic, you should learn how to activate basic magic instantly in quick succession! Next, wind!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ts, 【Bit Wind】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know I shouldn’t be shouting, but I can’t help but get annoyed and raise my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m trying to avoid hitting these guys, but inside I’m pretty pissed off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell is that! Wha puh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No! You’re not quick enough! You can’t hit anyone with that, and even if you did, it wouldn’t hurt much! Get a moment’s step in and put your entire weight on it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someday, something ugly in me will scream out not only at these guys, but the whole area?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been spending the last few days holding it back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, hah~… right. That’s it. The rest is all muscle training. As I told you, while you’re in pairs and one is on the bench-press, the other will spot.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ou!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One thing that helped was that these guys were surprisingly obedient to what I say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If they had complained, saying “eh” or “let’s do something more interesting,” they might have gotten familiar with my flying fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, these guys are really trying to be strong, no matter what. That’s why they’re serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve learned that over the past few days, so I can’t do anything shameful, even if I’m the one teaching them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, I’m going for a run.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After accompanying these guys, it was time for my own training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From morning to evening, I tortured my body, from the evening until the night, I coached them, and at night, my training started again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s already dim outside, and the workers at the end of the day are on their way home, and in the lit shops are buzzing with excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Elder Sis Tsukshi… Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good work! Still training?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps they were the way home from shopping for dinner, Elder Sis Tsukshi and Sadiz were filling out shopping bags.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz still seemed awkward with me and dropped her gaze a little, but Elder Sis Tsukshi spoke to me regardless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We haven’t eaten together lately, have we? You’ve been coming home late, so the goddess and Amae seem a bit lonely?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae has been staying up late, saying she’ll wait until Earth comes home, but it looks like Earth doesn’t come home at all… is that okay~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past few days, we usually get up at the same time and eat at the same time, but my life has changed since I started draining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I get up earlier than usual and ran later than usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t we all eat together today? If so, we could invite Mortriage and others to have a get-together with Sadiz Big sister!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey hey, Elder Sis Tsukshi, that’s… you’re talking about the fun party for Mortriage and guys after they get stronger, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, but…I can barely wait…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At least, ‘that event’ will be done, or not, after the tournament is over. So I’m going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s not just about running. I also cut off my desires.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz seemed to sense that I was starting to build a wall here, and tried to talk to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew that, but I started running without responding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run through the town at night without looking back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Happy Birthday, José (senior)! The present is~ this・me――――――――”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? What the hell, whoa, I tripped on the floor, whooooaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, José!? Kyaaah, it’s still too soon… oh no, the ribbon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way?! The ribbon came off, m, my boobies!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Senior, th, that’s a precious spot for girls, don’t go fondling them!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sheesh, José’s such a perv!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See here, you’ll have to take responsibility for that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t care what other people around me are doing or how much fun they’re having.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m me. No matter what other people are doing, I’ll just go ahead without looking aside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… well then, shall we push on again?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh, let’s get started.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I arrived at the beach, before I started training at sea…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First… Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, breakthrough. Then, without doing anything, let the magic drip away and wait until the breakthrough expires.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haa~, ze, hah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『All right, the magic is spent.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past few days, it wasn’t just the draining of water from my body that was tough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When training, Tre’ainar’s instruction was to train with “zero magical power”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is it difficult?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, not at all. It’s just, my clothes are soaked with sweat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahaha, is that so? The fact that you perspire means we can still squeeze out more. Go! Daaaaaaash!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When your magic power drops to zero, you suddenly feel a sense of fatigue in your body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I run, I’m short of breath and exhausted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially when I’m slowly losing strength due to the draining process, and then there’s this Magical Zero-Start Training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it’s been a few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only a few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s intense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Deee yarayarayarayarayarayarayarayarayarayarayara!!!! Oyaraaaaaaaah!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he made me run like a carriage horse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past few days, the amount of running has tripled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To gain strength? There should be other training to improve physical strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I’m sure Tre’ainar knew that. But he single-mindedly drove me to run.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Training from the morning, magic emptied, and then I just kept on dashing on this sandy beach that was tripping me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Zee, ha, zee…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not pause during the interval! Do your sit-ups!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, ts, nuh, ku”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『End of interval! Dash!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuuuuuuooooooooooohhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are going a little slow, are you not? What, is that it? Are you going to cut corners and rest?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, damn you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Look at that. You still have some energy to spare! A spoiled twit raised on a full stomach. You will have to part with that!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuuoooooooooh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So harsh! I mean, I needed water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I may desperately want to swallow my saliva and even lick this flowing sweat now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it? Why? Why am I doing this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I’m getting tired of even thinking about it, gradually transcending frustration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, you grow weaker. However, humans have always been lackadaisical. During the war, there were those who have endured for days without water.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Zee, hah, zee, ha…… hyuu… khyuu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So, how is it? Do you feel anything in your body?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… No…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. Then, go run some more.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha!? ………… Osu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My thighs were heavy. My calf was screaming to be pulled. What is this general feeling of emptiness?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I’m training, I don’t feel like I’m getting stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So far, the training methods that Tre’ainar has taught me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of them made me realize that “If you continue to do this, you will definitely get stronger”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, this is different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Emptied magical power recovers over time. Tis because over time, the magic holes gradually take in the magic from the air. Everyone does this unconsciously. You should be able to feel this gradual intake. If you grasp that sensation, become aware of it yourself, and know what it feels like to take in magical power… you will be able to master ‘Magic Breathing’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The last few days of training have only made me feel weaker and weaker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I’m getting weaker now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I carry on like this, I just feel like I’m going to collapse eventually.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, the sensation as the magic in the air being taken in through the magic hole is truly subtle. Tis too miniscule to be felt by the senses of an ordinary creature. In order to sense it, it is necessary to bare the nerves and have a keen sense sharpened to the limit…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know I’m going to collapse. But I have no choice but to run.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I have now is my mental strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if this will make me stronger or not, but is all for the sake of getting stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s what I believe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This story is fiction. There is a possibility that you cannot learn the Magical Breathing even if you drain. It is dangerous if you do not do it under proper guidance. Also, “I drained, but I couldn’t learn the Magical Breathing, the author should take responsibility, shave your hair!” Even if this is said, please understand that the author cannot shave his hair.
