 Tis been days innumerable by counting with both hands, and the child has grown quite thin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boy, who was raised without any inconvenience, began to display sunken cheekbones, dried skin, and even dark circles forming around his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Tre’ainar…again, it’s morning already, right? Let’s, go for a run.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Already, he has reached the point near the limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The time to get up in the morning steadily becomes earlier. Tis not due to enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He simply cannot fall into a deep sleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Break… through”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a patient, his would be a serious case. However, he still runs after emptying his magical power with a breakthrough so as to keep to his word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the breakthrough itself puts a strain on the body, the child is doing it indifferently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…sshi…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once ready, he runs straight out to the beach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The time of day is dark enough to be midnight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child runs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although the time has fallen tremendously, the child is still giving his all in his current condition without cutting corners.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, ze, hah, ze, zee …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To put it bluntly, such activity where one just single-mindedly sweats is not training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis complete overwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As such, the training is counterproductive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, for young children, this draining is not something that should be performed from the standpoint of an instructor, I am not inclined to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would much rather take the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, with the next three months put into consideration, this is necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as long as the child himself believes in it, I cannot afford to hesitate in giving my instruction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would be harsh to allow a young, well-bred boy to relinquish his greed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『All right, do the shadow while carving the steps in detail. Begin!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ‘su…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even at the best of times, he would be unable to skillfully perform the steps on the sandy beach. His legs are tangled and he is unable to keep to a rhythm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, he trips on his own feet and falls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, nuoh … hah, hah … Damn it! Hah, hah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a situation where his body cannot move as well as he imagines, the child bites his dry lips, bleeds, and slams the sandy beach in frustration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yet……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you want to rest?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~!? Let’s… go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he collapses, even as he weakens, he will still stand back up immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When it comes to this point, it can be said to be an obsession already beyond tenacity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, only one thing puzzled me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He has fallen into an extreme state, the child has also become irritable, and his spirit is gradually collapsing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even though he fell into this situation, he complains, but he never shows weakness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, it would not be strange to utter, “no more”, “I can’t do it “, and “I want to stop”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, he is silently doing what he ought to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, u… uooaaaaaaaaaahh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such desperation is not founded merely on self-reflection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis not simply the desire for strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Water, water, drink water, damn, I’m going crazy! I don’t know what’s going on! Damn it, sh*t!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can feel the child’s inner cries as he shadows himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he can drink, for the child that much is true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly I am by his side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shall reprimand him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even though I can exchange words with the child, I cannot directly touch him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cannot sacrifice my wellbeing for his, nor can I strike him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Should the child break his word and tries to drink water, I cannot stop him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child does not break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you losing heart?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even when I ask with sarcasm, the child will always reply.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not, to, this, much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though I believe “In this way, the child can learn Magical Breathing in a short period of time”, I do not have much “experience” in teaching disciples by actually draining water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I thought this is what becomes of the person who drains water day in and day out right before my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I can comprehend the cry of the child’s heart, at this point, I may be forced to unknowingly break the promise regardless of the child’s will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child does not break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I can’t give in… I’m already at my limit, it’s hard, it hurts, I’m dying, but… I’m not going to say it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that was the moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This guy thought I could do it, so he imposed it… then I’ll do it…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can feel it. The child’s inner cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The people of the Imperial City, my father, my mother, Sadiz… didn’t expect it from me… no one was looking at me…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this point, it must have slipped his mind that I can understand the voice in his mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, perhaps he is screaming unconsciously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But… but now! For the first time, I’ve got someone who looks at me… and now I’ve imposed on him to believe that I can do it… How can I betray that expectation ……?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh…… goodness…… this dullard…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I, don’t want to be a disappointment to this guy alone! Just to him, I don’t want to betray him!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During the Graduation match, I called out the child’s name but once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pushed out the child’s back and called the name “Earth Lagann” as a testimony that he is recognized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I called it only once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, that one instance must have stayed with the child forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Really. In that case, continue.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, su.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shall pretend not to have heard the child’s heartfelt cries?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, this foolish disciple…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, that one… Kron saw through that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I think what Earth really wants is not just strength, but something more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, what the child wants. I know what it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child himself is unaware. No, he may have forgotten what he wants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The root of what you want, child, has not changed since we first met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You want to be recognized as “Earth Lagann”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis not to be praised. You want someone to recognize your existence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, getting stronger is but a means to an end, not the end-all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were other ways to earn recognition for something beyond your father in different fields.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you chose this path.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I know too. No matter how harsh you appear on the surface, you still want to show yourself to that maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not as the boy who is the Hero’s son, but as Earth Lagann. As a man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, you are slowing down a little, are you not? What is wrong! You can always quit anytime you want!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’ll get it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know what you want, and that is why I will not grant it to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will no longer refer to you as “Earth Lagann”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know what you want, but if I give it to you, its value will diminish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your goal now is neither here nor in three months. Tis much further ahead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cannot give you hope so easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, being recognized by others happens naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If those who do not know what you want come to recognize you naturally, tis of precious value.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I will say no more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I will be watching … you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, ze, hah … eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I have not said a thing. You are lacking concentration! Focus more!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, su”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I shall watch to the very end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of giving you the words you want, I shall keep looking at you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… geez, I heard that… well, maybe it’s okay to pretend I didn’t hear it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Nu?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Well… Thank you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 tsu, t, tis why I said that your mind is transparent to me.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
