 ”…… A-Are you serious? You…… train me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well… I may have lost my composure earlier, but… I suppose I have free time, and it might amuse me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but the Great Demon King raising the son of a hero…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather splendid! Once Hiro’s child becomes tainted! Huhahahahaha, to behold the look of despair on his face!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first he was all sorts of furious and declared that he would train me, but now he has an awful smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because he thought it would be interesting, or because he was sealed for so long, but apparently he had no intention of withdrawing his word to train me anyway, I just can’t tell what his true intentions are.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was also carried along by the momentum, and was forced to buy various things that he said are necessary for training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… All this ……such a pain…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oii! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We only have two months, right? That’s about it, and I don’t think it’s going to be any good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis dependent upon your feelings on the matter. Especially hatchlings such as yourself, the early stages of your growth are a simple matter.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… I’m in trouble because I’m not growing fast enough…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don’t know why, I’m just doing what I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only in the academy, but also with Sadiz helping me study and seeing to my training herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as if to reject such notions, I am taken down by that prodigy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from my efforts bearing fruit, I’m disappointed that I’m ‘the son of the hero’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I gradually felt like an idiot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. You lack proper motivation. Tends to happen when you feel far away from your goal and become depressed, or when you know not your own path. I would like to ask if I may, what are your plans and goals for the future? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In your future, what do you desire to become and what do you wish to accomplish? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was like an adult asking a child about his dreams for the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when asked again, I couldn’t find the right words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Co, come on… even if you ask me that…… for the time being, I’m going to be an Imperial Knight, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that something you decided for yourself? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… No, no……I don’t know… b, but… it’s just…… everyone thinks I’m going to be…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… then this is where to start…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King exhaled a sigh as he said so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you lack a clear goal, an image of your future, how would you know what you train for?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To not lose to the princess or to live up to the expectations of others… Well, that may be the case, but as sources for motivation they are feeble.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t expect the Demon King would ask about my path or my future. Even my motivation, as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I certainly don’t believe I want to be a warrior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a kid, I might have thought that I wanted to be like my father, but now I don’t think that’s the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if you say so…… to suddenly ask me…… I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I suppose…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never thought deeply about it before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I said that there was no way I could understand even if I was suddenly asked, Demon King nodded and then whispered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Right, then let us do this. Putting aside the future for another time, and first of all, we will set a clear goal and a time frame close at hand. The training will be for that purpose.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Close……? That’s to get a win over the princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Simply put, tis your victory at the [Graduation Commemorative Match] in two months time.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? …… So sudden…… How did it come to that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said something pretty difficult as a clear goal to give to me, as I’m a bit flustered about my future and my goals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there might be a point where [Beat the Princess = Championship], but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And the next thing we need is an area to drive motivation for training.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Motivation… Do I need it? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Naturally. Rather than just being told to do so, tis more effective to possess the will to devote yourself to training. So, is there anything that would motivate you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know what he’s trying to say. But if I knew that, it would be the least of my worries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I don’t have that kind of motivation, so I’ve been stagnant lately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apart from that, I don’t have any great reason to become an imperial warrior, and pursue peace in the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To find motivation, rather than abstract notions such as justice or peace, tis better to have something impure, is it not?” 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Impure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time. I doubted my ears at the suggestion of the Great Demon King, who sees through my inner feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. Because a person cannot maintain a clean and pure heart forever. Even more so, tis rare for one to remain motivated by trivial and noble things forever. I know the ugliness and desires of humans better than you do.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes, that’s right… Is that what you’re talking about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As such, what do you desire, be it wealth, or the promise of reward such as having your father treat you to a meal if you win, anything will do?? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s better to be impure than for a noble reason. I hadn’t thought about it, but is that how it works?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea, but the problem is that I don’t want to eat with my father and am not hurting for money either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmmm… Impure motivation, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nothing came to mind either, and I’m still groaning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Little man, welcome home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I arrived at the mansion, and Sadiz, who was cleaning the garden in front of the entrance, greeted me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She immediately squinted at what I had in my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, you’re free to stop by and shop, but… what is all this? That is. It seems you have bought a lot, but what do you intend to do that you would buy a ‘Ladder’? That bag is… sewing needles? No, ‘acupuncture’? Either way, we have all this in the mansion, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, there was a ladder among what Demon King had me buy because it was needed for training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As she said there was also one in the mansion, but I should have a personal one “for training”, so I bought it for some reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I don’t know what I’m going to use it for right now, but for the time being…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-Well, just a little-”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Trying to take a peek at me in the bath, are we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course not! I’ll use it for a bit of training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who sometimes sees to my training, tilts her head not knowing of what use the ladder will be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh right. Oops, yes…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About my meals from today… can I see the menu schedule?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this was also an order from the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said that meals are one way to increase the effectiveness of training, and those menus for morning, noon, and evening will be thorough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I’ve never made such a request to Sadiz before, so she’s surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind, but… what’s going on? Little man. You’ve never been bothered by such a thing before, and have always said that what I made was so delicious that you wanted me as a bride. And why is it that you’ve always been depressed when I’ve ignored your comments?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-Well… that too…… anyway, it’s for the sake of winning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s all for the purpose of winning the [Graduation Commemorative Match] in two months…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m still not sure I’m in the mood to go that far… I guess I’m not motivated enough when I think that way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean you’re going to win, little man? What happened? If you have any problems, I’ll not bully you today, so I’ll give you a consultation. If it’s a ridiculous reason, you’ll be teased.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I love Sadiz who’s worried about me, she’s cute… Motivation…… Impure…… Hmm!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I came up with a dumb idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, what is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In two months… I have the [Graduation Commemorative Match].”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I know. I’ll be cheering for you that day.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’ll get mad at me, but I’m trying…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I do it… the tournament…… if I can win the championship…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all…just once…… I want to go on a date Sadiz in casual clothes once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Yu, eh!? L-Little Man…? N-Now, how? Is it a hallucination? Is little man… himself…… win?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’d be surprised. I’m not very motivated these days and that I’ve given up a lot, Sadiz knows enough to understand all this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my mouth, due to the word “win” that I have never uttered before, Sadiz is unusually confused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I… Say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, if I win the tournament…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, I’m getting nervous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. But Sadiz knows how I feel, and… it’s not like we’re going to get married, but first of all, we go on a date. That’s it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it’s just that, Sadiz might do it, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dating…… Walking hand in hand… say ‘aah’ for a bite… Hugging, kissing… then, after that, then, depending on the atmosphere… at night…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let me feel your boobs!” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeh!? …… Aaaah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Un…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sh*t,Oh no?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no, no, it’s not, Sadiz! J-Just now, I …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The delusion that I envisioned in my heart came out to my mouth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Sadiz is very angry and with her smile. Also, the Demon King might have said “Hoh” too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Little man…… Ufufufufu, Hohohohoho, it was too horrible a joke that I shouldn’t laugh, and yet I’m laughing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, haha…I- I’m sorry. My mistake…… Fo…… Forget it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”……………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m a dumbass! It’s different…… with Sadiz I want… more, I mean pure love.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”………………… I see. Alright.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”……… Eeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No!? Eh?! To?! Eeh!? Eh!? J, just now, Sadiz…… Eh?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To be frank, it’s a request someone lower than sh*t would make, and should be reported to the Master as a matter of sexual harassment… but… Little man has recklessly declared victory…… for a moment my heart was shaken.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Sadiz faces me with a serious expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, it’s absolutely a secret from the Master, but… If You Can Win Little man, then! Then you can play with the puppies all day!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My goodness… the Princess and others will aim to prove the Empire’s military prestige to the Imperial People and other countries by winning this tournament, it is considered noble and honorable to show everyone that they will lead the future era, but for Little man its tits…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did I hear her wrong…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although she’s looking at me with cold eyes like I’m a worm or less, she’ll let me feel her up. Not just that, but free for a whole day!? Kept secret from father!? If I win the championship, seriously, eh, can I do as I like with her boobs!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you staring at? You’re winning the championship, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, looking a little embarrassed, Sadiz finishes cleaning and returns to the house.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Leaving me alone in front of the entrance…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh…UUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh now I’m motivaaaaaaaaaaaaated! I never imagined any of this!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I win… If I win the championship, a chance at Sadiz’s boobs depends on whether I win or not!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Pure love? What’s that? No idea! Is the love for her boobs not enough?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… W, well…… as suggested tis better for your aim to be impure.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King whispers in satisfaction, not that I cared about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon King! No … Tre’ainar! I … I’ll definitely win! So train me! I’ll do as you say! So…… Please, Osu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to show courtesy to Tre’ainar who I’m asking for guidance from now on, I bowed for the first time after correcting my posture.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Hero’s child bows to the Great Demon King, irrelevant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From now on, we’re in a relationship between a master and a disciple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar sighs as if a little concerned…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『U, uh huh, let us proceed! Then, in two months time, you will win the championship, and the bosoms!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I swore to my soul that I would achieve it even with my life on the line.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was the fourth place overall for three days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the drill still continues to turn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once it rotates, it moves forward a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for your support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m getting excited!
