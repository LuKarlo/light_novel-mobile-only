<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stood on the empty beach, looking out at the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was still something left of my body, even though it was as dry as skin and bones.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could easily feel the throbbing of my heart, the creaking of muscles as I move, and even the circulation of the blood in my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the midst of all this, I felt a slight sense of something being taken into my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A small amount of energy was entering my body as if taking in air through the many tiny holes in the whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feel the magic power as it is taken in, and know where it comes from. The exact positions of every one of your magic holes! Tis the ingress point of magic power! The magic hole is usually just an open hole, and magic power seeps in naturally. Do not simply keep them open, control them as if breathing in.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understand. My whole body, sharpened to the limit, could now sense even the sound of a distant drop of water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And my concentration, which had been heightened to this point by jumping rope and yoga, lured me to the bottom of the deep sea of consciousness, which was distracted as a consequence for the draining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had been so desperate for water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so crazy with an urge to kill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was hard, painful, and I felt like I was slogging through a hell with no end in sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now my body and mind were calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The days of hellish training, in which I couldn’t feel myself getting stronger, now made me feel a certain sense of achievement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This feeling was irresistible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason I felt this way was because of my master, who believed in me… and…… whatever the form, his presence was also there after all… I have mixed feelings. However, it’s a wonder that my head and heart were as clear and fresh as they’ve ever been.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Breakthrough”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now then, keep the breakthrough as it is! Magic power is released by being in a breakthrough state. Concurrently, control the magic holes and take in the magic power in the air. Release, take in, release, take in, repeat this in succession and circulate! That is the essential sensation to mastering Magical Breathing!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not ego. I can do anything right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That feeling fills me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the hell I’ve been through so far has become like my spine, my confidence even.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… This way…… then do… that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, that feeling! And you never forget the feeling once learned! You stood up and began walking today, just as a child learns to stand up and walk!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Started walking? For me, right now, it felt like skipping stairs as I ran up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The breakthrough, which would usually have already run out of time by now, has not expired yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, so long as I’m awake, I could carry on like this as much as I want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu, Fufufufu, Fuhahahahahahahahahaha!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The laugh was exactly like the Demon King’s hearty cackle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar spread his arms…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Welcome, child. To a plane in history that no one has yet reached, other than me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He welcomed me to step into a world known only to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my point of view, that was the greatest compliment I could have received.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『How do you fare?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’d like to try it out right away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu, such an impatient fellow. But…… that can wait a little longer. First of all, rest a little and get some fluids and nourishment.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Even though my heart and head have been refreshed in this way, I myself am still undead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I get back to normal… I mean, even now, what happens to me when I get back to my good form?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, quite a level up…… well, of course, as I’m thinking about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, here we go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You deserve praise for learning Magic Breathing, but do not ge―――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t get too carried away, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Mu… uh? Tis so…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To you, I’m still just a kid who started walking, right? I can’t run yet, I shouldn’t get carried away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, while teaching me Magical Breathing, Tre’ainar also said…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Your bout with Toulowe, to offer such an earnest challenge without using the breakthrough and win. An easy victory in the commemorative match was right before you, you put on a conceited display to the opponent to the tune of his futility, and yet are unwilling to use the power you have acquired indiscriminately. Today’s exchange with the Wizarding School small fry is evidence of this. You have a mind to aim for higher levels. That is why I guide you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In short, it means to not let the power you have acquired get to your head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not that kind of person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, though I followed Tre’ainar’s lead, then learned Magical Breathing, there’s still more to come.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the kind of attitude you want, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I would like to go back… to the church… so…… come on out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh!?”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufu, with the child’s senses as they are, naturally you noticed them, did you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ones at my back hiding behind a tree on the beach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara~, we’ve been found out~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Pardon me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, there were three of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth was acting strange recently… it was a terrible figure, and I was too afraid to call out… but now, Earth’s appearance has changed, his eyes have returned to the original Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron was smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… are you…… okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae, who was completely frightened by my recent appearance, hesitantly looked at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A water bottle was held in her hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz bowed her head with an apologetic look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that all three of them were following me because they were worried about me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know what you’ve been aiming for lately, but I won’t ask you. Looking at you now, I know it was necessary for you. I understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can you just tell me one thing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as she saw that I was already fine, Kron, who had been watching me from a distance, asked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just now… who were you talking to?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, the three people heard me and Tre’ainar having a conversation as they were hiding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no one could see Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would have sounded like nothing but my monologue, and I didn’t say anything too unnatural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Kron seemed to have sensed that I was talking to “someone”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I thought, she is sharp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… God…… or something like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey Oi…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, we can’t tell Kron everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I tried to mislead her so that she would have taken it as a joke, but Kron smiled and didn’t ask any more questions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…can I have …… that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, uah … uh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was hiding behind Kron, fidgeting. I pointed to the water bottle that Amae had and asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Amae gave a little nod and held out the water bottle to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how long it’s been there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the water in the water bottle felt somewhat warm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou~, impressive. Tis not cold water, plain warm water. Suddenly drinking cold water immediately after the extreme draining would break your body.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, is that the case? That’s……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You went to the trouble of bringing me a warm one?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I didn’t know that, so there’s no way Amae would know that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That would be……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~… she gave me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Amae pointed to Sadiz, who was next to her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see…… Sadiz’s wisdom…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, but…… you went out of your way to bring it, didn’t you? Thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, I stroked Amae’s head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time in a long time, so Amae trembled for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, while being stroked, Amae’s tear glands gradually loosened…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was clinging to my leg.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… after I rest a little… I’ll play with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’ll have a meal together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Amae clung to me and wouldn’t let go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a wry smile, I brought the warm water Amae gave me to my mouth and slowly sipped it in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not gulp it all down, understand? Let it soak into your body little by little.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suppressed my desire to drink all at once, and life gradually returned to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah. So good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… hah~…… I’m glad I’m alive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Amae didn’t cry first, or if there weren’t any women here in the first place, I might have shed tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how emotionally moved I was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It brought me back to life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sense of being alive has revived.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Revived. Next, I’ll take some rest, eat a meal, and restart from there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, putting that aside…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? …… Earth……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… you, calling me Earth, is great, but weird… well, that’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, let’s go back to church while ignoring it … it can’t be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When your memory returns, say it again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? That’s…… of course, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At that time, I won’t run away either. To you… now that you’re here, there’s something I want to tell you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as we’ve both been through this and I’ve overcome it, one thing has become clear to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s something I need to do before I finish the tournament and go out into the world again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now that we’ve come this far… we’ll have to settle things before I go out to the world.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Se… ttle?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, settle it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I ran away without doing that, things turned out this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why it’s necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why we need a resolution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, until then… hey, let’s go home, Amae. I’m hungry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! Go! Eat! Goooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s all I wanted to say to Sadiz, whether she had her memories or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Sadiz wouldn’t know what it means now, but I still said it anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I said what I had to say, and feeling refreshed, I was taken back to the church by Amae.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
