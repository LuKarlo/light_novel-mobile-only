 My body, which had been drained and dried out, was now back to normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My exhausted body and mind have completely recovered with a sense of accomplishment having mastered Magical Breathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At length, you have gotten accustomed to it. In Vier, you have almost mastered the combination of Magical Breathing and Breakthrough.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I’m surprised myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now that you have come this far, all that remains is … the ‘Special Technique’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Also, you’ll come to me in Vier tonight, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past few days, I’ve been able to do Vier training, which was mentally impossible during the draining period, as before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In it, I was trying to work on not only the Magical Breathing that I had just learned, but also my special technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that wasn’t all. There’s also…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… and Tre’ainar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Apart from the special technique… I have something I want you to teach me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, from tonight, I’ll need you to accompany me a bit more.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I became even greedier after having gone through hell and gained power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t sleep at night during the draining period, so I always wanted the morning to come early, but now I think the mornings came too early.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara, Earth. How do you do? You’re back to your old self, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the morning, Kron greeted me with a gentle smile as I showed up at the church dining hall as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui, also beckoned me with a relieved expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, are you okay? Your sis was really worried, you know!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya, I was really scared that big brother got weird, but now I’m relieved!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After the draining period, I gradually started to move according to the original time schedule.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No more roadwork in pitch-black hours, almost in the middle of the night, like I did during the draining period.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And today I was able to show up at the same time as the sisters of the church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no problem now. Thanks for your concern.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Elder Sis Tsukshi. Mr. Machio… I can beat him, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from worrying about it now, things were not the same as before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi seemed surprised at my confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? …… Good…… Morning”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave her a light greeting as she glanced at me while trying not to drop her gaze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz bowed her head, bewildered as her shoulders were shaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s clear that she still didn’t understand what I meant by “settle it” yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s fine now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So there’s no need to force things to turn sour now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Simply, just that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if we can’t interact like we used to, there’s no need to put up a wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother! She is still sleeping in bed, but play with Amae when she wakes up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Will do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was frustrated and impatient, but I was able to do one thing I couldn’t before, and I went through hell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That fact may have given me some leeway in my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It seems thou has made quite the accomplishment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ja… no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This draining period. Jamdi’el, who didn’t exchange a word, appeared in the dining hall and smiled in a somewhat good mood as she silently looked on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… I’ve worried you too, ‘High Priestess’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. That sounds quite condescending. But…… somewhat, more than before… what did thou do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, look forward to it at the upcoming tournament.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I confidently responded to Jamdi’el’s smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don’t mention that I just learned Magic Breathing and wasn’t conceited about surpassing Jamdi’el at this point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, knowing the power of my opponent, I was still able to face her in this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Jamdi’el didn’t seem offended by my attitude, but rather had a happy expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Very well, Show me! I’ve left thou to thy own devices, as thou wished, and I want to see the end of thy path.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. I’ll show you. You, too. And also…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the people of this country, to my master, to Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, incidentally, them as well…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, we’re here! You’re going to start working together with us again today!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Today is a school holiday, so we’re a little early, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuah~… sleepy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed the Wizarding school was closed today, and the Mortriage crew came early in the morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They raised their voices and called out to me in front of the church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right! I’m coming! Then I’m going for a little run. I’ll just grab some fruit, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, go for it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took only one apple from the dining hall table, took a bite and went outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, guys.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A crisp morning. Refreshing air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, road work was best at a time like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. Are you all right now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, no matter what you think, you were obviously acting strange for a while now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. You were so worn out and withered… but, are you okay now? You didn’t get sick or anything, did you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m fine”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then why were you doing that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that these guys were worried too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, of course they were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was accompanying them in training in that state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait! wai, wai, waaaaiitt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the clatter and the rumbling of someone panicking echoed through the church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, she was still sleepy, but woke up to the voices of the Mortriage crew and rushed down in a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Amae. At first, I went on road work with Amae on my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, during the drainage period, she was too scared of me to follow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Aren’t you still sleepy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’mーgoーing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I’m back to normal, it looks like she’ll be coming along again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Then, let’s go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! Un, shoulders!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay okay”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bent a little so that Amae could easily get on, and she jumped up and down with joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big sister! Big sister!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, yes, water bottle, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Amae called to Elder Sis Tsukshi as she climbed on my shoulder, and as if she knew it, Elder Sis Tsukshi handed Amae a water bottle large enough to hang on her shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I praised her for giving me a water bottle at the end of my draining the other day, so she said, “I’m all set,” as if she were in charge of the water bottle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That will increase my load, but I won’t say anything about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go! Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here we go, boys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was like we were a team.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The five of us, along with a young girl who looked like a chaperone, ran through the city in the morning, heading for the ocean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re all back to normal now, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? What are you saying, I’m always myself!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha? You looked sick and messed up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Apparently, yes. But for that time, I was able to sharpen up a lot of things and nurture what was within me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What did you nurture?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fighting spirit.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fighting spirit? What does that mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In road work with these guys, I’m in a handicap with Amae on my shoulders and weights on both hands and feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, these guys got tired before I did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But after a while, they were able to keep up with me for some time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, from here on, the dashes and shadows made them talk less and less, but even so, I could see that they were steadily improving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The roadwork from the city to the sea was the warm-up of warm-ups.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was time to start torturing my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on out, we won’t be able to chat as nonchalantly as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, before that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, about that José bastard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For them, he was the existence that gave them some sort of motivation in their life and their student life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, because of his presence, these guys also decided to become stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, the man named José might be both a wall and a goal for these guys, so to speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure, you’re getting stronger. But still, it’s impossible to say that you can surpass José right away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh!? But, Earth, that… I know it’s not easy, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. You may not be able to do it right away. But in the days to come, and over time, that will change… but…… before that…… the tournament will come.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So I want to ask you guys something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was confirmation to these guys, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll be participating in the upcoming tournament. And I’m going to win. In other words, if that José comes out, I will fight José at some point. And I’ll beat him up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a certainty that José will also be in the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s also a challenge for me to win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, I’m going to knock out José, who they’re chasing with gritted teeth, in public.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that a good thing or a bad thing for these guys?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you witness it… then what will happen to you? Will you feel refreshed? Or will you lose motivation? You’re gritting your teeth, so one day you’ll want to beat the guy with your own hands, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Mortriage crew seemed bewildered by my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But do you mind if I beat him up first?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wouldn’t they lose their goals if I messed up José, who they were desperately trying to overcome?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we’ve only known each other for a short time, they’re the ones who have been running behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted to make sure, because I felt that our relationship wasn’t so shallow that I could say “I don’t care about that”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, surprisingly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re not working hard just to get back at José…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Budeo who answered my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was always first to whine and get worn out … but for some reason he participates in training every day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to change myself… that’s why… so, yeah… it’s hard, but I want to be stronger. So…… even if Earth blows José away, I won’t stop there… no, it might slack off a little, but… I’ll keep going…… it’ll be tough, but… yes, I’m going to try a little more! Little Amae will support me… I want to show the sisters of the church my cool side.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Budeo’s own answer, though not completely assertive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, rather than being told “I will do my best even if José is defeated”, this felt more like Budeo’s true heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mortriage also chuckled…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If José was knocked down in front of me and that made me lose motivation… it’d be like we were still stuck at the back of the school building.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Generally, even you, though you were in that sickly state, were working very hard… we can’t just end up accomplishing nothing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I want to beat José, too. But most of all… I want to change myself…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys have been training for a while now. And it seems that they have sensed something from my training during the draining period.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So there is no problem with defeating José.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I received the answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lend me the water bottle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I received the water bottle from Amae and gave it to Mortriage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here you go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Take turns drinking.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah, erm… ng… right, Oratski.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, sure… nng… Mobner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, thank you. Puha~… Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ngokyu, ngokyu. …… Pu-~ …… I drank it, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, then I’ll be the last one… Pu-hah~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I passed the water bottle to Mortriage, Oratski, Mobner, and Budeo and drank it, and finally it was back in my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I also put my mouth on the water bottle I received and drank it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth? What the hell…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve met the guy, went through a lot of things along the way, and I’m kind of pissed off at this José bastard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t feel like bullying the weak, but I’m not so soft-hearted that I’ll just sit back and let it go peacefully when it’s okay to openly punch someone I’m really pissed off at. So I’ll hit him. But I’ll also put your feelings in my fist.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, since I’m going to beat José, I have to at least send their feelings through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We sweated together like this and we sipped the same water.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I turned over the empty water bottle after drinking it as I was talking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… you…… have you changed a little in the last few weeks?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahaha, well, I guess I’m a little stronger, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing my words, the four smiled mirthfully at the same time, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Hmm? Or rather, we’re going to perform dashes and shadows on the sandy beach from now on, and you drank up the water, what do we do?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………… Ah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaaah”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””What the heck are you doing?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that went well myself, but it was a fail damn it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mmmmm! Amae didn’t drink any!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dummy! Gusu, Amae is the only one left out… gusu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae cried and angrily pulled my hair in protest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, she was upset that she was the only one who didn’t get to drink, that she was left out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth, what have you done!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sheesh, that posed look, I never…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, really!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! You shouldn’t make Amae cry!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeii, shut it! Humans can live without drinking water for a few weeks if they feel like it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””You looked like you were on the verge of dying!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wonder what it is. I feel bad for Amae, but we were laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, no water today! Follow me expecting to die! Dash!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, I’m already spent! Come on, guys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Definitely, I’ll do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, what’s going to happen…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’ll, be troubled if it gets that difficult~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was a fulfilling and enjoyable time that I couldn’t taste during the draining period.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the more fulfilling and enjoyable the time, the faster the time seems to go by.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, when I came to this country, I felt that the three months before the tournament would be long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, before I knew it, the tournament was just around the corner―――――
