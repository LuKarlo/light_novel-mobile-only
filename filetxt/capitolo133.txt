<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My end goal was not to win the tournament, but to go further beyond.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, as long as winning the tournament was my current goal, I set my sights on it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A week before the tournament, I focused on relaxing to get myself in the best physical and mental condition possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the morning greeted me, I slept well, not having any trouble sleeping due to nervousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… it’s finally here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no sense of discomfort in my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a warrior’s tremor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This feeling was the same one I had before the Commemorative Match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come to think of it, my match… in the end, what happened after I left? Was it canceled? Well, no matter, this time… I will go all the way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the Commemorative Match, due to the intrusion of my mother and father and my running from home occurring back to back, and I wasn’t able to compete until the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time I will give it my all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Full of confidence, are you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I can’t let my guard down, and I won’t underestimate my opponents. It’s about time I had at least one title to my name.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this was a checkpoint. But still, I want victory now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve done a lot of things since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’ve never been the ‘best’ at anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not in swordsmanship, magic, grades, piano recitals, painting contests, and so on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I have never been crowned the winner or gotten first place, losing to the Princess, Rebal and Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I want it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… hey, little lady, shouldn’t you wake up soon?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~… un? …… hafu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, good morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before getting up… I wake up the girl sleeping in my bed clinging to my chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The young lady had the audacity to sneak into my bed in the middle of the night and went to sleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that my senses have been sharpened, I knew what was going on, but I allowed it with an open mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then she yawned once, rubbing her sleepy eyes, and looked at me with her eyes fluttering…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… u… ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly embarrassed, her face blushed red as she opened both eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, what’s wrong~? Hmm~? Hmm~? Hmm~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, ah, ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why did you sneak into my bed~? Hey, Amae. Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She turned her head to the side with her lips pouting as she poked and prodded with her left and right index fingers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I guess she was lonely or something like that, but it’s interesting, so let’s tease her some more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This isn’t your room, is it? Hey~, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~…… b, by mistake…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t make a mistake, can you~? Your room is in a completely different area from here, isn’t it~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… u~…… because…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae gives off an aura that said “don’t bully me anymore” while looking away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can’t help it. I’ll give her a break now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, she’s been very clingy in these last three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, she wouldn’t even make eye contact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There. Let’s wash our faces and go to the dining hall, okay? I’m going straight to the venue, so no roadwork today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, don’t be shy, and cheer me on as much as you can today, okay? Then, as a reward, we’ll play a lot tomorrow.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I said that, I got up with Amae under my arm and patted her on the head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Amae also suddenly looked surprised, and smiled at the next moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! I’ll cheer! Do your best, fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’m going to do my best.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt nice and calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was also relaxed and smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, good morning! Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiiya, big brother! …… Is that Amae? Where were you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… d, don’t know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I went to the dining hall, the sisters were preparing breakfast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t go for road work today, so I could have a proper breakfast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At last, Earth. So? How are you doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No problem.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… hmm…… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi confirmed my condition and gave a smile… or so I thought, her expression seemed to be somewhat complicated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi likes Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Elder Sis Tsukshi doesn’t want Mr. Machio to win this tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why she’s rooting for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it would be quite painful to not be able to cheer the person you purely liked from the bottom of your heart in such a tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if Mr. Machio wins the championship, he and Kron will… this situation was quite a dilemma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to win this, no matter what.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the winner having a child with Kron could just be Tre’ainar’s imagination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, we’ll be there to support you today. We’ll cheer you on together with Mortriage and the others!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Today, Oratski will be there… yes, we’ll support you together.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If Mobner is too shy to shout, leave it to me! I’ll slap him on the back and make him scream.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m making a lot of boxed lunches. Budeo eats a lot, so it should at least be that much!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, it seemed the other Sisters will come out to support me, and I… huh? What? I wonder…… those guys and these sisters… huh? Hmm? Hmm~?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, questions momentarily crossed my mind, but they were already gone now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who brought soup from the kitchen, and I suddenly came across each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Good morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, today’s the day… how are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nothing to worry about.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not awful, but I still felt there was some distance between us that kept us from joking with each other, laughing, or doing things like we used to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s been three months now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little sad about that, but at the same time I remembered something from before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That day… in the morning…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No…… it’s nothing. You’re also coming today, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’m… planning on it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the morning of the match, I talked to Sadiz like this, and that was when I teased her for the first time, for my reward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And confidently and proudly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll show you. So, keep your eyes peeled.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like that time, I’ll show Sadiz today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whether she had her memory or not, I needed to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if telling myself, I told Sadiz that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wish you the best~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a unique atmosphere, a nonchalant voice resounded in the dining hall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sisters quickly stood up in a hurry and bowed their heads in greeting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, this day has finally come, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It has.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, that is right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Kron. With a smile on her face, she looked straight into my eyes and nodded as she tried to assess who I am now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! Apparently full of energy, I think today’s Earth is very good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because of our positions, me and Jamdi’el will be watching from the special guest seat today, so in the interest of fairness, I can’t cheer for Earth alone, but I’ll be watching you closely! So, please show me, won’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Kron’s words smoothly permeated into me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron didn’t tell me “good luck” but said, “I’ll be watching”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. You’ll have to keep your eyes open, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was enough for me, so I nodded back to Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Un~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What’s the matter? Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah, nothing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was close. I stared at Kron too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Tre’ainar’s prediction is right and I accepted, I’d be with Kron… this fellow… I was thinking about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi… what shall you do on that matter?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What am I gonna do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At any rate, I refuse to just sit back and let others decide my path for me according to their own convenience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what made me who I am today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Jamdi’el won’t stay silent if that happens, but I won’t go quietly either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, Amae will watch too! Fight on fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes yes, that’s reassuring and encouraging.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufufu, please, Amae. Cheer me on. And Sadiz too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh? Oh, yes, I, I’ll, do… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for now, the first priority is to win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ate my breakfast with gusto.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to have the same kind of morning as I did then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, I’ll give it my all without any regrets!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once again, I got fired up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time I’ve received a 7th spirit for a single work, and I was worried that I would have to write about it, and last night in Minami I asked, “Hey, naked guy, do you have plans? A second one? Third? Just going to have a drink at a bar for now!”. I was wondering if I should decline the invitation of the beautiful woman who might have been destined to be my partner, and what I should do… when I received an 8th injection of spirit, so I dashed home to write.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, thank you very much. Drinking water and calming down may have helped me in many ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Alas, I might have been in a situation where even if the hair of my ass was pulled out and a nosebleed would not come out… And, while I was typing, I got hit by a 9th spirit. Funuoooooo!!!!!!!
</div>
