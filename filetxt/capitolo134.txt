<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A secluded nation isolated from the world. Only a small portion of the population goes out to the outside world, and has little to do with other countries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The country used to be a tyrannical and oppressive place where the royal family in the island had severely tormented the people with heavy taxes and other issues.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eventually, the people couldn’t take it anymore and rose up, plunging the country into a long civil war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the civil war ended, and the people’s revolutionary faction has won… apparently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What supported them was their faith in God and the presence of a goddess who descended from heaven and drew the blood of God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… God’s Statue can also be found here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ugh, Nu…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The former regime’s training ground has now become the arena of the tournament now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was smaller than the Imperial City’s arena, but it’s likely to accommodate thousands of spectators.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of the arena, there was a statue of Tre’ainar in a pose with both hands spread out from side to side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please grant your graces~? Oh God~ Oh God~ “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cease that at once!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was so funny, so I put my hands together towards the statue in prayer, as a means of teasing Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, Tre’ainar looked embarrassed by his own statue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Anyway, wrap the Magical Bandage now. I shall give you a phantom spar.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took the bandage out of my pocket and wrapped it around my fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tighten my grip and roll it up so that I can put force into it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now then, come.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike our spars in 【Vier】, there’s no contact or counterattack from Tre’ainar here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is just for checking the form.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shhi!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar doesn’t hit me, but he does check my rhythm by putting in a handling action.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, both the left and the right felt sharp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sound of my punches cutting the wind and bouncing off the air echoed, and the people passing by stopped to look at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, what is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “F, fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Better yet, how many blows was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breaths leaked, and a slight moan ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I’m a bit troubled if I get noticed or cause surprised at this level, but now I am not worried about what people think.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’d have to see it from a distance to know how many punches have been thrown. Moreover, that’s not the only thing that’s frightening…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was called out and turned around, there was Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… we meet in the same dojo almost every day… I was looking forward to seeing you compete today, but… seeing you face to face like this… as I thought, you’ve gotten much stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He saw me and gave me a compliment at the very beginning. It was a little embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Earth. I was curious… who were you fighting just now? No matter how you look at it, it’s someone of considerable ability. It looked like you were being pushed around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as expected, Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He didn’t think I was just shadowing into an empty space.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed he sensed from my appearance that I fought assuming someone in the world of fantasy and delusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who… God, I guess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey hey』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my words, Mr. Machio made a dazzled face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess he didn’t expect I’d make such a joke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s funny, because this is actually true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, hahaha… yes I see. But let’s keep that a secret from the master. Even if it’s a supposed fight, opposing God would summon her imperial wrath.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, that was a close one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Well, anyway… let’s give our best. Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Mr. Machio held his hand out to me with a refreshing smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shaking hands before a fight… it’s really refreshing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong? Gentle? Muscular? That’s why Elder Sis Tsukshi fell in love.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. To each other.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, do not get too friendly with the enemy before battle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said. But then again, Mr. Machio was a good guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little out of sorts, but I firmly gripped his hand back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That you~, Machio~?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shaking hands with youngsters in front of the venue, is he a fan? I envy your popularity.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That said, I’m gonna beat you today, right? That’s why I’ve been training bloody hard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excuse me! Winning is what I’ll do! Shhhh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One after another, a group of people with a distinctly different atmosphere from the other guests began to gather.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A well-trained body comparable to those in the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eyes that were also glaring for victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’ve never met him in the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, long time no see. You guys too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio seemed acquainted with them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio tilted his head to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, let me introduce you. They are representatives of our branch dojos for this tournament.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Branch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. The Arcane True Zenith Dojo has branches in remote towns and other areas. We’re at the Conarmy City Headquarters.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, come to think of it, Jamdi’el explained that to me at the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I had just regained consciousness after being kidnapped, so I wasn’t able to focus on that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gord branch, Zabers branch, Mechros branch, Central branch, etc… today is a tournament of representatives selected from all nine dojos and external participants like you and José.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Other branches? No, I didn’t check any of them out other than Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not like there were many of Machio’s class in the world. In the first place, Machio was the strongest in the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Machio. Who is he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. His name is Earth. He’s an external participant.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, he’s young.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Young, but don’t you underestimate him. He’s a powerhouse with master’s endorsement.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? What? The Master!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Mr. Machio explained to the other chapters about me, their expressions changed right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re a tough guy, are you? You.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The friendly atmosphere changed completely, and he asked me while glaring and as if putting pressure on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll take that pressure head on and answer back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To prove it, I’m going to win the tournament. Me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Declaration of victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, you’re telling me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, He has good eyes. So intense.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, a strong one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I expected them to react to my remarks with “cheeky kid”, but it was different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When they looked at me, they nodded with a smile as if they had felt my power in their own way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, others did not…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, he’s here… I see… the High Priestess said he’d be in the tournament.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh~, is this tournament open to just anyone~? How demoralizing~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the day when everyone learns the legend of José, a sacred tournament…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But no matter who you’re against, it won’t matter to you, will it, José?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph, I’ve failed to cut him many times, but… Senior, I leave it to you to hand discipline to him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, here it comes…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What the hell is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s a specialty of this town… more or less, don’t make light of him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Students? Ah, you mean the genius?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve heard that he was popular with the women, but that’s quite a feat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s one of the favorites to win this tournament?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The appearance of five bitches. Mr. Machio explained with a little sigh, and the other branch members nodded as if they were in agreement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be too hopeful. I don’t like to stand out, but … guess I have no choice… for the time being, I have to win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Come on, (Mr) (Senior) José sigh~♡“””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Him…… Oh, he’s going to be in the tournament, too. Well, he’s not a big deal, so whatever… and that’s the Machio that the High Priestess was talking about… Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, the dude, who I can’t wait to destroy right here, right now, has made his entrance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he looked at me with cold, condescending eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed to have just recalled me participating in the tournament, but immediately seemed uninterested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So that’s the genius, José? Earth, what do you think?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s really unpleasant!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No, I didn’t mean that… Or rather, your voice is loud.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio also smiled wryly at my reply.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was unavoidable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No other description came to mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And maybe they heard my voice, the dude who will make me vomit later, and five sh*ts who are only biologically women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you! I can hear you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. I meant for you to hear me. A bunch of obnoxious mass-produced waste of space!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the angry-faced sh*ts yelled at me… one sh*t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I talked back, there was always a “dude” that would be shaken up until it became ugly later…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You! What did you say… to the people I care about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Didn’t you hear me? Then, one more time ――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut ――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You shut up!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna shut up today. And I won’t back down, I can’t give in.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Usually, this guy would threaten the other party by stomping the ground and the walls with a sharp “Shut up”, but for the first time, I charged back at him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he’s surprised at my defiance, as I’ve always done as I’m told, they all were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So if you want me to shut up… then shut me up. In this tournament!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said, just to add insult to injury.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah … d … dear me. Don’t you know that weak dogs bark louder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed confused for a moment, but the dude cleared his throat afterward to smooth over his crumbling expression, and tried to say something cool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahahaha, are you stupid? Dude. This is the human world. Why are you bringing up matters of the dog world?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to shut up anymore. I’ve decided not to put up with it today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still, if you have such a fondness for it, why don’t I brand you like a dog? You’ll be branded a loser.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you… tch… such a trash talker…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I’ll declare it to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, wh, what’s with this guy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This guy… what do you mean? So far… different?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sh*ts seemed upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the sh*t that always goes, “slash, slash, I’ll cut you,” is at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Will all tournament participants, please assemble! We will determine the brackets by lottery!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the voice from the tournament’s organizers resounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come on, we’re almost there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, Thank you for your continued support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, I was hit with a double shot. To be honest, it’s the first time I’ve received more than 10 spirits, and I’m too hot to worry about catching a cold. Moreover, when I woke up in the morning, I was hit by another shot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, the overall evaluation of 1 million drill countdown was cut to 910,000 yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m really thankful to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the first time that the spirits and drills have increased so much, and I ran through the shopping district without worrying about the eyes. 910,000 drills left! For the time being, I thought I’d aim for another 10,000 drills by the end of the year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Best regards from now on!
</div>
