<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition to the representatives of each dojo, a total of 16 people will compete for victory, including external contestants who participate on the recommendation of Jamdi’el and others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A lottery will be drawn to decide the matchups of the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, unlike the time of the previous game, the lottery is not drawn in front of a large crowd, but it seems that the lottery is first drawn in a place like a waiting room and then announced to the gathering spectators afterwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right, Machio Proteen. No.16. It will be the eighth match in the first round.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the contestants continued to draw lots and their names were being recorded on the blank tournament table, I remembered the time of the previous match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, in order to fight Rival, I flipped the lottery over and picked a number, and I pulled the number 1.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next Earth Lagan”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu. Hmm… Whoa… number one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Got it, Earth Lagann, No.1. You will be facing José Drag in the first round, match one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… haha.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time I drew it myself. The same number.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the opponent was that dude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Were you aiming for that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If possible… I hoped.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufufu, you drew it yourself. Well, tis both luck and skill.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also grinning. He seemed to be in a good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Humph!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment he realized he was going to face me in the first round, my opponent had a clearly unpleasant look on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m happy with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because if he faced Mr. Machio in the first round, I wouldn’t be able to hit him with my own hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to let my guard down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I have a general idea of what he’s capable of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I don’t want to bully the weak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just that I won’t feel better if I don’t give him a single shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then the table is decided! These are the matchups.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, all the participants finished drawing the lottery, and the completed match table was posted on the wall.
</div>

 Kab Cavady (External)
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio Proteen
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess I’ll be facing Mr. Machio in the finals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, it’s an ideal combination. I’m not sure about the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, in the order of this matchup, the host will call everyone out for introductions, so we will ask all of them to appear in the arena once. After that, the first two fighters of the opening round will remain in the arena and have their match.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just so you know, the rules are anything but killing and grievous injury to the opponent! That’s all for the explanation! Good luck!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a fairly simple explanation of the rules. I felt like there were a few in the previous match, but anyway, this one seemed more a pure struggle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, you and I ended up on completely opposite mountains.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. See you in the finals, as promised!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the tournament officials finished the explanation, Mr. Machio came over and spoke to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, we’re on exact opposites. But I was fine with that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for joining us and welcome to the Arcane True Zenith Style Fighting Tournament!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At last, the host of the event started things off outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [And now, I would like to launch this competition between 16 men who will determine the pinnacle of martial arts in this country! Please watch to the end!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””UUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s quite exciting. It’s not as big as the Imperial Capital, but the passion isn’t lost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt like the ground was shaking a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, I will introduce the men who will compete in order of the matchups! Men among men, come on down!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””UUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, let’s start with this guy!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The flaring enthusiasm hit my skin. There’s no way you won’t get fired up with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a waning expression, the dude, who’s about to be sent flying by me, had a look that seemed to say “Dear Me” on his face. To start with, aren’t you a man??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, there’s Earth! Fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother, let’s go! Show us the results of that ‘Special Training’ with me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go for it, go for it, go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Best of luck …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, for the win!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hang in there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fight, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I stepped into the arena, there was a huge roar of excitement from a part of the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seemed everyone came to see and cheer for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahaha, this is a bit awkward, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s fine, Big Sister. The High Priestess also said that this is the proper attire for cheering, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fight on! Fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’m a little embarrassed, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s?! Similar to the outfit that Sadiz wore when she was cheering for me at the Commemorative Match!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Waving ball-shaped tassel-like tools or “pompons” in each hand, the sisters, plus Sadiz, were in blue sleeveless tops and short skirts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, even Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, it’s Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron, do not you wave your hand, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know~ Not just Earth, but today we watch everyone with an impartial eye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Splendid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the top of the audience seats, Kron sat in a big throne-like chair with Jamdi’el by her side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, she seemed about to wave her hand at me with a smile, but perhaps she was cautioned by Jamdi’el, she immediately withdrew her hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Will the sudden appearance of this comet be a bad omen or hope for the future? All the numbers he produced at the dojo are top class in the rankings! An unknown powerhouse who even sparred with that strongest Machio! Now is the time to show us what you’re really made of! The ‘Supernova’, Earth Lagann!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with a loud cheer, my… Introduction or whatever!? Who would have thought!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the audience seemed very excited anyway, so I stepped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And all the people of the packed venue, who saw me, cheered with joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But such introductions, are you going to do it for all of us?
