<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dear me, I don’t like to stand out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll end this in seconds.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Our fight was the opening match of the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The venue was lively and full of support for both of us, except for a ‘section’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, these two are the youngest participants in this tournament, and both were recommended by the High Priestess. One is an unexpected variant genius who appeared in the Wizarding School, his fame gradually spreading. Never has the depth of his power been witnessed, leaving many of his peers behind in the dust! Young girls attracted to such a man are rushing in droves to cheer him on today!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with the words of the heated host… the dude somehow sighed, “Dear me!”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, the five bitches were screaming and making a lot of noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [On the other side, this man also suddenly emerged. While his origins are all shrouded in mystery, his figures greatly exceed that of the other dojo’s students! And now the sight of him running around town early in the morning is actually becoming one of the city’s specialties. Today, even the sisters of the church have all come out in support! I mean, you two are really popular with the ladies, you bastards!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I raised my hand and responded to the cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Waaaaaah! Go, Fight on!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hehehehe, let’s go!! Bear witness, as they go all in for victory!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae and the others were excited, so I waved and responded with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nonsense. Ultimately, I guess that’s all there is to him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the dude sighed at me again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s so fun about standing out like that? I can only see a child who is desperate for attention and wanting something to prove himself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………? Is that so bad?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Someone really strong wouldn’t chatter on so much. He accomplishes what he needs to in a quiet and unassuming manner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And even though it’s a festival, this is a battle. Only those who are prepared to be hurt are allowed to fight. You don’t know anything about that, so you can talk so nonchalantly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can I put in a retort because you’re the one who’s chattering right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I heard something good. This guy was prepared to get hurt, no problem then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ooooh, we have a war of words before the start of the match! Youth! Such is youth, you guys! But I love it! So go ahead, do whatever you want!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host was about to announce the start of the match, but he rather encouraged him to say as much as he wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, just “Good Grief”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahaha, that’s right. But I’ll say it again and again! This tournament is a checkpoint for me! So winning is not a goal, but a challenge! Just one of the things I need to accomplish! So, I’ll win! That’s it! And prove it! Yes, I want to prove myself! As me! To stand out in the crowd, how about, to let the world know that this is Earth Lagann!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the spectators, who were so excited, quietly listened to our bickering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ambition, goals, and what we aim for are meaningful only if we achieve what we say we will. A quiet and unassuming manner? No, that’s like saying I’m ashamed of my loss or failure, or that I’m not confident I can do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th… that’s――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut me up then, you bastard!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the dude assumed an irritated stance, and I also took a fighting pose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Whoa, that’s all there is to say! Yes, from here on out, only their strength will do the talking! So, let the first match of the first round, BEGIIIIIINNNNN!!!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””UUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, the battle gong was rung.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now it’s on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the Graduation Match, I wanted to gauge my development against Rebal, so I checked my footwork first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next, I checked the feeling on my left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No worries, I’ve already checked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Bit Fire!!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve already confirmed that I’ve been dying to blow him away for three months now!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A sudden magic attack!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, what is that flame!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bitfire!? That’s Bitfire!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goooooo, José!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Feel regret as you are burned by Senior’s flames!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The looming fire. It’s released to burn everything down as it attacked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone’s making a fuss about my magic… is my spell too weak?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Not at all, it means too strong————”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment the flames were about to engulf me, he said something again, and I sighed and said…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! He’s so weak that I’m hesitant about knocking him down, pitiful!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone’s eyes rolled up at the words I shouted out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I shot a jab on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it was just a mass of fire flying in a straight line.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Screw Jab!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The mass of flames was extinguished when it collided with the wind pressure of my twisted “jab”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””…………… Eeehh??”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, the eyes of the bastard and the audience, who would not have known what had happened, hardened as if stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were too many gaps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Goose Step】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just stepped in and instantly came right in front of my opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, why are you just standing there?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, eh, huh, wha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m right in front of you, see? Where’s the punch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ts!? You…… take that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I approached before his eyes and asked, the surprised guy threw a straight right without any feints or build up, so I dodged it by ducking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, aiming for the moment when the dude’s right fist stuck out and his body was fully stretched for a few seconds…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You told me this was all there was to the guy, didn’t you? Anyway…… here’s what I’ve got!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stepped into his pocket, clenched my left fist, and he was defenseless, somehow… no, I hit at José’s body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that blow, I put in the feelings of “those” who sweated together and drank the same water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Solar Plexus Blow!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pyuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thrust my fist into his midsection. Angle, timing, power, speed, all good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pierced it in deeply.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 José, whose body was completely stretched, could not fend off the impact and ate it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dude’s spine got bent out of shape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What fragile abs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kah … huh!? Ka… ah …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, José stopped as if time had frozen in a mid-back position.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the audience fell silent in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wh, wh, wh, wha, what! He got in! Just a few seconds after the start! José’s flame is drowned out only by the wind pressure of a high-speed left, then the body attack by diving into the bosom at once! This is!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And José who had stopped……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jo, José!? Wha… eh? Wh, what are you doing… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, uh … right? A performance!? That attack isn’t working at all! That’s right!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s right, José only let him have one free hit… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course! I mean, look at him, José!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Senior won’t be shaken! Even that one gut punch didn’t make him twitch… at all…… eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the five bitches made a fuss, José wasn’t moving at all for a few seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, José’s whole body began to tremble as if convulsed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, ka, ha, u, upuh, uuuh, ubuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His cheeks swelled up as if something instantly overflowed in his mouth, and the next moment he broke down and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Upuh… O, obeeeeeeeeeeeeehhh, bleeeeeeeehhh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The entirety of what appeared to be the breakfast he had this morning came out in a sloppy mess from José’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi!? Jo, José!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, n… Nooooooooooo!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And José, who had thrown up everything from the mouth, collapsed to his knees, as fell down onto the mass of “stuff” that he had just puked out, covering his entire body with the foul odor, as he writhed in pain while clutching his midsection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, ah, ha, uo, ah, u, upuh, u, pu, wha, upu… wh…… w… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He couldn’t even scream because of the pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A smiting blow to the pit of his stomach, so he couldn’t speak properly because he had difficulty breathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the only things that came out were vomit and tears that were spilling for some reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jo, José… no way…… it can’t be!? Why? What’s going on?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, haha … is this a dream … what the hell?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s right, something’s wrong! No, this is also Senior’s strategy!? No, that guy used some underhanded trick! Of course he did!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some are confused and crying, while others are stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, they came to look like ordinary women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Su, such an instant kill!! Overwhelming victory!! Supernova Earth has shattered the genius into pieces! The genius rolls around covered in vomit and still can’t get up! The fight cannot go on! For sure, it’s over! This match goes to Earth Lagann!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””UUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the host declared the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the audience, which had been silent except for the screams of the women, instantly erupted in cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Am, amazing… Earth! In one shot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is intense… if I got that, I’d definitely throw up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aw, awesome… big bro!? …… so… awesome!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a splendid blow. And Amae. If you want to call ‘that’ out, why don’t you do it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unbelievable! It’s incredible! With just a blow to José!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, haha … certainly, to knock down José, such ridiculous strength. Ah man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh… this goes beyond ‘serves you right’… already, I feel pity for him, you know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I have to be careful when sparring with Earth, so that I don’t get hit on the stomach.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes. I got support from the cheering party, and even though it was only one shot, I really humiliated the dude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara~, is he all right? Even so, Earth is strong as I thought.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Truly thou is correct. Fufufufu… even if… that was pathetic…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes? Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s nothing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Goddess and Jamdi’el seemed to be in a good mood, and this was enough…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, not yet! Th, there is something wrong here… Senior cannot lose?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Soud…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, there’s been foul play! You coward! How dare, how dare you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then. The slashing woman jumped out of the audience into the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? She’s still as annoying as ever… even the princess looks better.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I will not allow this! I’m going to cut such bullsh*t down!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She drew her sword and slashed at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was so sudden that the audience and the host were slow to react.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood it normally, though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Be the rust on my sword―――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shatter into pieces.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She jumped at me and tried to swing down to my head, and I clenched my left fist and released a short upper … that is, a smash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, eh? Wha, how… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it was just a sword wielded by a woman’s slender arm. Light. Weak. And slow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… unfortunately, this is reality. If you can’t accept this reality, then go somewhere inconspicuous, out of everyone’s sight, and flirt with each other until you die.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I broke the woman’s sword in half from the blade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hold it! What are you doing, you? Jumping out of the audience and slashing at a participant… what the hell are you thinking?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sword… my sword… m, my… that kind of…… what the hell… th, this guy… h, he’s… really…… he’s so strong… ho… how…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [What an event from the first match! Hey, somebody take this girl away! And get José to the first aid room! Is Earth okay?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu. I’m fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oh, good. That’s good. No, I’m sorry. I was caught off guard. We will also make sure this doesn’t happen again, and she’ll be punished severely. For now, let’s move to the second match――――.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The slashing bitch, whose sword was broken by me, trembled in shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sighing, the host called for the organizers, instructed them to take the woman and pukedude away, and apologized to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a bit of a hiccup, but they regrouped and could go straight to the second match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……

 “Hi, n, ot… not yet…… yu, I’m not done, I’m just… uh… still not done yet… the match is not over… yet.”

 Puke covered dude exposed his sorry figure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like a newborn horse, he was trying to stand up while holding his legs down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [See here, José. That is it for the match, Earth wins. It’s your loss.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No!? I refuse! Not yet, I, Heu, not lost, yet… th, th, this guy did something dirty. Th, th… I won’t be fooled, hyu, i, it’s suspicious! A trap! Such foul play… geho…”

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 José was hobbling around, but instead of trying to do something, he was acting poorly and shouting at the host, who tried to stop him, saying that the match was over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, u, so far, tte… Ima big deal, I always won easily, without striving! I can’t lose… thats, it… with, this…… eh…… more, of this, if only…… I drank…… o, earlier…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 José took a vial of liquid from the inner pocket of his clothes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as a result, the match was over, but the fight was still on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, the start of the second match would be slightly delayed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, just slightly.

 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was relieved yesterday. The Japan National Rugby Team did it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a former Rugby player, I was still burning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m glad I managed to bring the Part 4 tournament at the same time as the World Cup.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want you to get excited together with me.
