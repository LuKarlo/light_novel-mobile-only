 AN: Aside from that, I haven’t said that I always post only at 7 am, so that’s okay, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, the Japanese National Team won and it felt good, so let’s go to the next chapter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 *************
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before the tournament, Tre’ainar told me something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. That one named José … he… is partaking in a certain medication that has been contraindicated since ancient times.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a few days before the tournament, as I was aching to test my growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Just by taking the concoction, the number of magic holes increases, muscles and magic capacity are elevated, brain functions are clearer and concentration improves… in a manner of speaking, tis a potion that raises one’s levels simply by ingesting it. Tis likely Jamdi’el’s doing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard about it, I wondered if such a convenient thing really existed, and at the same time I wondered why Mr. Machio and the others would be training normally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, if such a thing existed, the Demon King Army wouldn’t have been defeated in the past war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the reason was simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Naturally, there are risks. An overdose may cause abnormalities to occur in the body. In the worst case, you may die. Even if your life is spared, you will have to live with visual impairment, nervous and blood circulation disorders, hearing loss, auditory hallucinations, brain cell destruction, lack of reason, general pain, and various other side effects for the remainder of your days.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, there was that much risk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why it was forbidden.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, that man, José, his case is quite severe. He is young now and still looks healthy, but from what I can tell, he is already experiencing side effects in his daily life. His cells are already worn out. The prosperity of his descendants will no longer be possible.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The remark struck me as a shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, that José looked so bad, he’s pretty battered up already?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did he do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By any chance, did Jamdi’el do something to him? Is he being deceived?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there’s the temper tantrums…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The effects of the potion make one easily lose their temper, such as sudden fits of rage in the middle of a conversation and destroying walls and the ground.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, like Fu, saying “Are you surprised that my magic is too weak?”, is it the thought process that makes him unable to recognize his own power?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis simply his stupidity, regardless of the potion. In the first place, those who wield their power while unaware of how it will affect others and their surroundings, would be the same as a child swinging a knife around without knowing of the danger.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All right, let’s hit him without worrying about it. I thought so at that point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, it felt like I was making fun of Fu… well, that’s fine, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was such an exchange, but I didn’t think he’d actually do it in public during a tournament, I guess he just lost his patience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, hah… I…… I can’t, lose…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The outcome of the match was already decided, but José stood up and stared at me if it didn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that thing in your hand was what you’re referring to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you drink that, you’ll be stronger, but… isn’t it quite risky?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ts!? Y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The contents of the vial taken out by José. He seemed surprised that I knew about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… you also, from The High Priestess… receive… Divine Elixir…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No you’re wrong, I don’t drink that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m not drinking that stuff. I was just told about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That such a thing existed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, José smiled a little triumphantly at my remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so… you weren’t given the Divine Elixir? Or perhaps…… you were afraid of the side effects, weren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Hmm~ … God~… Maybe god doesn’t approve of it, does he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t be fooled. You and I are different. After all, you couldn’t handle the risks, you’re half-hearted! You may seem a little strong, but don’t get carried away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trying to be intimidating while you’re covered in puke just makes you look ridiculous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was relieved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… so you knew… the risks…… okay then.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Drink it, if you want. I’m not responsible for your life, I won’t be involved in the path you’ve chosen. If you’re doing it knowing everything, go ahead. That’s on you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, so pretentious… I’ll show you… my true power!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, José was so furious, he vigorously opened the lid of the potion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hey, what’s going on!? So the match is over… Hey! Wh, what is this!? José suddenly got revitalized… moreover, is that small physique… getting bigger?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the host tried to stop him, it could no longer reach José’s ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the host and the audience were taken aback by José’s Sudden Mutation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong with you, José? What is it? That liquid?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come to think of it, when José beat all the boys at school in their mock battles, he was drinking something, wasn’t he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Risks? Life? What are you talking about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the women who were lumped together as the José Girls had no idea either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How the power this man has in his hands came to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… how uncouth… I thought to consider him, just in case Machio proved ill-suited… he’s not even a viable option…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nay, nothing. For the time being, this match is won by Earth Lagann. That one is beaten. As such, the unseemly battle from here on is in violation of the rules, so please Lady Kron, feel free to support Earth Lagann.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beside Kron at the guest seat, Jamdi’el was watching with cold eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t feel any warmth towards this guy in her eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power that he got may have come from Jamdi’el, but isn’t she interested in it anymore?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s really pitiful…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oouuuuhh! I just hadn’t gotten serious yet! Let me sho… Bueh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, he was noisy, so I punched him in the eye socket with a left jab.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ge, y, uou …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, you self-intoxicated drunk. Let’s do this already.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, fine! I’ll show you! My seriousness! The magic theory I’ve come up with! From here, this world is on my time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, he came at me in a rage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gathering magical power in his palms, and at the same time he came towards me… I didn’t know what he would do, so I just hit a series of left jabs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pu, Pyu, ku … this, no matter how many hits… no need to even avoid it… Pyu, gu, pabu, Shu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 José was getting serious, powering up and trying to attack me, but he couldn’t get close to me in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was not the flicker, I just hit basic left jabs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gue, u, uza, gu, upu, ba, gou!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even the insensitive José must have noticed by now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goo, nu, th, this is!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No need to avoid it? Wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Whoa, oh, ooooooh, this is amazing! Earth’s left, left, left! José seemed suddenly energized and unleashed his power, but he can’t get close at all! That face has begun to swell! José, he can’t react to the punches at all! I can’t even see them! I mean, the fight is already over!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host accurately described José’s current situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it seems that the potion has increased his physical abilities and concentration, but even with José’s current visual acuity, my lefts are inevitable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, awawa, Jo, José… José…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no way, José’s face… it’s getting crushed more and more… hi, hiiiiii!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, how… that guy…… why, is he… so strong, that person!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I can’t watch this anymore!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The José girls also turned pale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sword swinging woman, who was being taken away, also looked back and uttered no words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, why can’t that José kid avoid such a simple left punch? What’s the trick?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true. He’s just punching him in the face…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it just looks like a repetition of the same punch…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, someone in the audience said that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as if to answer the question, I could hear the voices of the other participants who were observing near the entrance gate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s exactly as the audience said, aye. A repetition of the same punch. That’s all it is, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yup. He’s hitting without any gimmicks. But it’s fast. I can’t read the motion. So it’s impossible to evade it visually.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That can’t be reached by just looking at yourself in the mirror, practicing your form by trial and error and repetition, can it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “True, he must have a very good instructor. Was there anyone at Conarmy headquarters who could do that? Perhaps Machio? Or was it the master herself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it wasn’t me or the Master. He didn’t seem to be training under anyone’s guidance for the last three months. But I know Earth was working harder than anyone else. That left is the fruit of his tremendous training and effort.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How is that possible at such a young age?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku… there was no information about him. I need to get that information as soon as possible.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahahaha, well~, in any case, that genius boy… getting back up to fight again is admirable, but… how miserable. He could’ve used a more underhanded approach, such a naive guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean! Teenagers are supposed to be fair and square.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That liquid, wasn’t there something fishy about it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, you can punch him right in the face all you want, can’t you? Why doesn’t the Earth kid hit with his right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To put it that way, he’s been on the attack with only his left hand from the start.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s overwhelming just with the left… what a scary kid. Cute ass too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, that’s some huge balls. What about the testicles?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All the contestants seemed to be watching this fight side by side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All right, watch a bit longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, guuuuu!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, José, who couldn’t take it anymore, raised both hands to guard his face, I hit him with a left to the wide open body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you focus on the top, the bottom will be defenseless. Just like the theory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ogeboo!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, José spat out the liquid he had just drank.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You certainly got a bit more durable. Thanks to that, I was able to confirm the feeling on my left.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ts!? U, wh, wha… ju?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you don’t want to have your pride shattered, why don’t you call it quits?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After vomiting for the second time today, I asked José, who was fluttering while holding his stomach down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why don’t you give up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, you just think you know about the risks of the potion, but you’re actually trying not to think about it, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, won’t say it’s cowardly. I know how you feel. That’s why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up! What do you know about me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu… Fufu…… so far…… I didn’t think I’d be so ridiculed. You know nothing about me. The life I’ve lived… my resolve!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While wiping his mouth, José released his stance and slowly began to speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fine, I’ll tell you if you insist. My past. What happened to me? When I met the High Priestess and why I chose this path? My life that I haven’t told my friends about yet. After hearing this story, you won’t be able to say such cocky things anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he really tried to talk about it like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t caaaaaaaaaare!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bugoboo!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I punched him in the face with a left hook and blew him away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the next moment, José, who was blown to the edge of the arena, was faintly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at, the?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He asked, but the answer was simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do that in the church. I hate people who keep dwelling on the past.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, boomerang!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuguh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the last minute, Tre’ainar, who had been silent the whole time, gave a quick retort, but it seemed José was completely unconscious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Truly, completely settled, a perfect victory! Earth Lagann! He advances to the second round with dignity!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””UUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My victory was shouted again, and a huge cheer went up congratulating me, and I raised my fist in response to the cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s wrong with posting two chapters a day!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was dissatisfied with the fact that the battle with José did not end in one chapter, so I decided to end it in one day… but I’m tired. Someone, please hit me with a spirit, a drill, or an impact.
</div>
