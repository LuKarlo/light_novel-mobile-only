<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No damage, no stamina loss, no problems in particular, just my victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, it’s only the first round. Don’t let your guard down from here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The men at the entrance gate of the contestants leading to the arena applauded me as I looked across at the unconscious José and the stunned swordswoman being taken away by the organizers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Brilliant, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You showed me a super first-class fist.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first person to praise me was Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nodding to his words, the other contestants gave me a refreshing, congratulatory applause, despite being my opponents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But some of them were…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was impressive, but… I’m not as immature as the guy you just faced, right? I’m not like the inexperienced little girl whose sword got broken in half. Think of it this way, the second round is where the real battle begins.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there was a man that was a bit provoking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was the only one in the group with a sword at his waist, about late twenties to early thirties in age and somewhat dressed like an adventurer?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gran Chario, I’ll be facing you in the second round.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, that’s a really cool name … but …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Second round… you haven’t fought yet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, that too is true. Then, let’s stand on the same stage as soon as possible. In the next match.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, in that case, I’ll just watch from afar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahaha, nice one, you. You’re quite cheeky, but I don’t mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so with confidence, he flipped his cloak and spat out unnerving words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, wouldn’t a cloak be an obstacle in a tournament like this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well~, let’s put that aside, how about it, aye? Next time, why don’t you come to our dojo for practice, aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How destructive is your fist when you really thrust it out?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I like you. Would you like to train at our dojo in the future?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re certainly strong, but you should add more meat on those bones! Next time, come and eat our dojo’s famous hot pot dish!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “May I touch your ass?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why don’t we see which of us is bigger?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was suddenly surrounded by the people from the other dojos as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even when I look at Machio, he’s just smiling gently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was kind of embarrassed, smelled sweaty, and there were some people who I didn’t want to get involved with, so I slipped out of the circle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, later then. I’m going to join the audience!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re in a place like this, you’d still like to be surrounded by gorgeous sisters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just said my greetings and ran from the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ah…””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I came across those women, who seemed to be on their way to José who had been carried away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment they met me, the four of them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, aah… hi, sa, save… me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All four began to tremble in fear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, what do you think I’m going to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jeez… just go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Eh? Ah … Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Utterly, you’ve been looking down on a lot of people and running your mouths. From now on, you must live with a little more humility.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh … u …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go on, git!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They certainly pissed me off. No, really from the bottom of my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m not going to beat them up to relieve my sorrows.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, tis very kind of you. Were you not enraged at their laughter and taunts?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said so, as I looked back at the women walking away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absolute wastes. I don’t want to deal with that anymore. They’re pathetic enough… that José, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve already settled things with José.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, if they no longer want to get involved with me, that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I didn’t know at the time, it would be a little while before those women would really suffer the consequences of their actions, but… that didn’t matter to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child. There is one matter that bothers me still.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, what is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You said to José, ‘I know how you feel’, in the last battle, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh. I meant what I said.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When José was angry, he said, “What do you know about me?” but he meant it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I thought about it. If I hadn’t met you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if I hadn’t met Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would still be rotting away in the Imperial Capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would have been coasting through the academy, feeling inferior to the princess, Rebal and Fu, and being crushed under my father’s and mother’s greatness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I wondered what I would have done if I had met Jamdi’el first and was offered that potion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That potion came with risks. However, just drinking would still make me stronger than I am now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can get power without sweating, fatigue, or putting in the time and strenuous effort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What would I have done if I had been offered such a thing back then?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar. If I’m honest, there may certainly be a risk to the potion. But, if it was possible to get out of my current situation with it… and the feeling of wanting to take it… I can understand that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What was that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I hadn’t met you. If I hadn’t been able to experience the joy of training and feeling myself get stronger day by day. If I didn’t know the fun of being taught more and more new things. If it had been me back in the days when I was stuck in the Imperial City… so, if I could get stronger than the princess and surpass my father, mother, and get Sadiz to recognize me… I think I would also have dabbled in that potion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s only a possibility, and I don’t think I want something like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I made one wrong move, I might have ended up like José, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think so…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I don’t know. I don’t want to help him, and I don’t care what’s going to happen to him. But I guess I understand. I think that’s why I said that earlier.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was just cheesy sympathy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I don’t really care what will happen to José who got beaten up and humiliated by this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But when I thought about what might have happened… for me… that I met Tre’ainar first… from the bottom of my heart, I was really glad that he was my teacher.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? …… Huh?!! …… Nu …… Oh ……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Tre’ainar? He looked really upset… eh?!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『N, no, no, no, th, no, that, uh huh, uh huh, ah~, that, wha!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, not at all, yeah, I did it, yes, oooooh, yes, 1st win, the first round is my victory!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『O, ooh, t, tis so. Uh huh, you won! Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yeeeah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh! But stay alert. Be sure to watch the other matches and prepare for the next one.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu! I understand!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh, that will do! I wish you luck!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, the two of us saluted each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. To Tre’ainar, everything I’m saying in my mind was open to him… Yeah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the fact that we wouldn’t touch each other… was an unspoken agreement…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fu~…Ah~…Well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, we forced the end of the matter there, but Tre’ainar still wanted to say something, and after a little groan, he sighed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah… child. I do not believe so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believe you are different from him. Even if you had not met me first.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I didn’t know what he was talking about, but soon I realized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s about what I said, “I might have done the same thing as José “.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, you were twisted. The greatness of your parents and the talents of your childhood friends were wearing away at you. However, you were still training every day in your daily routine. Studying, swinging, with diligence.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Sadiz forced me and …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You might have been made to do it, but you were still doing it. You were spending your days on self-improvement. Unlike him, unlike a pig who had acquired a little power, and was already satisfied and lived a lazy life without sweating every day… unlike those who had lost the will to fight due to the difference in power, and sat languid in the back of the school building. So, you are different. I reckon so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it’s a hypothetical scenario.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a story that can’t be confirmed no matter how much you think about it, and it’s pointless to argue no matter which opinion, mine or Tre’ainar’s, is right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was happy and proud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I don’t know… no, I think I would have used it, yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t be honest about it either, so I turned back, smiling wryly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No? You reckon I could be wrong? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but I know the most about myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You dare! I have been observing you objectively, so I know you better than you know yourself!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I would use it. Oh, I would have!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, you would not use it!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I would use it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You would not have!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I would use it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You would not have!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I would use it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You would not have!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the two of us were arguing loudly, trying to cover our embarrassment from each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What … what are you doing? By yourself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I turned around at the call, Elder Sis Tsukshi, Sadiz, and the Mortriage crew stood there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah, it’s not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not~, we came to congratulate you on your victory, but what’s all the fuss you’re making by yourself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?! Oh, no, I mean, yes, I’m just happy to have won, yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes? It does feel that way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, no, don’t worry about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, everyone who supported me came down to celebrate my victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn’t notice, so I hurriedly covered it up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, it’s a quarrel, but from everyone’s point of view, it only looked like a dangerous guy making a scene all by himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, for the second match of the first round! Here he comes, the face of an old man, but his physique is the shortest in this tournament! However, capable of tossing big men around, ‘Soldier of Devastation, Jawara’! Facing him, can this fallen star regain its light and rise again? ‘The Exiled Rebel Swordsman, Gran Chario’! This is a battle neither can afford to lose! Now, let’s begiiiiiiiiiiin!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the host’s rowdy voice was heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, looks like the second match has started. Look, we’ll be up there watching―――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hurriedly tried to cover up what just happened and change the topic … but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [One hit! …… no freaking way, ahem, that’s the match!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, already!? Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that it was decided way too soon… I mean, I didn’t even get to see my next opponent’s match at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I managed to make it this morning! Thanks to your drills and impact. Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, drills and impact may be the best legal doping??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, there are various things that cannot be recovered in the José-related area yet, but I’m sure noone is interested in them, and I’d like to settle for the time being, and from the next time onward, I’d like to include a few other matches. Within the range of all ages. The existence of the author is sufficient for the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Okay!! I’ve avoided enough Yaoi to know where this is going…
</div>
