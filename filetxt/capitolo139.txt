 [At that instant, such exquisite control of soft swordsmanship! The match was an embodiment of that! Right at the start of the match, Gran Chario’s special sword was unleashed! Something like, 【Star’s Death Omen】 bang, 【Judgment of the Constellations. The Twinkling Star that became the Meteor, the Guidance of the Heavens Once Again―――】 well he was trying to do something with some long-winded speech, but in an instant, he was grabbed by one of his arms and thrown, hitting his back and unable to move. And so, Gran Chario is defeated! The star did not shine, it was knocked to the ground!]

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The live commentary from the host was as passionate as ever. Hearing that, I thought, “Hmm?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I recall, the guy who had challenged me earlier was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The winner of this match, ‘Jawara, The Soldier of Devastation’! He advances to the second round with flying colors!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gran Chario…… tte?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, he was defeated just like thaaaaaaaat!!?? Eeeehhh? No, no, no way, to be that full of confidence only to lose… isn’t he José level?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””That metaphor is too much!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~…… well, that’s fine… no matter who comes next, it doesn’t change what I will do. No matter who it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, the match to decide my next opponent was over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, the guy I expected to be my next opponent was defeated without difficulty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little surprised, but I decided to switch my stance if I didn’t mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, w, well, putting that aside… however, that match just now. It was amazing, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right. Got me thinking we can’t just stay depressed, and only talk about overthrowing José! Ora, I’m gonna do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. It’s not about José, I’m going to work hard to become stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ll have lunch with us all afterwards!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Putting aside the current match for the moment, and not mentioning my boisterous behavior, just celebrating my victory of the first round for now, the Mortriage crew raised their hands with laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! I’ll do it again next time! Just watch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded and gave everyone a high five with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So quick, Earth. Surely, you were a little too strong!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya~ I feel sorry for the other guy! Well, my assistance gotcha real motivated.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui nodded with a smile and words of gratitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, it may be the first time I’ve ever won and been praised in this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Up until now, if I win, I would be the “Son of the Hero”. That was it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I ran away in the middle of the Graduation Match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason I was so happy that my heart and eyes were a little warm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yo…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Congratulations”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz bows her head in a reserved manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How was it? My fight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes…very…it was splendid. I shudder to think that you haven’t gotten serious yet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From her… for the longest time…… I wanted this. Well, what a cowardly thing I did…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…ro…er!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, someone muttered something in a very quiet voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A very young voice… isn’t there only one person?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~…… ol…… ther”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow her face was bright red and she was so fidgety.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Funi ~yu~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? What is it, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How about that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike those insensitive bastards, I have a good sense for various things, but I can’t figure this out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Amae, let’s do our best~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right? Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? But does Elder Sis Tsukshi know what Amae is trying to say?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was pushing Amae’s back and giggling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know what was going on, so I tilted my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, everyone, please get out of the way~ coming through~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ehho, Ehho”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, from across the corridor, a couple of men walked past us carrying something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were carrying a man on a stretcher.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~ hi~, on my head~, stars are spinning around~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man, who had been so fearless, was being carried away with a really pathetic look on his face, as if stars were spinning around his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… in the end, what’s with being one-shotted?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Gran Chario, who had declared war on me in the second round.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, he’s become a star… he’s not dead though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… haha. Earth’s next opponent is Jawara.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Old Man Jawara’s a miss~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the current match, which seems to have been a very counteroffensive, Elder Sis Tsukshi was laughing in spite of themselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And apparently she knew who my next opponent was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know him? Well, even though it is a branch, it’s the same Arcane True Zenith School…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uo~~~~~mumumumu~!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I forgot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me, Amae was in a foul mood with her cheeks puffed to the limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m sorry, Amae. So, what were you saying?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~, Ng! Un! Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ha?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, for some reason, an angry Amae ran up to me and banged on my stomach with her little hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, eeeeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! Un! Un! Un~da!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t hurt, but… and, Elder Sis Tsukshi had a bitter smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Erm, I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But after hitting me for a while, Amae suddenly stopped her hands and instead leaned her body against my belly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……… gyu~tsu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her face was pressed against my belly, and her voice was muffled, but still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……older brother……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could hear it clearly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment she uttered those words, Amae suddenly separated her body from me, and instead held her pompoms in both hands, with her face blushed red…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O…… ol…… U~~…… older brother, next time, fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moving her body as much as such a little body could, waving and thrusting out her pompoms, and jumping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I saw that, it was like thunder was echoing in the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~, uh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, perhaps the limit of embarrassment has already been exceeded, Amae just ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was stunned for a while as I stared at the little back running away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha, ahahaha, I guess she worked just as hard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya, I’m sorry, Big brother. Amae, really wanted to call you ‘older brother’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi and other sisters were also smiling at Amae’s appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I still couldn’t move an inch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If possible, could you forgive her?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. she’s been fidgeting for the past few weeks or so, getting all excited and eager to say something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s not about forgiveness or not, just one thing became clear to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bring on the second round now! If you want, all the contestants together, come at me!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””No, no, no, no, it’s surprisingly straightforward!!??”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could probably do anything and beat anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I felt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that shouldn’t be the case, so I decided to sit back and watch the next match from the spectator seat for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When watching a match, I’ll put Amae on my lap.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday I had more drills and impacts than I expected, so I went through the day with a surplus of energy that I didn’t use up this morning. For the time being, José-related things have settled down, so the author is now comfortable.
