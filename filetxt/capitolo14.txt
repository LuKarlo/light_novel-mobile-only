 “And what do you use this ladder for?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It’s ladder training.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fully motivated, I changed into my exercise clothes of short-sleeved half-pants, went out to the large garden of the mansion and sat down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not just sitting down, I’m flexibly loosening my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar calls it “stretching”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the problem is the mysterious use for the ladder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis about increasing one’s agility and perception. To grant you the Ultimate Step… gain the 【Magical Step】technique.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The technique has a sh*tty name… but I won’t say anything……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Come up with the technique name yourself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, rather… keep going…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I don’t say it, he would find out what I’m thinking. Well that’s enough. If it’s for the boobs, I’ll take it seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fine, we will settle this later. First, stretch your body firmly, gradually. Concentrate.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, haven’t I done enough already? I’m pretty limber.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Still. Tis to improve physical ability and make a daily habit of it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… fine. But can you tell me what kind of training we’re going to do? Do I have to be flexible, what’s the ladder for, and anything else?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… Training schedule or… Well, if you’re curious…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do whatever I’m told for the time being, and put in a serious effort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wanted to know what the hell I was going to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First of all, you take the time to warm up by stretching then ladder training. After that, body technique exercises, and practice magic and forbidden arts which best suit your physique.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Huh? Oh, wait a minute.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… What? Surely you have no complaints, right? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing to words “Forbidden Arts” mentioned so casually at the end made me anxious, but, well, the other party is the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the Great Demon King teaches you magic, you may end up with a curse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But one more thing that bothered me was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When do we train my swordsmanship?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m the category of 【Magic Swordsman】, same as my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been practicing it since I was a kid, and am still swinging 5,000 times a day. Even if Tre’ainar says too many times for training is useless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『About the sword… I will not use it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? …… You mean you yourself don’t use a sword?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No. You…… do not possess the aptitude for the same heavy-handed swordsmanship as Hiro.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…………?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In other words, you lack the talent to be as Hiro.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, you’re wrong? A ridiculous remark was uttered as if somehow my life so far would be completely denied!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It seems you have mixed feelings about your father, yet at the root you probably long for him. Hence apparently your techniques and swordsmanship imitate your father.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, well… I’ve been imitating him since I was a kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But tis just an imitation. Enough for a second-class opponent, but you can never achieve a breakthrough.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the son of a hero, but I’m not cut out to be a magic swordsman…… It can’t be, all my life I’ve been told and been compared to my father, now you say I was ‘never talented’……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『On our first meeting between the seals, you tried to attack me with a 【Magic Sword】, did you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, at that time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes. At that point I was already aware. You have no talent for that style.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still could not easily accept the sudden remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s only natural. I was denied all I’ve accumulated in my lifetime, even though it was short.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, seriously… how do you know that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered how he could say that to me though we had just met yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, can’t be helped… tis a long-winded explanation, but… Humans, demons, and demonic beasts each have distinct forms and distinct masses. Features, such as speed and reflexes, also differ. Nothing in this world can fit everything the same. Do you understand this?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s true, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At the same time, the swordsman uses a sword, and the brawler brawls… meaning each has a body and function that suits them.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, to my question, Tre’ainar explains it in a very theoretical manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For instance, a giant orcs may have an ideal body for swinging a club and attacking with power. Do you believe that giant orcs are good at ballet and such?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… That is…… Sure…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Following that logic, for you a 【Magic Swordsman】… rather, Hiro’s fighting style is unsuitable. He is the type to focus a suicide attack on a single point without thinking ahead. He utilizes the firepower of his magic in the sword to the utmost in order to defeat his opponent. This is realized when the person possesses great muscle mass, a tremendous amount of magical power, endurance and fortitude to resist a half-hearted counterattack. None of this applies to you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than understanding, the more I listen to the long explanation, the more depressed I feel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are Hiro’s son, but your inherent strength and magical power differs from your father’s. No matter how much you imitate Hiro, you can never surpass him.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, it’s as the Demon King says, so I guess that explanation is really true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t be my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have that talent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, it was a shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, by being given clear guidance by someone like this, I immediately had a lot on my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Haha…… Ever since I was little… all that time, I was swinging my sword.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It became a habit. On rainy and windy days, I never missed my practice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The skin on my hands peeled and my nuts got smashed… Even so……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『On the other hand, for a hard sword style like Hiro you have ample flexibility, as you have mentioned. Tis a supple body that springs. Perhaps you… are more akin to your mother.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you to use a sword, your fighting style will inevitably be built up around the sword. But first of all… you, the function of your own body…… In other words, by facing your individuality, you must begin by making the most of yourself. To reexamine the functions of the body, physical techniques are the best.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was in the middle of a shock, so I couldn’t hear everything, but his last words reached my ears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have another “talent”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you are bound as a swordsman, you may be best suited to wielding that gentle, flowing sword. However, if you are to wield it, first of all, you must be intimate with the functions of your own body rather than the arm of the sword. If so, to master it in two months time might be feasible.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked up naturally and tried to listen to Tre’ainar’s words without speaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said to me, “I’ll never be able to beat my father, even if I imitate my father,” because it sounded like she was saying, “I have my own talent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike my father, my personality is my own. I never thought of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And Hiro is a single-cell idiot… He can only use simple, power-driven magic with an emphasis on destructive force, but fine spells were beyond him. Magic is not just about having magical power, it also requires a brain to understand the theory behind events. You are better than Hiro in that respect. Expand the magic more.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just the sword. It is true that my father can use the “Blow-All System” in terms of magic, but I have heard that his grasp at the more detailed ‘Auxiliary System’ of magic is not good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? Surprisingly, father has a lot of faults?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you understand? If you diligently apply yourself to training, of course, you will win the championship in two months. If you bestow more time, it is possible to raise you to the level where you can defeat Hiro!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those words, it wasn’t just big talk or being swept by the momentum of our conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was simply an idea and the chance of the victory in properly following Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the rest depends on if I can put it into practice or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『How is it? Child …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the rest is up to me. I could not help laughing at such a question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha-ha… My father… everyone around me… they would be surprised. The son of the hero ‘Hiro’ will not fight as a 【Magic Swordsman】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You do not approve?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-it’s not… Somehow, I have a rather pleasant feeling about this! Not like I’m my father’s son……exactly, more like I’m myself! I feel like a curse upon me has been reduced a little bit, and it made me feel better.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got it. I was shocked, depressed, but I felt a weight off my shoulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt liberated from something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve already found that I don’t need to imitate my father and feel a complex.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now that I’m free of such a thing, I’d rather have the elation of something new that suits me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please, Tre’ainar. Lead me to the right path.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this time, regardless of Sadiz’s boobs or any motivation, I myself felt ‘I want to do it’, and I was genuinely saying that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, I am always indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked at the ranking of the day this morning, it was the second place overall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m here to thank you for being here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suge!!! But it’s nice and frustrating!? I remembered a certain thing in a place where I had mixed feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The main character Earth also said the word that someone somewhere used to say in the story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do I have to be in first place? Can’t I be in second place?”Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
