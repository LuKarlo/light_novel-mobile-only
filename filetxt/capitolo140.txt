<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, it’s time for the third match! And the next one is another hot battle! A man who has trained only one weapon, a straight punch with his fists. He kept hitting and hitting, even to the point of bones breaking, joints dislocating, or the fractures sticking out! The fist of the man who pursued only one thing eventually turning into a blunt instrument, a blade, a weapon! Show off that destructive power! ‘Krouby, the Fist of Destruction’!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The third match was just about to start after I joined the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [His opponent is the opposite. He worked on all genres. Throws. Grapples. Punches. Kicks. Instead of polishing one weapon, he has polished himself so that he can respond to every scene assuming actual battle! The man says. Krouby, you’re not pursuing just one thing, you’re just skipping the others! Today, I’ll show you that! ‘The Jack of All Fighting Trades, Juju’]!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two men came out with the introduction from the host.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a good look. In my opinion, Juju looked stronger because of his body and posture and atmosphere when walking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I’ll have to take a seat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s~ see~, seat seat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother, over there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, there it is. And here you are.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The section where everyone was when cheering for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae had already returned and was sitting there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Amae~. Why are you running away?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I approached her with a smile on my face, Amae’s body jerked in surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Fumyu… U…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll sit next to you. Hey okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hafu?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was amused to see her fidgeting again, so I sat down next to her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey~, big brother~. That’s my seat~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, I see. Now that I’m here, so my seat… hmm~, what should I do~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey~, what do you think~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was sitting where Karui was originally seated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, because of my arrival, we were one seat short.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do we do now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this was planned in advance with me in Karui, so we were grinning at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh well~. Hey, let me have Amae’s seat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Amae didn’t sit on big brother’s lap. That’s what you always do at dinner, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Amae sits on my lap during meals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, it was same as always.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Amae herself is still reeling from her “brother” remark earlier, so she was reluctant to move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, Amae. Don’t let Karui sit down.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, as a nudge, I tapped my knees and invited Amae to sit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae looked me up and down with a puzzled expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it okay? Oh…… ol…… der…… bro…… uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, it’s embarrassing to say “Older brother”, even though she usually jumps on people’s backs, hugs them, and sits on their lap.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, she may be scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Amae doesn’t have any blood relatives.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can call me whatever you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, I lightly put my hand on my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Amae was momentarily stunned, but also regained her determination…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O…… older brother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ou.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… older brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it, Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first she was afraid. But she gradually checked, and finally called me that clearly, and the next moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~~~~~~~,yaayyy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nowa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of getting on my lap, she dove into my belly with her whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mufu! Amae’s older brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She showed me a really carefree smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She rubbed her soft, puffy cheek against my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such an angel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahhhhhh I’m glad! Amae. Following uncle, you have an older brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother, you’re surprisingly kind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Muh, I want Amae to call me ‘brother’ too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder sis Tsukshi seemed happy. Well, I guess I’m a little out of my element, but for the time being, I didn’t mind that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, tis still only the first round of the tournament so far, should you be so nonchalant?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Osu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I guess my face looked a bit too relaxed. Tre’ainar came in to caution me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, I might have lost my focus.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let’s watch the match seriously …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ooohh, he’s got the joints! It’s too much to bear, and Krouby taps out!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, it’s oveeeeer!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again, I ended up not seeing anything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [No way, Krouby’s fist caught Juju’s face once, but Juju held on to take Krouby’s arm and lock in the submission! However, it was a close call. Look at the blue swelling on the right side of Juju’s face! What terrifying destructive force. And great work by Juju to withstand it! Oh uh, the two share a handshake praising the good fight! Please give a big round of applause!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s over… I missed two fights in a row involving opponents I might face if I won.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Utterly, slaking.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’m ashamed…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re right, I slacked off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, was it a failure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Amae was in a great mood, leaning back on my lap and humming to herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, it’s not just about scouting your opponents, it’s also a good opportunity to learn about various fighting techniques…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「My bad, I need to focus a little bit.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Naturally. In the first place―――― Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… huh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar and I both sensed a presence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A strange presence beside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked over, and there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No~…… beating down a guy of the same generation by that much, a very funny sight… I’m wondering which is the real you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A strange man approached me laughing as he stood upside down with one hand on the fence of the audience seat where we were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other spectators laughed and reacted to it, and Elder sis Tsukshi also shouted in surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!? Hey, Mr. Wacha!? You scared the hell out of me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmmm~, as usual, what are you doing ~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha. I recognized that man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, he’s one of the contestants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was a conspicuous man with a bare upper body and long black trousers below.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was slender and not bulky, but looking closely, he should have a pretty good balance of his core and toned muscles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Generally…… I’d say he’s passable…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No~, I was looking for the young man who showed me a wonderful fistfight earlier, hoping that he would come to train at our branch, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently I’m the purpose. Or, come to think of it, this man said such a thing a while ago after the battle with José was over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, well, if I feel like it I suppose. I’m not really a follower of the Arcane True Zenith school.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind that, aye. If anything, it’s okay to just join our branch, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Hey hey, it’s not an invitation to practice, you’re soliciting me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little surprised because I didn’t expect to be scouted like that here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Amae, who quivered at the question, suddenly got off my knees and glared with her arms open outstretched at the man called Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U~~~…… won’t give him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing that figure, we burst out laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oops, I’m sorry, aye. I didn’t mean to take away the little one’s boyfriend, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong. Older brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’ll keep that in mind next time, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha laughed at the appearance of Amae and apologized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even if he said solicitation, he didn’t seem to be so serious about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… you’re not a student of the Arcane True Zenith… according to Machio, you’re self-styled with no master. Is that true?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm … oh … well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I do have a master, though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there was no other way to get around it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… that’s amazing aye… so, you can hit such a beautiful left? Without anyone’s guidance?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha was surprised with a mysterious face while standing upside down with one hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it certainly is true, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was supposed to have no master, I suddenly leveled up and used techniques that no one knew about, so everyone was surprised at the Graduation match in the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Up to now, I’ve been able to cover it up, and Jamdi’el did not really ask about it, but if such a matter is pursued deeply in the future, I’m not sure I will be able to answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I know things I shouldn’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly, we shall need to consider the excuse to make in the future.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar was the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then you’re a genius who has a good sense and a thorough knowledge of the human body, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, uh, uh, is that so? I don’t know myself, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh uh huh, by all means at least once, let’s do battle… oh, yes yes… if I can win, it will be possible. As for this, I’ll have to bring my best, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He laughed when he said that, but he’s got confidence in himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, there are examples like José and Gran Chario, so I’m not sure if I can take this confidence seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then there’s no problem here. Because I’m sure I’ll win. The rest is up to you. Am I being cocky?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment Wacha jumped from a one-handed stand and stood with both feet on the fence and looked at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nice. I love it. A previously unknown man suddenly transforms himself, makes a name for himself, and roars strongly. It’s like an ascending dragon, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhaha, isn’t that a little too much praise?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m complimenting you, aye. Let’s see if that dragon can fly through the sky and even shatter the heavens. As expected… of the Master’s favorite, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha… hah? For sure, I guess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somewhat, he’s so exaggerated, I don’t know what’s going on anymore…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm? …… this one… at present…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, next is my match aye. I’d like you to talk to me later, aye~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha jumped from the fence straight to the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I didn’t really understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar seems to have noticed something, and he’s looking at Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That one… might be more than meets the eye.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? What? Somehow, just because Tre’ainar said that, I thought that a man named Wacha might actually be pretty strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t do it today. Two chapters is impossible. Yesterday and the day before yesterday were special.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, there were many kind comments from everyone who cared about my physical condition, and I was deeply touched by the thoughtfulness.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
