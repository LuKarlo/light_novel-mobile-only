 [Up next, it’s the 4th match! The oldest practitioner of the Arcane True Zenith style makes his appearance! In recent years, he’s been working to expand the reach of The Arcane True Zenith by coaching the younger generation and spreading health exercises for! But, his true form is that of a fighter. Don’t you know? He’ll demonstrate it to the unenlightened! At long last, he is unveiled, the ‘Veteran Warrior, Wacha Huacha’ is here!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, let’s have a look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guy Tre’ainar had shown interest in can’t be an ordinary person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do your best, Instructor Wacha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Wacha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Waaacha, Huacha, Wachahowacha ♪ hai!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Waaacha, Huacha, Wachahowacha ♪ hai!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The audience was cheering, I guess he’s pretty popular.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, what’s with the cheering call?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Elder Sis Tsukshi. That guy…… is he famous?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Well. The strongest in the Arcane True Zenith school is Machio, but Mr. Wacha is the one with the longest history.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About ten years ago… when The High Priestess and a little goddess descended upon this land, Wacha was the first to become the High Priestess’ apprentice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Isn’t that detail surprisingly important?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s Jamdi’el’s first disciple?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [His opponent, he’ll eat up the old history in one go! The man who boasts the heaviest weight of the Arcane True Zenith style, claiming that body mass is talent, power, and pride! For men, eating and sleeping to make the body big is also training. In other words, the strongest continue to train all the time along with the talent of physique! He is the ‘Super Heavy Freak, Khaldash’!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as I was thinking of paying attention to Wacha, his opponent was also quite something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… it might be a good chance. Why don’t you use him as a reference? Budeo.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… fat is the talent and power he is proud of… s, so cool… eating and sleeping is training… I definitely want to learn!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, of course that’s not it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first glance, he seemed similar to Budeo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he is different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Budeo was soft and flabby, that man who appeared was quite solid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A huge pile of muscles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a different muscle mass than Machio, and was obviously heavy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you were rushed by that, it would be pretty dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, he’s got a good expression on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A spirited look that is crackling with a desire for a clash of power vs power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dosukoーーーi! Dosukoーーーi! Much obliged!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What was that? That Khaldash guy was squatting and raising and lowering his legs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh, Amae, were you surprised? But…… what’s that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily surprised, Amae was also a little scared and held on to me tightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could feel the vibrations transmitted by him stepping on the ground repeatedly with the foot raised high.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What kind of exercise was that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis Magical Shiko.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Magical Shiko?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh. Tis the basis of Great Demon Sumo Wrestling that was once mastered by those who were called Rikishi in the Demon Realm.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sumo?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never seen this kind of exercise before, but naturally Tre’ainar knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh, this is how the Shiko is performed…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Standing in the gap between the seat and the fence, Tre’ainar suddenly showed the same stance as Khaldash … hey!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gueh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older Brother?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Big brother, what’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost burst out suddenly. However, there are people around me now, so I had no choice but to endure it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 B, but, th, this, surprise attack?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As such, spread your legs and knees to the sides, straighten your spine, place your hands on your knees, raise your legs high alternately, and step on the ground powerfully. Dosukoi!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King opens his crotch… no, no, stop! If I laugh now, it’ll be suspicious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dosukoi, Dosukoi! See. This will strengthen the waist, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and trunk.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Puhyu… oh, oh … I see…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You, and Budeo, should take this up. Tis quite taxing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I, I get it. Next time…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I shall remember this for tonight’s 【Vier】, you cur.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I thought I was safe!? Well, then don’t do that! You’ve got to realize that anyone would laugh at you at first look!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Endured. I managed to endure it… but immediately after, I seem to have been called out for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t help it. No way, the Great Demon King suddenly shouted “Dosukoi” in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Instructor Wacha. I’m honored to be able to face you. But that’s why I won’t cut corners and will come at you mercilessly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s scary aye~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Fufufu… that’s a tough joke.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while I was holding back my laughter, this got serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why those who are watching have to take it seriously too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s go!! I’ll take your best shot!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Khaldash lowered his hips and placed his hands on the ground to show an unusual posture.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the first time I’m seeing such a stance, but it was clear that he’s trying to build up momentum and charge straight for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then … come aye…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of a man with such a spirit and stature, Wacha showed no sign of fighting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like a water surface without a single ripple, he was quiet and calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By the way… according to the host’s explanation… he gives instruction in Magical Taichi… well, surely he has been passing on incomplete knowledge that was received from Jamdi’el… to that extent… no…… that stance… tis different…… that is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, with a hand on his chin, was observing at Wacha a bit intently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then, match number 4! Begin, now ――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dosu―― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the signal to start the match, Khaldash lunged forward with a powerful step――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wachaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “―koi! tsu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Khaldash lifted his hands off the ground to charge, Wacha’s left hand chop was stopped before Khaldash’s eyeball.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… f… fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Loosely, from a relaxed posture, his movement was unperceivable, and by stopping his left-handed chop just before, he controlled Khaldash, who was about to rush, before he could make a move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The crowd was in awe, and I couldn’t help but be surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu… good job holding your ground aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your reflexes and self-control are splendid aye. But, as someone who in any situation rams his opponent in an initial charge to not stop no matter what, I don’t know whether or not it’s the right choice aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Khaldash stopped moving at the last minute, his face pale and sweaty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally. One step further, and his eyeballs would have been crushed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, to suddenly go for the eyes… that guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the 【Great Demon Finger Jab】… Moreover, tis almost completed…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a technique I am yet to teach the child… I had no intention of teaching it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it is called a jab, I thought it was a skill that had something to do with me, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you still going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, of course I am! Dosukoi! Dosukoi! Dosukoi!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even with his face pale, Khaldash shook off Wacha’s hand and threw himself in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He launched a continuous series of strikes with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He approached Wacha as if he was a wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Wacha…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hwa! Hwa! Hwa! Hwa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, gu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of Khaldash’s hand slaps were handled with quick hand movements. Moreover, he not only dealt with them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hwa! Hwa! Wachaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After deftly handling them all, he finally sealed the opponent’s hands and threw a high kick to the wide open face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh, o, oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Splendid … the 【Great Demon Trapping】』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was holding Amae on my lap and involuntarily leaned out of the fence to watch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Wacha approached Khaldash, who ate Wacha’s kick to the head and was dazed, and stuck out his right hand to almost be in close contact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huachaaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was like magic? Shockwave? He just thrust his fist out of a state where it was almost in close contact with the opponent’s body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Khaldash who was called the “Super Heavy Freak” …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [He, he was blown awayーーーー!!?? The Super Heavy Freak is lightly blown off, and immediately crashes into the wall of the arenaaaaaaa!!??]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he was sent flying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait a minute! What’s going on!? Did he use magic?? How did such a huge guy get blown away!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Short Strong(Fajin)… also known as … the 【Great Demon One Inch Punch】 is what was used…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a technique completely different from the jabs and straights I’ve been used to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a complete unknown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Such an outrageous punch, by Wacha Huacha! And thus…… Khaldash, he’s out cold! No contest! This match is a victory for Wacha Huacha!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Waaacha, Huacha, Wachahowacha ♪ hai!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Waaacha, Huacha, Wachahowacha ♪ hai!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the victor was decided, and at the same time, the crowd erupted in cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha bowed to the audience with his hands joined together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya, as expected, Mr. Wacha. After all, in a fight, he’s really strong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed, I’m amazed~. The man in question is humble, and his ability does not reach the Three Fingers of the Arcane True Zenith. Machio, Bro, and myself, that is what we are called, but in a serious fight, he would be much stronger than me~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder sis Tsukshi’s words were convincing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shuddered involuntarily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, with Mr. Machio, I can’t compare who was stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly, power and speed are inferior to Machio and Karui. The overall physical ability will be much higher than the child. However…… that man named Wacha is so skilled that you cannot tell at first glance.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar also approved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Wacha had strength that I couldn’t gauge by looking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. I’m intrigued by that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed. You’re quite fortunate, child. To go out into the world… people of such skill are scarce. A good… ‘Training Partner’. Well, should you make one misstep, you will be blinded.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn’t particularly have my eye on anyone in the tournament, except for Mr. Machio, but it got a little more thrilling and I was starting to enjoy myself a little more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ladies and Gentlemen, this story is a high fantasy. It’s a story of a hero and a demon king jumping out of the world of magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Please note that it is not a different world martial arts novel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, in this story, we do not discuss “Which Fighting Style is stronger” or such, so please forgive such a retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did this happen? When I was trying to avoid an OP development at a magic school against opponents of the same age, for some reason it ended up like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, to change the story, sometimes I questions about how to read Tre’ainar’s “child” in the impression column, but I call it “Warabe”. Some people think it’s “Wappa”, but it’s “Warabe”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason is that in one of my favorite Chinese historical manga, the main character is called “Warabe”, and I somehow liked it, so that’s the influence. Kokokoko.
