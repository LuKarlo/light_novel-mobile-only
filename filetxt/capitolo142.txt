 The tournament was still in its early stages. Sometimes it got heated, and at times screams erupted due to a dreadful scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahaha, hya ha’ ha’ ha’, hyahahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Habu’, gubyu, byu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A big man sat atop a petite, neutral-looking man and was mercilessly hitting his face, crushing him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nooooo! Shota’o!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Assistant Instructor!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, uuugh. I can’t stand it anymore!” Our Assistant Instructor… eh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, let’s go! I’m gonna kill him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The one-sided match brought tears and anger to the faces of the women who seemed to be related to the beaten man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wow, this is already beyond merciless! Shota’o who was knocked down by the tackle that Denchok unleashed soon after the start, who then took the mounted position and immediately beat him down! Shota’o fans all over the venue are screaming! On the other hand, men who are thinking “it’s what he deserves” are definitely not going to be popular, are they?!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a cold-blooded scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeerr, but that’s it! That’s the match! The winner is Denchok!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hyahahahaha!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the discretion of the host, he decided to intervene and forcibly ended the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the already listless opponent was swooning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a clear difference in strength and the man’s thoroughness, the women in the audience bit their lips, and at the moment the man made a guts pose, the women tried to rise up with murderous intent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the next moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This comrade of mine … I will carry him to the first aid room.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man named Denchok said so, and began to carry the man he had just beaten up in his arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, Denchok? No, no, we’ll take him…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you saying? The two of us exchanged fists… he is a fellow warrior. I should at least do that much… so allow me to do it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so, Denchok smiled refreshingly, a complete change from the crazed look he had previously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wh, what a refreshing sight this is! After the battle, the man is already a friend! He is going to carry his injured comrade with his own hands! What spirit! You must have reformed in prison, Denchok!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it was a refreshing spectacle to say the least.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, “Sense of incongruity” and “Unnaturalness” were out all over the place, and no one tried to applaud even though the host tried to liven things up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Assistant Instructor… hey, we’re going to the first aid room too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I must go and see him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He lost, but I think teacher did his best. We must all cheer him up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the women nodded to each other and tried to go to Shota’o, who was being taken to the first aid room, but Denchok noticed it and yelled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be a woman loitering around a defeated and injured man! Do you want to torment his heart any more than it already is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””……… Eh?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you say to a defeated man? Did you do your best? Was it close? Let’s try harder next time? That’s bullsh*t! That’s the greatest insult to a fighting man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Denchok’s words cried out so. I could only accept that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man fought with all his might and was defeated. I wouldn’t want the women there to touch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you love this guy, leave him be. Don’t worry, I’ll stick around until the second round… I’ll keep an eye on him. Trust me, Ladies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The women looked down for a moment at Denchok’s words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Are you kidding me?! What are you planning to do to the Assistant Instructor!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, dozens of women stood up from the audience and rushed out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Did that Denchok say something to offend the women right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, ahahaha…well, even though he was released after his sentence… yeah, it’s a little hard to trust him~…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh, uh huh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And for some reason, Elder sis Tsukshi nodded with a bitter smile as if she agreed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Why? As I recall, the introduction says that that Denchok guy is an ex-convict, but is he someone who has committed a crime that makes him so untrustworthy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, big brother… Denchok… committed that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one mentioned what the crime was, or rather, they seemed to be incredibly reluctant to say, but I guess they were just that averse to saying it out loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, there were a lot of incidents, but let’s have some guards in the first aid room just in case. Then, moving on to the next one … hmm? … Wha what??!!… Eh!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, no one said what the problem with Denchok was, and the host resumed the proceedings and tried to announce the next match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, a man who seemed to be one of the organizers rushed to the host and whispered in his ear, and he looked surprised…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Eh~, I just got word, as we were scheduled to start the next match, Seissé vs. Samyng… Apparently, Samyng attempted a sneak attack on Seissé, but the tables were turned and he is now unable to compete. Therefore…… the first round victor will be Seissé by default!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, something happened where I wasn’t looking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The venue was in a stir… not really, unexpectedly, there were voices such as “I knew it” and “but it’s so dumb,” and they didn’t seem to be very surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, dozens of young kids who seemed to be related to the man named Seissé who won were crying out in joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey waitaminit, what was that ~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A sneak attack… that’s all… but Mr. Seissé fought back, it’s just like him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Hey, that’s it? Shouldn’t there be more of a reaction?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well~, it is Samyng we’re talking about…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… what’s going on, Arcane True Zenith? Aren’t there a lot of people with a quirk or two? Are there no more normal guys?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh… when you put it like that… the next match is… even more…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I held my head, I heard about the next match and Elder sis Tsukshi and the other sisters grimaced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? You think there’s a bigger weirdo in the next match?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell kind of guy is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Amae suddenly began to tremble on my lap…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Need to pee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This girl… goes at her own pace…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You want me to take you!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go with me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, ga… y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, toilet time. And she wants me to go along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I can’t do it by myself…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahaha, I get it, big brother. I’m going too. I just noticed, my bladder is at risk.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! I’m saved. Well, maybe I’ll go too… well, no matter who the next match is … Mr. Machio will win in the end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s right. Mr. Machio is next. Well, I have to come back really quick. Come on, sister, I’ll take you there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Karui!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no choice, so I decided to go to the toilet, held Amae, and left my seat with Karui.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I want to watch Mr. Machio’s match, so I’ll run a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya~, but the battle of various seniors is exciting after all~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right? If you really learn to fight, you’d be stronger than me, wouldn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There you go again~ you’re overestimating me big brother! And? Are you paying attention to anyone else besides Mr. Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way to the toilet, Karui asked me about the matches so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I missed a couple of matches, but at this point I’m only interested… in one other.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoo. And that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One man who came to mind when I said that. Even Tre’ainar recognized the man’s skills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If there’s no problem, he’ll be in the semifinals…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s Wacha.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, yeah… hey wait up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Wacha happened to pass in front of us as we were sprinting to the toilet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he was in a hurry and didn’t seem to notice us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it wasn’t like we were close enough to call out to him, so we just walked on by…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I’d pass by. But then Tre’ainar noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. His hand…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hand?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar told me, and looking at Wacha’s hand as he was running away, I saw that he was holding a crystal… a Magic Crystal!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a glance, but it certainly looked like one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was a magic item for long-distance communication. It’s a magic crystal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s not that uncommon… but was it also available in this country?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t seen one in three months since I came to this country, and it’s an isolated country in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, oh, oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s nothing for me to care about. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… briefly… just follow.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, Tre’ainar seemed to be a little worried about that Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if he’s worried about something besides the fact that Wacha was strong…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry, Karui. I’ll leave Amae to you for a bit.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? Big brother!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll be back soon.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother!? Ah, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Later!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I decided to follow what Tre’ainar was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Over there.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I kept following unnoticed, there was still something, Wacha ran outside the arena and moved to a slightly less populated place to hide.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how you look at it, it’s totally suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, while looking around a bit, Wacha whispered in the shadow of the building…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on~…… I’m in the middle of a festival, so please give me a break, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha was muttering into the magic crystal. Then, from the magic crystal…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Don’t say that. Your ‘boss’ and my Lord were sworn brothers back in the day, right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know who it is, but for the time being, a man’s voice came back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if you say boss… the organization has already been destroyed, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So you don’t talk to us because you have nothing to do with the organization anymore?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t go that far, aye. That’s why we talk regularly like this …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So? Have you found the final key? The Dark Valkyrie playing house with that doll. The Lord is concerned.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s what is being determined right now, aye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh. Previously, the human named Machio was a candidate, but has something changed?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No change… aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I see. For now, be sure to report it when they make a decision. My lord is dissatisfied with the idea of mixing human blood with it, but if the key is satisfactory, he says he’ll support it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that, the conversation in the magic crystal was cut off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, it was… obviously a meaningful conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, the Dark Valkyrie was an alias for Jamdi’el. Does that mean…outside of this country… organization? Boss? Destroyed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Support? Such a liar, aye… if you’re going to make it with humans… I should suffice…… I believe so anyway, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a twitching smile, Wacha muttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
