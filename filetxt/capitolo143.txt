 [This is out of the noooooorrmmm! Even Data is taken aback by this! Apparently, it was much larger than the information that Data had researched beforehand! Yes, careful observation is required if the boys haven’t seen each other for three days! In the face of Vigg’s Excalibur, Data has lost his will to fight and surrendered! For Vigg, it’s a brilliant victory!]

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? It looks like the match is over. But what kind of match was this, anyway? I’m really curious about the content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, what I’m most worried about is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar. What do you think of that Wacha guy?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way back to my seat, I asked Tre’ainar about the scene we had just witnessed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believe he is an outsider… or rather, like Bro, someone in a position come and go to the Outside world.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It seems so.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The people of this secluded nation have been in this island country for a long time. They were born, raised, and will die here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, when asked if no one can go in and out, it doesn’t seem to be the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that there were times when people go outside like Bro, or on the contrary, bring in his friends to the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, Wacha might be someone in such a position, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, putting that aside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What were they talking about earlier?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To such an extent… nevertheless…… it did not feel like a matter that bodes well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. The problem is that Wacha seemed to be connected to someone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, that person knew the true identity of Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Most importantly……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Playing house with that doll…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I don’t like the way they put it, but… there’s only one person that can come to mind when they say that.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis that one.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yeah.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A pure and innocent goddess. It’s probably Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, they also know about Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The world has yet to know of her existence, but she is a presence that could change the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it was just within this island nation, there were people in the outside world who know of Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Things smelled much too dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If the Allied Forces, Mikado, Hiro, and Solja knew about the existence of Jamdi’el and Kron, they would not have let them be over a dozen years. Above all, nothing of note has occurred in the three months since you arrived in this country.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s right. So…… they’re not with the Allied Forces…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t the Allied Forces that Wacha was in contact with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so, an Anti-Government organization.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Above all else, the one who spoke from beyond the magic crystal said…’Human blood’… that implies…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The Demon Realm… the remnants of the former Demon King’s army…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『An Underground Organization of the Demon Realm… or the likes, there are so many possibilities.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There certainly were many possibilities, but none of them give a very good premonition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little heavy-hearted, and at the same time Tre’ainar sighed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Although she is formerly of my Six Supremacy, Jamdi’el now hides among the humans. And then, a peculiar group acting covertly behind the scenes? Might be the trend of the times…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the past, when people hear the name of the Six Supremacy, they would prostrate themselves to its majesty. All feared making enemies of them, they were simply incapable of clandestine maneuvering…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, they are legend. But it’s been over ten years since they vanished. If I hadn’t been intimidated by Jamdi’el, I wouldn’t have known the weight of their existence either.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hah~, tis lonely. “White Fiendish Emperor Hakuki”, “Beast King La’iphant”, “Damsel Commander Norja”, “Dark Valkyrie Jamdi’el “, “Titan God Gouda”, “Black Sage Paripi”… and the Great Demon King who brought them together… it was a perfect army, and yet… two of their numbers died in battle when I was alive and well…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’m not very familiar with it, but it looks that way. So, four of the living Supremacy… well, two of them, Jamdi’el and Hakuki were declared missing, and they’re infamous wanted persons.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The names that once played a central role in the former Demon King Army and have now become legend, including Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the legendary situation, Tre’ainar seemed somewhat lonely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I never thought that one of them, Jamdi’el, would be in this country, though.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so… La’iphant… would be surprised to know.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah! Now he’s the Supreme Leader of the Demon Realm. I’ve never met him, I’ve only heard about him in newspapers and classes. Seems he and my father meet on occasion.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By the way… might be late in coming, but child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『On the other hand, on the side of humanity… what of the other Seven Heroes? I never cared as I really had no interest in anyone other than Hiro, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, come to think of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only my father, mother, and His Majesty, but the other heroes were once enemies of this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I have seen Hiro, Mamu, and Solja. The remaining four…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, both Rebal’s parents and Fu’s parents are alive and well, and they both hold important positions in the Empire. I haven’t seen them in a while.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~…’The Sword Saint’ and ‘The Great Mage’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So I’ve heard that Japone’s ‘Kojirou’ is the top samurai warrior in his country. The last one from the Bethreal Kingdom is――――」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~~~~, Kabadi Kabadi Kabadi Kabadi!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Tackle! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [He got caught! Kab faints in agony! A sharp intense tackle by Machio! So Fire! However, even though Machio accepted the special stipulation that Kab desired in good faith and fought, Machio still overwhelmed him! On the other hand, Kab’s heart was broken in the process! Here is the winner! Machio advances to the second round!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I couldn’t watch Machio’s match… but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh… hold up it’s over already… but, now’s not the time for that…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. Still, you cannot afford to be distracted by the uncertainties and lose the opportunity to gain strength.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You may say so…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I couldn’t concentrate at all when I watched Machio’s match in my current state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I’m still worried. And does Jamdi’el herself know about this and about Wacha?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least Kron wouldn’t know anything about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Playing house with a doll… ha…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Sympathy? I tell you, cheap sympathy is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I don’t care if it’s cheap, I think it’s pitiful, so I guess it can’t be helped」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My oh my… what a turn of events…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I replied to Tre’ainar’s words of advice and clenched my fists tightly, a little pissed off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well fine, if you’re curious, I can ask Wacha himself directly. And, I’ll most definitely face Mr. Machio to decide the champion, right? Then, I’ll teach them. Each and everyone will know who I am.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps, but child. To that end, the next match…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Don’t underestimate him.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis fine in that case. Experience various things, let your opponent wear himself out, and then knock him down.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that purpose, I will quickly settle the second round.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, which of the living Six Supremacy was it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, this has nothing to do with the above, but after writing a lot of interactions with Amae recently, there were suspicions that the author was a lolicon, but that’s ridiculous. Therefore, I will try not to write too much for “young” girls, except for Amae, so that I don’t get any strange suspicions. I’m sorry when I put it out by all means. After all, age is a serious matter. On the other hand, if you’re older than a certain age in the settings, it shouldn’t matter what I do…?
