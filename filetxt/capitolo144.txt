 “Older Brother, Fight on! Fight on! Fure fure, older brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that it’s “fine to call me that way,” she’s no longer ashamed, and now Amae was leading the way in cheering me on from the bleachers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With her small body, she was shouting with all her might, waving her pom-poms and jumping up and down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While thinking that I have to respond to that, the name of the opponent facing me in the second round is a man named Jawara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Osu!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We bowed to each other with the same greeting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As an impression, my opponent was a short-haired man who seemed quite single-minded, serious, and hard-headed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But his height was much shorter than mine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although he was small, he had thick muscles for his physique and looked quite heavy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, he doesn’t seem to have a body that would allow him to move very fast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this man’s “really noteworthy feature” was not there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, let’s start the second round of the tournament with the talents who finally won the first round! Each has earned victory in the first round. However, one is a young man who has shown his brilliant talent that makes us feel the future. On the other hand, is a man who has been steadily improving himself over many years. Will it be a contest between talent and effort?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That makes it sound as if I haven’t made any effort, but well, it’s only been about six months since I started to seriously push myself, so I guess you can’t blame him for saying that…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, looking at me like that, Jawara said with a laugh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t have to make such a face. I know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re young… I could see from the left punch in the first round that you’re blessed with ability, but you’re also working bloody hard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I met Tre’ainar less than six months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Half a year since I learned about real effort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just a half year. But six months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not proud of my efforts, but even though it’s only been half a year, I think I’ve had some intense days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why the words “I know that you are working hard” really touched my heart instead of compliments such as “The Son of the Hero” and “You’re blessed”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was delighted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You too, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think he can honestly acknowledge others because he himself experiences such days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was evidence to prove it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar… this guy… his ears are going to be awesome.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man’s “really noteworthy feature”, that comes first and foremost, rather than height, physique, face, or eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw it for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ears of the man in front of me were melted and crushed, and the hole is also blocked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this does not mean that they were “unusually shaped from birth”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『His ears have a good shape. With that alone, I have a feel for the man’s fighting style and the days of bloody training.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the man’s ears, Tre’ainar nodded with deep emotion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The ears have been scraped many times on the floor, and bumped into the opponent’s head and the body many times, eventually causing internal bleeding in the ears, and as a result of repeating the same process again before it heals, the hematoma hardens and deforms the ear… a man who has been hit by his opponent over and over again, being knocked to the floor, and still stood up and made great efforts… tis the ear of a fighter.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From that word, I couldn’t easily put away the word “effort”, and it made me feel the life of a man… Jawara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, look at him. Smaller than you. His footwork is not so agile due to the manner in which his muscles are attached. In terms of overall strength and talent, you are not inferior. He is not as talented as other warriors I have seen and made a name for themselves in the world. Tis why he worked hard to make up for it and overcome it, and now he stands before you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing those words, I try to touch my ears. Such beautiful ears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nevertheless, as you know, a fight is not a contest of effort. Be merciless and unforgiving, do not let your guard down or underestimate your opponent, and crush him with your left.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it doesn’t matter what your ears are or how much effort you put in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is a place to compare our strengths.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I don’t mean to underestimate my opponent, but I do care about how I win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like in the first round, I will win with my left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Then, let the first match of the second round, begiiiiiiiiin!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the start signal, Jawara stood flat-footed, lowered his hips, and held his hands up in front of him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no sign of an attack coming from over there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously, he was waiting for my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t think he had enough speed or dynamic vision to evade my left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But he’s aiming for something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I stick to winning, not how to win, I could run around him with my feet then hit and run…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Flicker】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll chop him up from the front with the left here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Uooooooh, the lefts from Earth are like whips, cutting through the air and Jawara’s skin! So fast, too fast! Instead of the unmatched precise lefts like the first round, these are violent lefts he’s throwing!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, this guy can’t avoid my left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it seemed he had no intention of avoiding it from the start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, his muscles and bones were pretty hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu, what a left, what speed, trajectory! You’ve been hiding something like this … but … I can’t fall! I’m confident in my endurance!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jawara stretched out both hands while being hit. But he didn’t hit me with his hands or shoot magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what was he doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh, to, h, here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I paused and carried on shooting with the same rhythm, so Jawara moved in time with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the sleeve of my clothes that he grabbed with his hand until he got a nosebleed after taking so many of my flickers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gotcha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An unknown technique. From there. Grabbed my sleeve and what… eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? My body…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just grabbing my sleeves broke my entire body’s balance and center of gravity. I couldn’t put in any power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, my left arm got caught under Jawara’s armpit, and he immediately collapsed while pulling me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Circle Throw(Tomoe nage)】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A throw!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was thrown as he fell down… this is bad!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was trembling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I was in trouble, and I writhed in panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hold on my left arm, which was locked by Jawara, was also shallow, so I was able to slip out at the last minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, so close! One more time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I managed to get out of it for now, but if Jawara had more “power” and “speed”, I would have definitely been slammed to the ground on the back… probably…… I imagine… my arm might have been broken or dislocated at the elbow by the momentum.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a nasty technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, what the heck? What is that fighting style?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter how many hits I get, I’ll endure and get a bite in, just need one shot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a bare-knuckle style, no magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unlike Machio, I don’t meddle in techniques or other soft paths! I have pursued only this path, don’t think you can destroy me with a little bit of effort!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jawara’s not punching me or kicking me, he was going for my clothes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this his fighting style?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, Mr. Machio? What does Machio have to do with this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not done yet, kid!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, 【Great Demon Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Endure, endure, endure!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And maybe he got used to the pain of my flicker, Jawara drew his chin, guarded only his vital points, and jumped into my flicker storm again, trying only not to pass out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With just a moment of offense and defense, his face had already swollen up, but he still approached me with teeth clenched regardless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he gets close again and jumps into my pocket, would he grab my sleeve or arm and throw it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Such an unusual fighting style…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufu, such manner of fighting exists as well. Remember that.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sure, if a faster, stronger guy did the same thing to me… I’d be horrified…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was an unknown technique, for sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s fresh, to say the least.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuh, tsu, say, but … it looks rough, it’s actually a sophisticated punch, and it resonates with the core… but…… to put it badly, your punch is, too polite!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you are prepared to be hit and as long as you cover the vitals… if you grit your teeth… it’s not enough to reap lives! I can bear it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Jawara, who approached step by step while being engraved with my flicker, shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufufu, tis too polite… that is what he says, is it not? Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was grinning as if looking at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, there were many ways to defeat Jawara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keeping a distance with footwork and preventing the approach. Intercepting on the right. A barrage with magic Breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you’re concerned about winning…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t look down on it. My left is too polite? I can be rough, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m in! From the bosom…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jawara finally jumped into my pocket.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Thigh ———”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As if!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ju, show me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? A feint!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I aimed at his face and shot the left, and Jawara, who had been hit so far, crouched on the spot and evaded my punch for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, right after, reached for my legs with both hands…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re too focused on the top, and the bottom is open, kid!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Double-Handed Mowing】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’ll reap my legs… or, so it seemed……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Rabbit Punch】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He tried to mow both my legs, I naturally punched Jawara at the “back of the head”, which was naturally exposed directly under me, when I pulled back the punch that I missed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, guh, gu … oh … guh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In an instant, Jawara was dazed, his knees were shaking, and he was completely defenseless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a flicker, but a straight left jab that took the shortest distance with the least amount of movement, striking him in the jaw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, Jawara fell like a puppet with a broken string, and that’s it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Al, already, won…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, in an instant…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jawara collapsed, and the venue was silent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a very intense battle for both of us, but it all ended in less than a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [O…… Ah… Yes… in a flash! It was a split second decision! Hold on, I watched without time to add the commentary… anyway, it was Earth who won the battle! It was a dignified advance to the semi-final!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of the late host and the cheers erupted at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ts… ugh… eh?! Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Jawara, who had lost consciousness for about 10 seconds, suddenly woke up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked around, and looked at me and was a little stunned, but he seemed to understand the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I fainted. Me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it’s only for a few seconds…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~~~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Knowing that he had lost, Jawara flopped on his back and laid there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve been slammed many times, and hit over and over again… I was confident that I could withstand the pain, but… it was not enough for those unexpected punches…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t want to be thrown and slammed on my back… if I was unlucky, my arm might have broken.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Invigorating. Even though… I shouldn’t be ‘going easy’ on youngsters like this~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Going easy? I was fixated on how to win, but I don’t remember you cutting corners?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~…… once more, let’s go from the start.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Jawara stood up again, staggering, but laughing, tapping my shoulder lightly with his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother won! He won!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even such a blow… remarkable, you do some amazing things, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But he’s strong. That Jawara in an instant…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I responded to all of them while raising my hand, and at the same time I waved to Amae and others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I saw Mr. Machio and Wacha, who were watching my fight beside the arena entrance, and smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hurry up, I’ll be going ahead, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to my smile, Mr. Machio and Wacha gave back fearless smiles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
