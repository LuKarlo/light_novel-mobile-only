 『Did you stretch out your muscles a little and hurt yourself? Well, tis no problem, now is it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, no problem.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Besides, during a tournament like this, the adrenaline is pumping, so you would not feel any pain.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the end of the match, I left and checked my body for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Repeat the shadow to check the condition of the arms, elbows, and joints that were about to be clinched by Jawara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… that was a pretty dangerous move…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To some extent, the fangs of his efforts have left their impression… such obstinacy…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was a worthy opponent, to be sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jawara almost got me, it looked like he stretched my muscles a bit with that ‘Circle Throw’ or something technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there is nothing wrong with this much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I tried to get back to watching the next match…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… um…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I turned around, I ran into someone I hadn’t expected to see, and my body trembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, Sadiz. I was so surprised by her unexpected appearance that I let out a strange voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is she doing here alone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought so, I noticed “something” that Sadiz had in her hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um…… I know it’s not my place to ask, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She held something out to me in a very reserved manner, it was a bulging cloth bag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And leaking from the bag was… Magic and… cold air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ice?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Apparently I could use magic as well, so I… made it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking into the contents, I saw a slightly larger piece of ice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excuse me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stay… still, please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart started pounding. She approached me, took my left arm, and placed the cloth bag with ice on my elbow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Sadiz’s scent wafted through the air, my mind was shaken, but at the same time my arms were slowly cooled down, making it eased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis icing. Accept it obediently, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Aisingu?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed. It has benefits such as preventing the deterioration of muscle fiber damage, suppressing swelling, relieving pain, and even preventing ligaments from stretching.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, that’s what she’s doing?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My head felt better and my fatigue seemed to be lessening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was this another effect of icing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Sadiz knew that…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…It’s… getting better.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m glad, but don’t overdo it, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I said that frankly, Sadiz smiled gently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pardon?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… are you doing this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s smile tightened my heart for the first time in a while, and I couldn’t help but ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Sadiz looked like she was thinking for a moment and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… when I think about something happening to you, even slightly… my whole body started shaking… I had to do something… once I realized that, I found myself here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew that it was probably the former Sadiz, who was always cold, harsh, or teasing, but was actually more over-protected than anyone else, that would have made her do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, it was heartrending.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had mixed feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… now I’m still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Aaaaaaah right, just before the start of the match, as Vigg and his opponent came face to face with each other and unleashed their fighting spirit, he made a give-up declaration!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, a groan and the boisterous voice of the host burst from outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [First-class swordsmen understand their opponent’s strength before drawing the sword from the scabbard. In other words, it is the second- class and third-class that would draw out a sword against an opponent they can’t beat! And Vigg, with his first-class Excalibur, knows this. Without pulling it out, he knows just how good his opponent’s sword is, just by confronting him face to face. Vigg Mhara, give up! Machio Proteen’s advances to the semifinals!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To put it bluntly, it was the kind of development that brought a ‘?’ floating in my head. But once the decision was made, it could not be overturned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Mr. Machio won.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [And with that top four have been decided! At this point, I’d like to ask the four warriors who have made it this far to come out before you! Men who were chosen from men among men, come on out!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, the host was calling for the winners, including me, as part of his service to the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can’t be helped, I have no choice but to go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… this…… is enough… for everything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I returned the ice bag to Sadiz, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m healed… ah… thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… no…… next time… please do your best. But don’t…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t overdo it… I want to graduate from “Little man” already…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? …… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thanked her meekly … that’s all, but still, I hesitated a little… it’s also painful and lonely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feeling like that, I headed to the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, the semifinal match-ups will be ‘Supernova Earth’ vs. ‘Veteran Warrior Wacha’, ‘Cavern Seeker Denchok’ vs. ‘Superhuman Machio. Who will be the last one standing?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I walked out into the arena, everyone was already there. So I ran up to them and lined up beside Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were four of us: me, Wacha, the weird man, and Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Behold, the four super-males who have triumphed!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A big cheer rose once again for us who have won from all over the venue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [As the nickname implies, Earth Lagann has wrecked geniuses and hard-workers alike since the first round with his unparalleled senses and fighting ability! Making his presence felt as a guide and a wall for his students and disciples, Wacha Huacha, wielding skills worthy of such a role! Although branded for life as a sinner, Denchok Jahr, who has surprisingly defeated the best of the best in this tournament without breaking any rules! The number one contender, the overwhelming favorite, who defied the pressure of his opponent’s strengths and even competing in their field of specialty, Machio Proteen, stands victorious!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as I was concerned, it was a predictable turn of events.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if it’s the same for everyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, we fought the first and second rounds, but we were almost unscathed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You look like you’ve got a lot of leeway aye, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, far from being the bottom of your power, we haven’t shown even half of your ability yet, so of course, aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the top four were decided, we went out to the arena and were introduced to everyone once again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While the cheers loudly rang out, Wacha next to me asked me in a whisper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s the same for you, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, that’s not the case, aye. My fighting is a matter of experience and depth of knowledge, and if I make a mistake, you never know what could have happened, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wonder? And it’s not as easy as it sounds, either, right? I broke out in a cold sweat when I saw Jawara’s technique in the second round. I don’t know about the first round.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With our next opponent, we were having a conversation as if sounding each other out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re …… big… Machio”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you talking about height?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you…… have a lover?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m not worthy of one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re thick.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… are you talking about the arms?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to see it. I’d like to see you all puffed up”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You want me to pose? That’s fine, sometimes I show them off to the young ones in the orphanage.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to touch it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why don’t we do it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re going to battle in the semifinals, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The conversation next to us, was weird.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it just me, or does it seem like the conversation is going well, but somehow not meshing together?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I the only one who feels chills?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not only the fighting style… Earth, you’re surprisingly different from your parents, who are just simple-minded and rambunctious, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? ………… tte, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was taken aback by the conversation next to me, Wacha unexpectedly muttered something that caught me off guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, I raised my voice, and for a moment the entire venue amicably gazed at me, and I hurriedly closed my mouth with my hand, but … this guy …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, he has connections to the outside world, so naturally, he would know about me… didn’t this old man want to hide it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I noticed, 94,000 drills… Even though we are aiming for 1 million, we are still growing… thank you. 906,000 left. When I noticed the cumulative total, I was in 263rd place, so 262 to go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even in autumn, I would like to continue to do my best while taking measures against the heat of my heart with Super Naked Biz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, tomorrow there is “15th Anniversary Event for Let’s be Novelists”, and I will go because I was elected. I would like to report what kind of event it was.
