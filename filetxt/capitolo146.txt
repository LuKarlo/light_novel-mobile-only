 [Now, the semifinals of the chosen men! Facing off, the supernova and the veteran warrior. Truly, this is a composition of the new era and tradition!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and Wacha. We face each other in our signature stances
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I flicker. And step lightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Wacha’s stance was, contrary to me, with his dominant hand in front of him, pointing at me with his fingers spread out instead of clenching his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The dominant hand upfront… Southpaw style. And by having the right in front, it makes landing hits with your left more difficult.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Southpaw style. I never really thought about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hard to hit with the left? I can strike the guy! Without restraint!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I can’t overcome a bit of difficulty, I won’t make it in the world ahead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, do show us what you got! Reveal the outcome of this showdown! Let the semifinals…… Begin!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the start signal, I jumped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To land hits in a difficult situation, as much as you want, is proof that you can dominate the world with your left hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Flicker】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huacha!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Left. It bent like a whip, and carved Wacha at an irregular trajectory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, unlike the opponents in the first and second rounds, Wacha was not hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if it’s irregular, your left is… always aiming at my head from the front aye! If so, this much!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the right hand put out in front, he was fending off the lefts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Certainly, this is the merit of the southpaw stance, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, what if I don’t come at you head-on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dominating on the left does not mean stopping still and just punching like an idiot with your left hand to win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You have to be able to put together a plan to apply the left, which is your weapon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Magical Footwork”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the large arena, I accelerate and move in a circle around Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, he doesn’t seem able to keep up with my footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don in the middle, inviting me in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Goose Step】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, aye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I move my shoulder slightly as I accelerate into Wacha’s blind spot, diagonally behind him, and released the left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Wacha, who had predicted my dive from the blind spot, reacted immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He tried to put a counter on my left side with the finger jab that he showed in the first round…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gotcha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never underestimated Wacha, either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I was properly reading what was being read.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The left I was trying to release was a feint.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stopped just before, and a rather simple right straight finger jab from Wacha was released, then I reintroduced the left I stopped to cover that right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Left Cross】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With this, it’s in……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just kidding, aye♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when it came to reading the undersurface, Wacha had more experience than I did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you read up to the left cross?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A finger jab that I thought was straight. But suddenly, his right elbow bent, changing the trajectory of my cross counter!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Cross Counter Return】 aye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, aiming at my defenseless jaw, Wacha stretched his piercing left… toward my eyeball. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuuka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Upper body evasion. Avoid with the 【Great Demon Swayback】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, ooh… I thought I could cut the area around the eyelids a little without a direct hit, but… you have extraordinary dynamic vision…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course. I’ve been secretly training hard ever since I lost thoroughly to Jamdi’el in Magical Vision Training!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Improving the basic ability of dynamic visual acuity, eye movement, and peripheral vision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without these last three months of training, that might have been a bit dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I was using this left three months ago…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And after three months, now… I can hit lefts like this, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I resume my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took some distance with the backstep and flickered again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha also tried to get poised again with the same stance as before, but … it’s not the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This left aye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It looked like a flicker, but then I changed my stance, and it’s just a straight left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The left is the basics of the basics, no gimmicks or anomalies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Wacha, who would have seen the trajectory and rhythm of my Flicker, was a moment too late in reacting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Habu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora! There are still a lot of shots… hnn?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got in. On the left… nuh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, there was no response. This is…… a neck twist! He twisted his neck in the same direction as my straight left to reduce damage… and slipped away!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fui~, really… I can’t let my guard down for even a moment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Could he, just like me, perform this sort of defense?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is not something just anyone can do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the power of the trained eye…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis intuition based on experience… is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Avoiding direct hits with experience and intuition that I did not have.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s calm words made me chuckle inwardly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe… you’re… amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar described Wacha as, “having more power, speed, and overall strength than I do”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, even as we face each other like this, I felt the same way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar also said this about Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Technique…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man of great skill. So much so that Tre’ainar praised him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, that’s why he said that there was no better opponent when going out into the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By all possible means, I’ll have you take one left shot with all my might!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, go easy on me, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll hit you. Without fail. I began carving out the steps again, building them up to hit the left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [There is… no direct hit from either side! By a skin, by the flesh, they are fighting each other with merely a paper thin world between them! Wh, what we are witnessing here is, al, already, a, a hit landed… no, that didn’t connect either! Wow, I was sure… I saw it, didn’t I? Ah, ugh, ah…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unusually, the host was unable to calmly explain the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the audience forgot their cheers and jeers and became silent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host was finally speechless before long, perhaps everyone was staring breathlessly, fascinated by the paper thin offense and defense, and before he knew it, only the sound of the air being blown by our attacks echoed in the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rugby World Cup! Japan has defeated Ireland, the no.2 in the world ranking! The excitement breakthrough, piercing the heavens, I couldn’t stand it any longer and wrote about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong! It’s not a miraculous Giant Killing anymore, it’s real ability! It’s impossible not to write about this historic moment!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, during Anikki’s college days… the yearling who once beat Anikki’s team in a practice match against the University of the East Sea, is now the captain of the Japanese national team and has beaten a world contender.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know I’m halfway through, and this is a little shorter than usual, but please forgive me! I can’t sleep with all this excitement unless I update two chapters today!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For those who aren’t interested in rugby at all, it may not really matter, but please forgive me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nuoooooooh!
</div>
