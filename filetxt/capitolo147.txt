 “Ara, well, oh my, this time it’s that one? Somehow, what a really amazing fight!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the highest seat, the voice of a carefree goddess could be heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, I would be distracted, but now I’m not distracted in the slightest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufufu, splendid. Earth Lagann. With only left-fist techniques, thou skills do not fall short of Wacha’s… I am increasingly delighted.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although the former member of the legendary Six Supremacy also liked it, now is not the time to be pleased about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A bit more… even so… I can’t get it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m trying to hit the target, but I can’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 High-speed lefts lash out while tossing him around with my steps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as if he was reading my movements ahead of time, Wacha handled them, and just when I thought I’d hit him, he’s gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My jab can’t be evaded after seeing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this guy could evade it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To think that he’s avoiding all this by anticipating my movements with only his experience and intuition, he’s quite formidable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because there was no strategy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’m not just running around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Howacha! Howa, 【Arcane True Zenith Jeet Kune Do】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I’m not careful, he’ll land a counter in between my left-handed strikes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, feet, elbows, fingers, back fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He also attacked with the parts of the body that I can’t use.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess this is what it means to have a lot to draw from.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Howacha! 【Arcane True Zenith Short Strong(Fajin)】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Left Corkscrew】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My left and Wacha’s right clashed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In destructive power… I’m on top!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oruaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My left side, which was driven by the screw, was more penetrative and destructive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pushed by my fist, Wacha’s upper body leaned back, throwing him off balance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right here, I’ll be able to close the gap between us… but… anyway, it’s an invitation, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Demolition Fist】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Parrying】… kara~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uo, you defended against that too?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Chopping Left】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, the moment I closed the gap, he countered with a straight middle thrust.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I knew it was coming, so I parried with my left hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then it’s the same thing all over again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah… no hit! It’s a dizzying technical battle as they repeatedly attack and defend at the same time! No, it’s already amazing that Earth can contend with Wacha in a technical battle!? But Wacha isn’t being overpowered by Earth’s youth and vigor! They’re evenly matched! Such an amazing match!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother, fight on fight on, fiiiiight oooon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big Brother, give it your all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s see you give a cheer Big Sister Sadiz~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “G, go for it… fure fure, go for it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither of us could land a decisive blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, our faces still remain clean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, the current situation is even, as the host said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha he is overestimating our chances aye”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha chuckled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason was simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such a shame, I’m attacking with every part of my body, whereas my opponent is attacking with only one left hand… I’m appalled to hear that we are evenly matched, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, using only my left, I haven’t lifted the ban on the right yet. I haven’t even head-butted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha himself probably knows what that meant in this evenly matched situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t worry. I’ll be serious, but the theme is just the left.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha. I don’t know if it’s okay to feel at ease or if it’s better to be depressed, so subtle aye…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, I have decided to stick with the left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I don’t hit the right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until this match, that is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… your fists are too technical aye… you…… why don’t you use a sword aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that point, Wacha asked me during the interval of the battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That question, anyone who knew about “my identity” would be curious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My father may have been a hero, but that doesn’t mean I’m his successor.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why ‘this here’ is my path, my choice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha seemed surprised that I am the son of a hero, but did not use a magic sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I showed Wacha my fist and taught him my style again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… It’s not just a rebellious phase… apparently, you really don’t want to choose the path of a magic swordsman… well, that’s probably why your bare-hands have reached such a high level aye…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, somehow, Wacha nodded as if he was convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… you…… seem to know my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’d have to be crazy not to know aye”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re not hiding it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no point in playing dumb with you, aye… and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… hmm, no… yeah…… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also asked about Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Wacha seemed to think a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I have some history with your father… so I thought…… I’d share that destiny with you aye…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Destiny?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Umm… if you’re not following the same path as your father, but walking your own path… hmm, because holding a grudge is really unbecoming… I’m at a loss aye. You see, the organization I belonged to was crushed, and the boss was tossed into prison by the hero…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don’t just know my father, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An acquaintance? History? What the heck……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are the goddess and the High Priestess watching over there aware?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know a goddess, but… the High Priestess knows of course aye. On top of that, they are letting me roam free… that… makes it easier to detect the movements of …… ‘that man’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I glanced up, Jamdi’el was looking down with a fearless smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, who was ‘that man’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hero… history…… the final key… there’s a lot of stuff that concern you aye… it can’t be helped. For now, I’ll just focus on the fight aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha had a lot of doubts and thoughts, but now he’s ready to focus on this fight and faced me again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oh-uh, what’s this? The two seem to be talking with some serious expressions… however, they must have come to a conclusion! They’ll clash with their fists once more! All right, show off more of that high-quality battle!! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Uoooh, good, do it!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t really understand our conversation, but cheers rose as we were about to start fighting again to our hearts content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the crowd wanted us to “Stop messing around and fight”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it can’t be helped…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, I’ll focus.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are many things that I was curious about, but I nodded my head in agreement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… I thought I’d let you experience a little more of me, but… that’s it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because I’m… really going to get ‘focused’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My body was warm enough, and my nerves and senses were sharpened high the high-level of attack and defense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously? You’ll use the right, aye? Or maybe…… the High Priestess is curious… the secret technique, Break――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no. Still just the left. But with the left… I’ll hit you with a left that is more focused.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not the breakthrough. Not with magic, but… nerves…… and mind…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I can “get in”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll show you. The ‘zone’… and…… end it in an instant.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I went into the Extreme Concentration Mode.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An exciting morning. But today, as I said yesterday morning, I’m going to the 15th anniversary event of Syosetu, so I can’t update two chapters, please forgive me.
