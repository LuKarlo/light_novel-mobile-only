<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is a problem aye. The eyes of a young man who burns with youth, purely focused on improving himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he looks at me like that, it will be even more shameful for me to link him with my fate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, there was no resentment or hatred towards him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The organization being destroyed by the hero, Hiro, was simply them reaping what they sow, and to complain about it would be lashing out with unjustified resentment aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, it had nothing to do with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey…… Wacha. Is there anyone out on the island who seems usable?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There are a few aye”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. I was a little concerned about harboring that woman, but thanks to her opening a strange dojo, I have more people I can use, and it will help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Dojo aye. I’m also getting stronger aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The country isolated from the Union as a secluded nation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, if you flee there, no one can catch you no matter what crimes you have committed outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It has been more than ten years since I came to this island country as an “unofficial tour conductor” who connected the inside and outside of this island country within the organization. Nowadays, no one doubted me being a resident of this country aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, in Cacretale, it was considered a crime for residents to leave the island and for people from outside to come to the island.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So there I was, aye. I made connections by bribing people at the center of the nation, and as long as I was an intermediary, I was able to unofficially connect the island to the outside world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, those days changed when a man, who was a brother to the boss of the organization and one of the Six Supremacy of the Demon King Army, requested that we sheltered a woman and her baby on the island.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The woman was also one of the Six Supremacy who left their names in history. And the baby she brought with her was so scared for her life that I didn’t even check her background aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while she was in hiding, the woman instigated the people of this country to create an environment where she could move easily and conveniently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was not originally from this country, I moved around in a position that was convenient for me aye, but before I knew it, the people thought that I was ‘The High Priestess’ oldest disciple’ aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, the ministers of the old regime, who knew my identity but had tolerated me, were also dismissed and no longer bribed me, and I was okay with that aye…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, lately there’s this half-demon kid who’s been rampaging against the organization in Cantidan… a brat called Bro… was he using… the Arcane True Zenith Style?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Bro… aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After all, he’s a Cacretale brat. What’s going on? You didn’t send him, did you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No aye! Probably… on his own…… maybe Bro doesn’t know anything about the organization, and it’s just a coincidence…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, geez… hey, the executives of the organization will start to move. That brat’s done for already, so stick with the plan, got it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The problem was the collapse of the old regime.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The country of Cacretale still had no intention of opening its doors to the world, but instead, it had become relaxed about its residents leaving the island, and allowing visitors to the island, as long as they were introduced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the system that was supposed to condemn them has collapsed aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I realized that I would have to discontinue my job as a tour conductor on this island, another incident occurred aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The organization was destroyed by the hero, Hiro, and the Knights of the Imperial City, and the boss was also captured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, now I no longer have the organization to return to, so I’ve really become just another resident of the island.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now I’m just a tame person, keeping in touch with the boss’ brother, and the sisters looking out for Jamdi’el who was in hiding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For my life, I don’t know where I went wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fell into such a situation, and for the rest of my life, what will I live for aye? To train? To fight?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The son of Hiro, the hero who crushed the organization and caught the boss, appeared in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I understand that it’s wrong to hold a grudge, I can’t say that I don’t have feelings about him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, the man who actually confronted me was so genuinely gleeful about my skills that it made me feel even sorrier to bring up such a connection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it was tactless aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all, his eyes have changed even more aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a really focused expression, as if he seriously meant to defeat me aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I must respond to this aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not about the organization or my life. On equal ground, as a man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Finger Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Use my full strength. And, I released the fastest most merciless attack at the eyes of the young man in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure he’s aiming for a counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By his previous strategy, it would be a cross counter. However, I had already defeated that with a cross-counter return earlier aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only other thing I can think of is that he will sway back and hit me when my body is fully extended.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wouldn’t be able to absorb the impact and would take heavy damage. Since I’m stepping forward, even a head slip won’t be enough aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I still dared to go for it aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it is a cross counter, I’ll return the cross counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it’s a counter from an evasion on the sway, I’ll hit his body with my left fist aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I also have a risk of failure, but if it is only one left blow, I will grit my teeth and endure it aye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come on, aye!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come on, aye!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll endure……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Didn’t… come?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no sign of a counter or feeling of avoiding it with a sway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He just looked at my finger jab with a very focused expression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, contrary to my expectations, Earth shifted his body slightly and avoided my finger jab with minimal movement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he did not avoid and immediately go for the infight from the step-in, he just avoided it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What was he thinking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But since he didn’t come, I pulled back my right finger jab and without pause, with a left――――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaga!? ……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the moment, a shock that I could not comprehend hit my jaw… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? Why, am I… before I knew what was happening, both my knees were on the ground…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [What?! S, see here, what was that!? Wacha is down!? In a complete change from his previous offense and defense, he caught Wacha in the jaw with a normal left flash!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? My jaw with a left? Why? I couldn’t see…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufufu… Hahahahahaha! Hahahaha! I never imagined thou could do this… while still a mere human being… to competently aim at that point?? As one would expect… the final key! Inheriting the power of the Great Demon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el…? Why are you laughing in such a good mood aye?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, on the contrary, the audience was puzzled by my current state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why am I kneeling down on the ground?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t know aye. I know he got my chin, but I don’t know the moment at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you see Jamdi’el? Do you know what happened aye?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, how many here would realize? The Finger Jab Wacha pulled back… he didn’t match that finger jab… not even right after the end of the opponent’s strike… but when the opponent finished hitting and “pulled” the fist back, it was hidden behind the opponent’s arm and driven in… it’s simply an invisible punch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When pulling the finger jab…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is what I was able to hit by entering the zone… the【Great Demon Phantom Punch】.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… fanto… mu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh… I see… maybe the life I didn’t know what I was living for… that’s what appeared before me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’d like to thank you. For the first time, I was able to ‘enter’ in an actual battle… I was able to ‘grasp’ the extreme timing … you brought it out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been stuck in the same place …… with the organization as an excuse… but this young man was trying to jump out into the world… perhaps…… I lived to this day… for this young man…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah, he can’t stand! And Wacha just fell down to the ground… faint! He’s fainted! A flash on the left, like a bolt of lightning! A new era and history. Today, the decision goes to the new age! Earth Lagann, is headed for the finals with flying colors!!]
</div>

 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I went to the Narou event. Hundreds of people were gathered at the symposium-like hall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anniki was about to be seized by a security guard at the entrance for some reason, but was able to evade with Magical Steps and enter the venue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the day of the event, we did the following:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - An open discussion between writers (I had nothing to do with it) and voice actors in charge of radio
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - At the karaoke of voice actors, everyone brought penlights HIYOOO
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - A reading session of Narou novels (I didn’t care about it) by voice actors. A Villainess Engagement Annulment Event
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Listened to Narou radio broadcast on the spot
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was all.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
