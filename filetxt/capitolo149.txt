<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as I thought, sparring and actual combat are different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The deep and high-dimensional reading and fighting opponents with a variety of techniques heightened my concentration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I was able to successfully perform the Zone and the Great Demon Phantom Punch by my own will, not by chance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Being able to succeed in an actual battle gave me the utmost confidence, and I was able to gain a knack or a feeling that would lead me to the next step.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How was it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If tis only the first time, tis a fluke. Ability comes only after succeeding twice in a row. And, I shall admit that you have completely made it your own after three consecutive successes. I will not approve it with a 50/50 all or nothing success rate, do keep that in mind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, you won’t acknowledge me if I only succeed once? Now I’m fired up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar seemed to be in a somewhat good mood, so maybe he approved of me a little? I thought to myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, on to the second semifinal match! The rising star of the new era has already qualified for the finals. The winner of this match will earn the right to compete for the top spot against the rising star! Danchok, who landed in prison as a criminal, has crawled his way back up to challenge for the honorable title! However, standing in his way is the undisputed giant star of the Arcane True Zenith School! What will be the outcome of this clash?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve made it to the finals, and soon it’ll be Mr. Machio’s semifinal match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were cheering for Mr. Machio, so the sisters didn’t come down to celebrate my victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But either way, I didn’t want to lose my concentration, so this is fine for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could hardly wait to fight in the finals. I want to show the difference from three months ago soon. My blood was boiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, the finals won’t be my last…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oyah~, Machio and Danchok are talking about something… What was that? Tastes? Whip? Pants…… what are they talking about? I’m not sure what that’s all about, but Danchok is proposing the nature of the match to Machio. However, Machio, who has fought so far in accordance with the rules of his opponent, is reluctant this time…… eh?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as always, Mr. Machio. I mean, why don’t you just punch him and get it over with…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why don’t you accept this match with me, Machio!? You… you, is this… manliness not your type!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, why would you decide that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh!?? Huh? No, no, no … eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar… did I hear wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Apologies. I also thought that was an auditory hallucination, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you mean? You’re fighting, aren’t you? What’s with that kind of development, why did such a conversation start?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L, let’s go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『U, uh huh!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was curious about it. I thought I would work on my concentration or meditation until the final, but I was curious about how things were unfolding, so I rushed back to the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there was Danchok with a serious look on his face, holding a pair of white pants in his hand and his upper body naked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio. You’re so domineering, muscular, thick, big and robust… popular with everyone! You would be popular with women! But, you are still single despite your age! That means, you’re not interested in women! You must be interested in guys! Isn’t that right?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, that’s not it at all… what is the logic behind that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Machio looked unusually stunned and dumbfounded. No, everyone in this place must have thought that when Mr. Machio’s made his retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Danchok continued.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, Machio. Are you saying there is already a woman in your heart?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Machio’s eyebrows twitched slightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I naturally looked towards Elder Sis Tsukshi who was in the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Machio… ugh, i, is that so~? Machio has… someone he likes already…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, her eyes were moistening with a look full of anxiety and sorrow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz and the sisters put their hands on her shoulders, looking worried about Elder Sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as a matter of fact, I was wondering about it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio would be quite popular, but why isn’t he married?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… not worthy of being loved by anyone… because in the civil war… with my hands… so many people… my hands are no longer―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadly, Mr. Machio tried to mutter… at that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You think you’re so cool, Machio Proteen! If you think your hands are dirty, I’m going to kill you myself, you bastard!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Danchok, who had a decent physique, though not as big as Mr. Machio, punched him in the face with his strong arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than avoiding it, it was unavoidable, and it seemed that Mr. Machoi didn’t think he would be attacked, so the reaction was delayed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Danchok…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Mr. Machio was surprised by Danchok, who left him stunned with a slightly swollen cheek where he was hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Danchok…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to ask you. Once I committed a crime, I went to prison, my body and mind were broken and defiled… but I finished my sentence and got out… don’t I have the right to be happy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what are you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Answer me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I don’t… think so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then what about you? Rather, have you ever been a criminal?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Danchok’s words and questions suddenly spoke of his sins and his past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does a criminal have no right to be happy, even if he atones for his crime?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you, the man that men fall in love with… and who, unlike me, has saved, protected, and smiled at more people than you have killed, still insinuates that you don’t deserve to be loved… then that country should be destroyed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Danchok…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Weird. Why are you having such a serious conversation while holding white pants in your hand?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the atmosphere of the venue was heavy, and no one could get a retort in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s because the people who live in this country have known Mr. Machio for a long time and know him well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, Mr. Machio seemed unable to admit it easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Mr. Machio!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? …… Tsukshi?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi shouted from the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shedding tears, she screamed with her emotions laid bare.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We are… what we are today thanks to Mr. Machio! Mr. Machio helped us… and gave us warmth after we lost our parents in the civil war … taught me the warmth of family… protected us… that Mr. Machio… we are very grateful for his kindness and support!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only Elder Sis Tsukshi, but the sisters around her nodded with smiles, saying that the whole felt the same way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Mr. Machio! If you don’t stop that, I’ll never forgive you! Come on, tell him, Amae! You like Mr. Machio, don’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un? Un! I love you, uncle!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio, we’re the same! Please think about your own happiness!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me too! So do the children in the orphanage!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kora, Machio! You’re big and bold, how long are you going to just sit around!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s our hero!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whole venue was united, and shouted their thoughts to one man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was confused and dismayed by the words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone… but…… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~…… utterly…… pathetic. I chased after such a man’s ass… seriously.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it seemed that Mr. Machio couldn’t nod, as if he couldn’t change his mind easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the exasperated Danchok exhaled a sigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Machio. In this tournament… there seems to be a reason why you can’t lose… but is there something you want from winning?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides the honor of winning, there is a huge prize money to win… are you trying to buy something you want?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!? …… wh, what are…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Mr. Machio choked on Danchok’s question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, Mr. Machio told me. “There’s a reason I can’t lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that Mr. Machio simply hated losing, but it wasn’t like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Mr. Machio wins, he’ll get Kron as a supplementary prize… but he doesn’t know that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, inevitably, what he wants is the prize money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don’t think Mr. Machio is the type of person who covets money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Elder Sis Tsukshi doesn’t seem to know why Mr. Machio wants money, and she gave him a wondering look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I will take any man I desire, even by force. But any man I fall for will be thoroughly investigated and planned for in many ways. You know that? I know that you’ve accumulated all the money you earn from day labor and other avenues… to purchase land… you’re trying to create a school that everyone can attend for free!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Hey, hey… why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? School? Free? Oh, but then I remembered… before…… Elder Sis Tsukshi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――we’re, almost all of us, war orphans… our livelihood comes from church donations, but it’s not like we can afford that much luxury… of course, not everyone’s tuition can be paid… so, at least if only for the future of Karui, who is the second youngest, and Amae, who is the youngest… that’s the way it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were many sisters in the church who were the same age as me. But Karui was the only one who attended the Wizarding School.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s very kind of you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no… It’s just self-satisfaction…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was no use.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment they knew Mr. Machio’s plan and his thoughts, which no one knew before, the people in the audience were in tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio… such a…… school…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi, who couldn’t bear it, collapsed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The kindness of Mr. Machio, which should have already been known, exceeded the imagination of Elder Sis Tsukshi, who had known him for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, you’ve ruined the mood… Machio “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Danchok…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m done. I give up. It’s my loss.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Danchok said “Good grief” and declared his surrender.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not interested in your ass anymore. A soft life surrounded by girls and children would suit you better… don’t be so hard on yourself… make your own wishes come true, and I’m sure you’ll be happy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Da, Danchok!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ciao~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After making it to the semifinals, Danchok declared that he had no intention of fighting anymore, said what he wanted to say, and then turned his back and walked away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He raised his hand for the last time, and said goodbye without looking back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, after a while of silence, that even the host was speechless, Elder Sis Tsukshi finally jumped out of the audience because she couldn’t contain herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She jumped down, and Elder Sis Tsukshi ran out to Mr. Machio as soon as she landed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, without hesitation, she dove into Mr. Machio’s massive chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu, Tsukshi… w, wait, I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh-uh. I don’t think I can do that anymore~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter what Machio says, I’m not leaving anymore~. If Machio’s hands are dirty and he can’t touch anyone, I’ll go touch him~! I’ve also made up my mind~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw Elder Sis Tsukshi’s tears for the first time, with a smile and powerful resolve towards the one she loved from the bottom of her heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Enough, I’m… going to make Machio happy~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Tsuk…… shi…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio also looked very emotional and turned over his depression on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi continued to hug Mr. Machio tightly, and never let go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gradually, the audience, which had been quiet, began to shout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Mr. Machio! I’ll get angry if it’s not elder sister!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle, Big Sister! Do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Machio, be happy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “MA-CHI-O! MA-CHI-O! MA-CHI-O!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words directed at one man. “Be happy”. The word echoed forever, and finally Mr. Machio’s eyes were moistening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man who was so hard on himself and did not think about his own happiness was loved by so many people who wished for him to be happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [What an unexpected turn of events! But the words Danchok left behind were exactly what everyone in this country was thinking! Everyone thinks so! Machio saved my life! Thank you, Machio! That’s why I hope! Now it’s your turn to be happy! In the end of the competition, it’s not for glory, honor, or money that they competed with each other in arms! It’s happiness!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””UUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [An unexpected ending. But the best ending! Thank you, Machio! And be happy! With this, the current Arcane True Zenith Fighting Tournament… huh? What? It feels like we’re forgetting something…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host, who had been at a loss for words, finally spoke up, followed by a shout from everyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so the tournament was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu, WAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIITT! Don’t just end iiiiiiiiiit! The final is not over yet! Me! Me! You haven’t had your match with me yet! I mean, what the hell is going on here!? How’d it turn out like this??!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [No way… I had forgotten about the final…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m allowed to cry about this, aren’t I? In a different way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
