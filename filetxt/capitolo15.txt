 『Now, once you are flexible enough we shall begin the ladder training. Now, I shall provide a demonstration.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar lays the ladder to the ground. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King’s training finally begins.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, first stand before the ladder then step in the square grid between the ladder’s scaffolding…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jump quickly while aligning both feet and move forward. Jump straight. Do not step on the ladder, step in it, and land only within the squares.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… The Great Demon King jumped forward all Totototo with both feet together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, you carry on as such.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『When you’re done, return to the first point, and then move forward with your legs aligned and jumping left and right. The trick is to jump with both feet and land on both feet. Do not land to a single foot alone.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once, the legendary Great Demon King who made the world tremble jumped back and forth with both feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Next, one leg and the other, and then open both legs and jump a third time. Next is the other side, so, repeat the opening and closing, Hopscotch, Hopscotch, with a proper rhythm.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had driven mankind into the depths of fear and was intoxicated by the cries of tragedy and blood. The brutal and outrageous Demon King is playing ‘Hopscotch’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And this time, Hop, Hop and quick…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… o-oh… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, I’ll be cursed to death if I laugh now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Out, in, out, in, out, and slalom with both feet…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Osu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Next on one leg, slalom.』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this is the Great Demon King shaking his ass and zigzaging♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Skipping, one, two, three! One, two, three!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bu, Gur, u… hehehehehe…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Skip Run dance ♪ of the Great Demon King!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you motivated or are you nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooottttt!!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And yet your attention was led astray!? Hehehe, do laugh!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so, Tre’ainar’s patience finally ran out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You said you would take this seriously.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I know! I’m going to do that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I understand. It’s no use getting angry at my behavior when you’re diligently teaching me how to be my true self.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when seeing that Great Demon King skip and Hopscotch in front of you, laughter is inevitable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might be the first man in history to witness the Great Demon King skipping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Honestly… All right? This ladder training is not only a warm-up, tis effective for improving basic skills!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes! Tis apparent I need to explain the effects first.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having said that, while I was a little blushing and angry, Tre’ainar taught me the effect of this strange thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『With this ladder training, we can train your ability to quickly step, stop and turn, and even slow down, turn back, and accelerate. Do you know what that means?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, let’s ignore the previous skip. I won’t ridicule him anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I’ll earnestly give it my full attention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Improvement in functionality can be obtained according to the words of this Tre’ainar… That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does that mean I’m going to use my body better?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To be more precise, it is to increase the reaction speed of nerves and muscles.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nerve and muscle reaction speed? I get it, I don’t get it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Humans and demons both transmit commands from the brain through the nerves to muscles… Good reflexes mean that the transmission response speed between brain, nerve, and muscle is fast. This ladder training, slowing down, turning back, and accelerating in a narrow, limited space, doesn’t work if the instructions are not communicated to the muscles efficiently, even if the brain knows it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… see”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By coordinating the brain, nerves, and muscles, you can move your body as you please, faster and more accurately, and as a result, your motor skills improve. Furthermore…… the faster your reaction speed … the faster your magic is triggered.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was quite interesting and frustrating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed to be a silly discipline, but now that you say that, I felt that it would be effective.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, will magic will be faster?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In combat, tis common for your body to be unable to keep up with your mind. Gaps and time lags that the body can’t keep up with the image thought by the brain may be the difference between life and death on the battlefield. To fill that gap and move as imagined in the mind. This is “the technique that can be acquired”. With that in mind, take this ladder training seriously.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Move the body according to the image drawn by the mind. However, I was convinced that it was surprisingly difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a vague image of my father’s sword, I kept swinging my sword. For me who never had a clear image of what I wanted to do, this training method is totally unheard of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…somehow, I’m beginning to understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, Then, continue! One, two, three! One, two, three!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” O-One, two, three!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Speak up! Learn the rhythm first by speaking out! Engrave it on your body! Don’t be shy and raise your voice! HopScotch! HopScotch!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Osu! Ho, Ho, HopScotch! HopScotch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Raise your arms properly, knees high, maintain a fast and steady rhythm, and KEEP.A.SHARP.PACE!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, if you take it seriously, this is surprisingly difficult and hard, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, depending on the step, if you try to do it quickly, it becomes awkward, your body collapses, or you step on a ladder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, this might improve the functionality like Tre’ainar says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『OK, as you get used to it, let us gradually increase the difficulty level. I shall instruct you on what steps you will take from the outside.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu. You mean I’m going to have to do exactly what I’m told?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course, that’s not all. I will indicate steps and… also direct the magic attributes.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Magic……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Precisely. Simply apply a little basic magic at your fingertips. When I say ‘fire’, all you have to do is light a small flame. However, you will activate the magic of the indicated attribute at the same time while doing the steps as instructed from now on.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time it’s not just the steps, it’s also magic? Well, if only basic magic is enough, what will it do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then proceed, cross-step with lightning!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, cross, oh, that? Whoa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Slow! Next HopScotch of the wind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, HopSco- Aah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Something wrong, why is there no magic? Next, Carioca of the wind!』 [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The wind, all right, get out, uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, do not stumble!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… No, hey, this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-What is this, so difficult!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I try to step, I can’t release my magic, and if you try to activate magic, I can’t step.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar is smiling as he expected that I would have a hard time is this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Naturally. Step while doing something else. Magic while performing another task. That is, to attempt separate tasks simultaneously uses considerable nerves and disrupts the reaction. Those who are untrained are biased towards one action or the other.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bias… Or…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For instance, with you and a lady’s bosom… Consider this, could you study magic mathematics while admiring her breasts? Would the breast not deprive you of your concentration rather than calculation?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Okay, that’s easy to understand… Sure…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the same. In addition, the style of 【Magic Sword】 is essentially established by balancing both sword and magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He gave me a very easy-to-understand example that suits me, and I was thoroughly convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s true of the Magic Sword that I’ve been imitating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis possible to simply imbue magic into your sword before the battle and swing it around, but… while waving a sword, tis difficult to quickly and flexibly adapt the magic according to the situation. However, if you can acquire this, the quality of movement in combat will be dramatically improved, and the accuracy of magic will increase a well. The more accurate it is, the better the quality and power of magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more you listen the more you hear, I realized how shallow I was without thinking about what I’ve done so far, and at the same time I understand how much this seemingly silly training is worth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing, ladder training… It’s impressive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, this is the 【Magical Ladder】 training that I devised!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite the name, I had no choice but to be honestly impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I can do this properly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you understand? This warm-up is to be done every day from now on. If you get used to this, you should be able to see a slightly different landscape in battle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, skip the wind!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time in my life, I performed the skip- run dance in order to get seriously strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, I am always indebted to you. I’m going to post early today because I’m up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you to those who always report typographical errors because my writing is childish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m rereading it before I post it myself, but it’s very helpful because there’s something missing by all means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And today’ overall rating exceeded 10000. I am grateful for the fact that I was able to break through one line and to have met many people through my work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, I’m basically able to put my impressions and comments into everyone, so please come and see me if you feel like it. Twitter is also fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, thank you in the future.

 [S1] Holupaminit! Shouldn’t he be unable to do this? He’s a ghost!!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] [Hopscotch] is a popular children’s playground game in which toss a small object onto a pattern of rectangle outlines on the ground and then hop and skip through the spaces to retrieve the object.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] [Slalom] is a side by side pattern of movement in order to avoid approaching obstacles!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] [Carioca ] is a variation of the Brazilian Samba dance. So he may be referring to a particular step in the dance that is often used in training drills.
