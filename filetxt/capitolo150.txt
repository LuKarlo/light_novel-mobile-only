 [Eh~, uh~, everyone, umm……… please don’t go home yet! The final isn’t over yet… eh, emm…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host, who had been shouting out loud as he wished, was now at a loss for words for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed shaken up over his blunder of forgetting about the final, even though he was in charge of the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah~, Machio… um…… is that all right? Are you fine with having the final like this?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No problem. Or rather, I haven’t had a decent fight yet today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [I, I see. Then, Tsukushi… I’m sorry, this moment is full of happiness, but…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes, th, that’s right! Uh huh…… I’ll have to apologize to Earth… tte, that’s right… in fact, I really must have Earth win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [O, okay! Well then, ladies and gentlemen! Let’s carry on straight to the Finals! It’s a confrontation that is just right for the final, between the Supernova and the Superhuman! So, l, let’s get excited!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””o, ooooooooooh~~~””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the voices raised from the very audience were very subtle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To begin with, it seemed that everyone was already satisfied, so to put it bluntly, there was a redundant atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Felt like everyone thought “Just give Mr. Machio the victory already”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that… guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was popular with people all over the country. He was also popular with women, loved, supported, and recognized by the entire country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was truly a national hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, what about me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph. Hmph. Ke, ke, keh! Fine, Mr. Machio. You should be surrounded by everyone, being wowed and flirting. On the other hand, I can’t read the mood, so I don’t care if Mr. Machio loses and the entire country gets depressed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the corridor in front of the arena entrance, I was sulking while hitting my fists on the wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, from the excitement of the semi-finals earlier, I sensed that the whole country was looking forward to Mr. Machio’s victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, hold that temper. Do not disrupt your concentration.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buuuuuut!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah, uh huh… I understand. Hah~, so pitiful…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was unusually sympathetic to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made me more of a sissy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, at the same time, there was something boiling up from inside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keh… fine… doesn’t matter… I’ve acted in response to someone’s support… but I’ve never won because of someone else’s support.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. In fact, when I was in the Imperial Capital, I regarded the voices around me as nothing more than noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A total away match?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can claim to be competent only if you win under such conditions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll do it, you bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Somehow, tis truly pitiful…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I barked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the start, I was going to win the tournament. I came with the intention of defeating every opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, I forced myself to think that it would be a blessing in disguise if I could fight to my heart’s content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be too cynical. I know you’re all full of emotions towards Machio, but no one will think less of you, let alone wish you to lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tch… why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just then, I heard a familiar voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it? It seems that the love of Elder Sis Tsukshi, who adores you, is coming true, so why don’t you celebrate with everyone in the audience?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why are you here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could tell who it was by just hearing their voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked back while clicking my tongue, I found Sadiz there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, the whole place is on Mr. Machio’s side. Do you feel sympathy for me, who was forgotten even in the finals in the first place? Is it pity? In any case, I’ll do it my own way, so get back to your seat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I understood that I was just venting my anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than anything else, Sadiz showed up when I was already frustrated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but take it out on her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t control the rebellious spirit of “I’ll do it myself” anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe it’s sympathy or… just that…… I genuinely care more for you… than those two.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I really can’t say. After all, as long as I don’t even know myself yet, it’ll be hard to say anything for sure… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual, Sadiz was apologetic to me no matter what I said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it breaks my heart every time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many times have we repeated this over the last three months?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But today, Sadiz prepared in advance and didn’t back off right away, and finally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “GO…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gou?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, started to blush and fidget a bit, which was unusual for her little moody. It’s all too fresh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t figure out what she was trying to say, so I tilted my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Sadiz looked up as if he had made up her mind…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “GO-GO, Earth GO! FIGHT ON, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… wha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While enduring embarrassment, she shook her pompoms, raised her legs, raised her voice and cheered me on with all her best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I know! You…… you may not like me… and you may find my support annoying… but still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz herself doesn’t understand. Why did she have to support me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, just like the advance preparation time, I’m sure she couldn’t help but feel that “I have to do something”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I just…I told you, I want to graduate … so that’s enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I still couldn’t accept it honestly, but I felt a little more relaxed about the shamefulness of it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, really, enough was enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… still… if you’re willing to do something about it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I can still hope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to go back to the way it used to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How about the boobs, what about our future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… still, the only thing…… I regret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, just like now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――♫Go Go Little man, Go! Lil’ Earth! Go! ♫!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was only one thing I didn’t get, even though she supported me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At the very least, ‘this time’ … please watch through to the end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The power I wield… it’s not about whose technique it was or who I learned it from… it is power that I worked so hard to acquire… so watch me all the way to the end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I couldn’t get her to do that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just wanted you to see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just watch… and?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, that’s right. No more of that …… stuff…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz doesn’t remember. She can’t remember. But I still said it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that the power I wield is the power of the Great Demon King, or something like that, but more purely I want you to see the power I’ve developed… that this is who I am now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I left the Imperial Capital and abandoned my old ties.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, if she’s still getting involved again and I couldn’t shake her off as a hindrance, I’ll tell her that, it would be enough if she would at least do that for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Then, supernova Earth! The chosen man among men, worthy of standing in the finals, come on out!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’ll finish it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Watch me properly! Moreover, I’ll get you to recognize me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It didn’t come true in the previous match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To win the championship. To grasp the glory. To be recognized by everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of it, now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My oh my, such pestilence. Preparations are in good order, in that case… promptly, go! Knock him down!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, my teacher hit my butt, and I ran out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s gooooooooooooo!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [O, oooooooooh, Earth, he’s fired up! He comes running, what a shout and! See here――――]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right now, let’s get this thing starteeeeeeeeeeed!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve finally come this far. I yelled as I ran, not to wait any longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host was confused by my words, but Mr. Machio, who had been waiting for me, changed from a while ago, as if he accepted my words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind at all! Get to it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Eh, hey, Machio!? No, I’ll introduce you both then…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’ve already been introduced enough. From here on out, it’s not words … but power!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was relieved to hear Mr. Machio’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, he flipped a switch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m glad! I wondered what I would do if you were too full of happiness to be up for it. Now then, I’ll just beat you up, Mr. Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, come on! Now let’s fulfill the promise we made three months ago!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The host’s words won’t stop us anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We let ourselves get carried away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that neither the host nor the audience could keep up with the fact that we can start without any preparation, but it didn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll show them. It’s not just Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll show everyone here who have only become interested in Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Super Evolution • Breakthrough】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait and see? Strategy? There’s no need for any of that anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, watch meeeeeeeeeee!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had already warmed up for the final.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything was for this moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Forty chapters to get here from the battle three months ago. Although it was updated every day, it took more than a month in reality, but it is finally here. That was long……
