 “What? A breakthrough, all of a sudden? Although thou has grown in the last three months, thy magical capacity should not have increased so greatly! Does thou intend to have a short-term battle? Thy opponent is the toughest Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A breakthrough from the very beginning would be taken as an unexpected tactic for Jamdi’el, who knows this power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It lasted about 100 seconds as of three months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, she couldn’t help wondering if I was aiming to defeat Mr. Machio in under 100 seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha… how. Suddenly, I was wondering what was going on… you can use the same breakthrough as the master… I never thought you could use such a thing… interesting! Come on, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio is not a guy who uses steps or quick movements to evade the opponent’s attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, he seemed to think that it’s a matter of pride to take all of his opponent’s attacks, and this time he was willing to take all my attacks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it would still be difficult to defeat Mr. Machio in 100 seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if I use the Great Magic Spiral, it would be a different story, but… then it would be boring!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also talked to Tre’ainar many times. Winning the championship is a challenge. That’s why I’m so particular about how I win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would be a waste to finish it with a single big move against such a good opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I’ll release it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, Mr. Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First, lefts from the breakthrough state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it’s not just the left anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh? He… stopped? Why all the way there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After running in, and suddenly using the breakthrough, we would get into a fistfight like this… is what he would have thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I stopped with a certain distance between us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, my punches won’t reach from here… normally, they wouldn’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio. Have you ever been hit with a flying punch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The jab I’ve trained is fast, but… with the breakthrough, it exceeds the speed of sound! This is my… evolved left!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I struck my jab on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My jab, which was further enhanced by the breakthrough, no longer needed to hit with my fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nogu!? Nu… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hey, wh, what was that!? The moment Earth threw a punch from that position, something like a fist clump caught Machio in the face at a distance, making him bounce up!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, no one could tell what had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had never shown my long-distance attack before, and the audience, which had been in a delicate mood, started buzzing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what did he just do!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He made a punching motion, and Machio took damage…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, was it magic!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Must be! His body is cloaked with magic power… he used magic!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I chuckled at the reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I’m using magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it’s not magic that’s attacking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, did thou raise thy fist to that level…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow~, that’s amazing! Jamdi’el, is Earth using magic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, Lady Kron. He wears magic, but Earth Lagann does not attack with magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What do you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, my Heraldic Eyes see through everything… he’s simply… hitting Machio with a shock wave generated by a supersonic punch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Supersonic? Shockwave? Is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. That is… a ‘Sonic Boom’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It appeared only Jamdi’el had seen through my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had a smiling expression and looked to be enjoying herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this was not enough to surprise her yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… right now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a fist shockwave”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shock…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I only hit it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The process is simple. Just thrust out a fist so fast, it hits your opponent with the shockwave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ju, just hit it… s, so simple and you just laid out the whole thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio didn’t take any damage with just one shot, but he seemed a little surprised by my simple explanation of the technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that didn’t matter to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha. That’s right. Easy. In short, it’s just a jab.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I attack with my left jab… so what if you know that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, although my technique has a principle, it doesn’t have a trick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio seemed to have understood this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Continuous hits!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, Gu, th, this!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I hit the jab again and sent shockwaves through the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wh, whooooa, a, amazing! Th, the lefts are too fast already… I can only tell that the air bursts over and over and hits Machio! Machio is on the defensive!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like you can’t easily avoid my left jab even if you know it’s coming, because there’s no specific countermeasure for this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. That’s why the breakthrough. A flesh and blood human being hitting it cannot withstand the punch which creates the shockwave at the sound speed within their body. Back muscles and arm muscles. However, by using the magic of the Breakthrough to strengthen and protect the body at the same time, one can eliminate damage to their body and fire shockwaves repeatedly until the magic power runs out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I see, yes! Anyway, Earth is amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Tre’ainar suggested developing a special technique, I came up with an attack from a distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because although I was able to fight in close quarters with my fists, I couldn’t attack a distant opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could have fought by getting closer with the steps, but I wanted other options.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Most of the guys I’ve fought so far are the ones who accept a fistfight with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only one who used their feet to fight me was Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, I could use magic too, but only to the extent that academy students could.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A long-range attack with the confidence of a fist. When I thought about it, I came to the conclusion that I should just let my fists fly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, thou cannot use this technique without the breakthrough. In other words, while in the breakthrough state, thou can use this technique indefinitely.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, three months ago, even if I had mastered this technique, I would have only been able to use it for 100 seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don’t have that either now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not even Jamdi’el knew about that yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, that’s amazing! Earth… Not only the breakthrough, but such attacks too!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, u, uncle… older brother… who to cheer…… ugh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow…… that’s really cool… big brother, had such a skill…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed I’ve managed to make them forget about the earlier interaction between Mr. Machio, Elder sis Tsukshi and that pervert, at least a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sisters and other guys were amazed with their mouths open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Machio! You’re at a disadvantage from that position!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! Don’t just stand there, get close and catch him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, go! Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But either way, the crowd was impatient and raised their voice to Mr. Machio, who had not moved a single step since the start of the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Machio probably understood that he could not do it as things were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, the audience … I wonder if they’re too unreasonable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, sister. In the first place, even if you can withstand that shockwave and jump at him, how do you catch big brother… the guy uses high-speed steps…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio would not jump in carelessly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, he seemed to realize.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he endured my attacks and jumped in, he couldn’t catch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, hypothetically…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes. The current child is at a level enough to completely defeat the fiercest of martial arts with only his left hand. In addition to jabs, he has not only jabs, but also screws, smashes, counters and other fists with great destructive power. Close combat is not his weakness, but rather his specialty. In other words, the child can handle all short, middle and long range fights when in the breakthrough state. Tis truly a form of …… the generalist that can fight all aspects of battle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s it. If he wants to come, he can come. At that time, I would just hit him directly with my fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is my new power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My original technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the 【Certain Death・Illumination Magic Flash Brilliant Sky Wave Shock Dragon King’s Fist】!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the form of this technique is “more than just a jab”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. There are plenty in the world who shoot flying slashes, make full use of wind magic, and unleash super-powered sonic booms… well… although it is a ‘common’ technique… with just a fist… moreover, not many could release it with just one jab. Oh, my dear, Earth Lagann!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, even though it was the middle of the match, for the first time today, Jamdi’el shouted “my my” in a good mood from the special guest seat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O inheritor of the Great Demon. In the name of the Arcane True Zenith Style Master… I christen this technique the 【Great Demon Sonic Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? …… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? That woman, how would she know to reach that conclusion?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mostly, my skill is the Illumination Magic Flash Brilliant Sky Wave Shock Dragon King’s Fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, why would she…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sonic Jab?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That is called a sonic jab?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good Goddess, Sonic Jab!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a great demon sonic jab!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… hold on!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, eeeeeeeeeeeehh!? Why!? It’s my special move, and you just decided to name it as you please!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no no way, the technique I’ve worked so hard to develop, why are these guys on their own accord…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Since my reunion with Jamdi’el, I once again realize what a real piece of work he is. …… it has nothing to do with dragons, so why did you add “Dragon King” in there…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even Tre’ainar was nodding his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why not? The Dragon King sounds cool!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Every single one of them, why do they have to ruin my extensive vocabulary and naming sense with their …… don’t screw with me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Screw it! In that case, with this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””That stance!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment. I changed my stance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s another stance I’m good at.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Flicker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you think would happen if I released the flicker in this state? It creates a constant barrage of whip-like shockwaves! Yes, this is my 【Super Magic Flash―――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””N, no way… the 【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To the audience, well done!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, they’ve taken the liberty of naming my technique again!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been up all night trying to think of a name for it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That woman… that woman!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? It can’t be… not just jabs… but also shock waves of different shapes and power, depending on the type of …… punch…… hmm? However…… wait a moment…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong? Jamdi’el.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Before that… it’s about time he ran out of magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Jamdi’el was seriously surprised by me after this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is still only the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I decided, I’ll show you everything.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
