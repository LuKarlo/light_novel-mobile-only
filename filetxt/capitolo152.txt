<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el seemed a little bit concerned about what to do from here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With his magic capacity, it should be about time… what will thou do once thy magic power runs out?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how many shock waves were fired, it was still a jab.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio couldn’t dodge them, but he didn’t suffer any serious damage either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed to be holding his ground, waiting for an opportunity to attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Too awesome! That’s the 【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, th, these guys… fine, already! 【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh uh huh, that will do.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My special technique was named without permission, and I felt reluctant about shouting out any other moves from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, this is… quite something. A long distance flicker that is hard to avoid…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I’ll leave the name of the technique aside, but the whip-like shockwave released from flicker carved into Mr. Machio’s steel muscles from the surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This won’t do… although it is a left, this shockwave is not half bad… the impact doesn’t just affect the surface of the body, but also resonates to the inner core…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A normal guy might be finished after one shot, but Mr. Machio is not normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He smiled while enduring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Originally, I was aiming to strike once you’re tired or out of magic, but … let’s jump in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t catch you at my own speed, but… I don’t think there’s any way out of this if I just stay idle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio rushed in regardless of the shockwave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ke, can you bear it~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, uu, Nuuuu!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I’ll raise the gear further. A barrage of left strikes concentrated on Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A twisted corkscrew. Exactly, the sonic boom that is created is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””It’s the 【Great Demon Sonic Screw】!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You bastards! Stop naming someone else’s skill as you like!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Apparently, the people of this country have decent sensibilities.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With just a corkscrew blow, a rotating swirl shockwave was sent flying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, 【Great Demon Sonic Screw】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uo, o! This is?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its power is enough to knock back the stout Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey hey, what would happen if I used the 【Great Magic Spiral】?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wh, Ma, Machio was blown away!? I’ve never seen anything like this before, including spar! What power, the 【Great Demon Sonic Screw】!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the host said, I’m surprised, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more I understood the power of the technique in actual combat, the more the name of the technique faded away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, I’m just excited about the results I could achieve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… I don’t remember ever being blown away this far… it’s impressive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, thanks.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio froze after suddenly crashing into the wall. His face was swollen, but he had a bitter smile while his nose bled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he quickly tightened his expression again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, so I don’t get pushed back this time … I have to endure it properly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time, Mr. Machio, who had been going hand-to-hand and no guard until now, lowered his hips deeply and took a stance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His appearance was like a quadruped beast trying to pounce on its prey, with the intention to jump straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hnnnn!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, every muscle in his body was straining, enlarging, and hardening his body like a large rock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So you’re trying to ram me with that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s nothing ingenious about it. It’s just the 【Arcane True Zenith Tackle】.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… you’re gonna say it before you do it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. I’m clumsy, so I don’t play around. I can only win if I hit you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s simple, and he’s not lying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio really felt like he’s going to lower his hips and push straight ahead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Machio’s declaration, though not a strategy, seemed to be testing me out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I knew you’re going to rush in from the beginning, I can avoid it lightly with my eyes, reaction speed, and steps, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bring it on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dared to stop and hold my body leaning forward, so I could accept it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, this is! Is Earth going to hunker down and take the attack?! Are you going to have a power match against Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s a match. Take it and stand!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And now is the time for this sleeping power to awaken! This right, forbidden and sealed by God—————.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, you cur… do you consider that stylish?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, a… anyway, I’ll lift the ban! On the right!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hah~… such a difficult age…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s the right that I haven’t used today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, I’m flattered. Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio seemed to be a little pleased with my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m facing such Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Su~, fuu~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic that was about to run out was taken in from the air through the magic hole of the entire body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Ah… Are you!? I, it can’t be… surely not!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Jamdi’el’s astonished voice echoed from the guest seat, but before everyone’s attention could be drawn to it, Mr. Machio jumped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here I come! 【Arcane True Zenith Tackle】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the front, it’s like a huge iron ball jumping at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Mr. Machio was heavy, his left and right movements had a weak impression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, since the lower half of the body was trained, the instantaneous forward dash was launched from his strong legs and waist was fast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lifting the ban on the right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put all my strength into my right fist and threw myself out, a full swing with all my power and weight!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like when I fought Toulowe three months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Jolt】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shockwave that seemed to be a counter to the oncoming opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He endured, and as he moved forward no matter what, I met the tackle of Mr. Machio, who was in full momentum, from the front.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, uoh, ooh!? This is!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how big Mr. Machio was, his weight was that of a human after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He got blown away easily, penetrating the wall, and flew to the back room of the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah… overwhelming! Hey, who would have predicted such a development!? Machio, who was said to be the strongest of the Arcane True Zenith, was blown away by the Supernova Earth without even touching him! Everyone has forgotten how to cheer and is just stunned!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, by blowing Mr. Machio away, the whole venue went silent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ma, Machio is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle… went somewhere.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “t, tse~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even those who could speak up seem to be confused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Literally, I silenced all the noisy guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there’s only one person making a lot of noise…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha., Fufufu, hahahahaha! Kukuku, could it be, could it be… surely! Thou has been able to do it! Even I have not mastered the 【Magical Breathing】! Aha, ha, uhi, hiha, hihahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess, who should have both beauty and sanctity, was now screaming like a crazy woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, I’m sorry, I was distraught, Lady Kron. Fufu, however…… this is a bit of a situation… Fufufufu, what can I do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My plan… was to raise the god to be born between Lady Kron and Earth Lagann, and when the time is right, that god and I will mingle to give birth… of god, human, and seraph, all a plan to create the ‘True God’ that combines the blood of all… hahaha! But I want it! I want it now! Absolutely…… Absolutely!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… For now, let’s leave that till later. No but…… is it possible that things are settled with this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, by the way, Jamdi’el. Isn’t this a victory for Earth? May I go and congratulate Earth for winning?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah, about that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, although she made a strange voice and went crazy for a moment, Jamdi’el quickly calmed down in response to Kron’s question…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is a ‘not yet’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara, is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed. Had he used the 【Great Magic Spiral】, you might have been enough to end it, but… he gave Machio a considerably powerful attack halfway through. So, it will take a little longer.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From beyond the penetrated wall, Mr. Machio’s voice praised me in a calm voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My own body is unusually hot and boiling… perhaps after such a long time, I feel like I’m getting stronger, so my body and mind are excited and pleased.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a response. No matter how much Mr. Machio was, he should have taken a lot of damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, he should have been suitably bewildered by my technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In spite of this, I felt somewhat calm or relaxed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, well… Mr. Machio!? tsu…… don’t look Amae!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heugh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, wow… th, that Machio. I’ve never seen Machio so full of injuries before.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From behind the wall with a large hole, Mr. Machio slowly returned to the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, his whole body was swollen all over, his skin shredded as if cut by a sword, and his face cruelly disfigured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lacerations, broken bones, bruises, you don’t need to be a doctor to know that he was badly injured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because it’s Mr. Machio, I attacked with all my might, but…… let’s call it a day.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So no more… ‘unfortunate accidents’ will happen.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu… I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing Mr. Machio, I also relaxed my fighting pose and suggested we end it here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio came back looking unconcerned, but from here onward, it will go beyond the realm of a “match”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, we can’t show any more than this in front of Elder Sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, I gave my suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, if you had attacked with ‘more’ power, I might have lost. But with your attack now, you will have to fight me with ‘more’ attack power from now on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t understand what he was talking about. Is Mr. Machio trying to riddle me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Mr. Machio smiled at me with his battered body…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you, Earth. You were really strong. That’s why I can be even stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh? Wh, what!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio began to scream. Then, there was a change in Mr. Machio’s body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wounds on his torn skin are gradually closed, the swelling is reduced, and even the bones that seem to have been broken were being restored… Healing magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not just healing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah… that!!!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar who was beside me raised an unusually surprised voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, hey hey, what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, that… there is no doubt …recovery far beyond ‘super recovery’…… ‘Super Magic Recovery’!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Super recovery? And it sounds like a more awesome name than that, but what about it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Structure of the human body… applying a load to the body through strength training, and so on, results in a temporary decline due to damage to muscle fiber damage and fatigue accumulation, but by taking appropriate rest, it leads to greater muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy than before due to the recoil of recovery… tis called it Super Recovery.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had heard about that before. However, what was happening to Mr. Machio did not seem to be such a common matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But there are people in the world with a unique constitution… those who intentionally control and activate cells through the body without the need for rest, regenerate and restore the body and bones at super-speed, and gain more power than before.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And tis not just about training. If you fracture, it will regenerate into a stronger and more resilient bone than before, and if you take damage in battle, it will make your body more resilient.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you take damage, it will regenerate and recover at super speed, and even become stronger than before?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s with that ridiculous constitution!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But tis too rare a constitution. In fact, I have not come across many with such a constitution. The last one I know of was ‘Gouda’, one of my Six Supremacy. And…… tis the first time I am seeing it in a human being.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar was astonished by Machio’s constitution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while I was surprised to hear about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, let’s fight more than ever… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was back to… no, he had a stronger body and appeared before me again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Super Magic Recovery… in other words, every time he is attacked and takes damage, he will become stronger and more resilient.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara, Machio’s injuries have healed~!”
