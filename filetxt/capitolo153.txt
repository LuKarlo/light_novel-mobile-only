 Normally, if you want to get stronger, you have to grit your teeth and spend a lot of time doing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can you gain strength in a short time by trading it for severe pain?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t matter which is harder, which is stronger, or which is right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is important is that Mr. Machio has become even stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, you’re currently unafraid, and would first try it out for yourself. As I’d come to expect.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I fire a series of shockwaves from the left jab, focusing on speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although the shockwave that I shot touched Mr. Machio’s body…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good left… but it can’t get through anymore, can it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hard. You can tell the difference without touching it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The response to the shockwave is clearly different from before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It means that the muscles have become harder and denser… but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What about attacks on the skin?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shockwave that hits like a whip and cuts like a blade…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Spear Tackle】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Macho rushed into my barrage of fists regardless, pushed forward despite being hit, and tackled by extending both arms from a low posture to catch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, the dashing power is higher than before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuoo…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I quickly stepped to the right to avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A while ago, I had met him head on, but now I involuntarily avoided the incoming tackle from Mr. Macho.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, he’s quick. He’ll be a pain to catch, but!? Goa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic One Two】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s certainly faster, but still didn’t have the legs to reach me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I turned around and hit the left and right one-two directly on the face of Mr. Machio, who was full of gaps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, even if your recovery is faster, it doesn’t mean that there is no pain, or that the vital points have changed, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, guh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And how long can you stay conscious after continuous hits with punches that exceed the speed of sound?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he got stronger with damage, I can just stun him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio’s legs were slightly swaying when his jaw struck by my one-two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now that he’s completely defenseless, so I’ll knock it in anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Rush】!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, oh, ooooooooh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Consecutive sonic lefts and rights. I kept hitting Machio’s face constantly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Solar Plexus Blow】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Heartbreak Shot】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaeh…… eh!?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After drawing his attention upward with a series of strikes to the face, his body became wide open… I slammed my fist at the speed of sound into his body, then punch out to the heart, completely stopping Mr. Machio’s movement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fly to the end! 【Great Demon Sonic Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeeeehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Any living thing should lose consciousness when struck in the jaw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a perfect smash, the best angle, the best timing, and the best force, I launched Mr. Machio, not only his chin, but also his body, to the heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [So fast! So, strong! that Machio, overwhelmed with random hits! This…… this is the Supernova, Earth! The strength of the rising star who finally got serious is beyond words!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the host said, just looking at the situation, it would seem like Mr. Machio was blown away hands and feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there was a response, it wasn’t what I imagined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was harder than I imagined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… a tremendous rush… at the start of the match, I would have been completely unconscious… but… I endured it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go, 【Arcane True Zenith Flying Body Attack】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was blown into the air, he immediately readied himself, and Mr. Machio attacked while his body was falling upon me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, it’s also a slow attack for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lightly backstep to avoid…… but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Mr. Machio fell to the ground, a huge crack and hole was created in the center of the arena with a powerful ground tremor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was so destructive that a little cold sweat ran down my cheeks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [This is astonishing! Mr. Machio should have suffered a lot of damage, but he recovered so soon and then counterattacked! Good thing Earth dodged. Such ridiculous power! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it would be dangerous if I got hit straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the problem for me was that I could not render Mr. Machio unconscious with the rush just now, rather than the attack power of Mr. Machio’s counterattack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not like he’s tougher or anything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All the same he can take a lot of punishment. It makes me want to doubt that he’s the same person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis certainly an attack with a certain swiftness… after all, I suppose he can endure the attacks he knows are coming.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just then, when Tre’ainar saw Mr. Machio endure my rush, he muttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps, this man has rarely evaded or defended attacks in his life. Tis not so much his resilience… I believe he has mastered the timing of his …… resolve.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Timing of his resolve?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To respond at the instant an attack lands. He fiercely resolves himself to “absolutely stay conscious”, and though he appears to clench his teeth… tis merely a doctrine of willpower, that is to say, mentality… tis certainly that which sustains his body.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Prepare and endure the moment of attack. Such a mentality… while thinking, somehow I was convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Be prepared to endure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the way I’ve trained so far, like in my fistfight with Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not toughness, but determination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, if Mr. Machio had been fighting such battles all his life, it’s probably right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then… how do I knock Mr. Machio unconscious…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First is to kill him. Gouda, the Titan God, was defeated by the hand of ‘your father’ with a single blow so powerful that regeneration and recovery were no match for it, leaving not a speck of dust in its wake. The technique that can be achieved that with your attack is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only technique that has that much destructive power is… the 【Great Demon Spiral】. But…… that would…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Otherwise, tis a matter of shifting the moment when the opponent is prepared… where the opponent’s consciousness is defenseless… an attack when he is neither vigilant nor conscious… an attack that pierces the blind spot of thought.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The blind spot of thought?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes. After all, such resolution is merely a matter of the mind and the brain. Then, the body cannot react to what the brain does not anticipate.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard Tre’ainar’s words, one punch came to my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An attack that pierces the blind spot of thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, an invisible punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The【Great Demon Phantom Punch】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The problem is that Mr. Machio’s attacks are all big and rough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, on the contrary, the timing, angle, and speed of all attacks are different every time, making them difficult to counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I fail, I will suffer great damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But mysteriously, I wasn’t scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I wonder why. I don’t feel like I’m going to fail. I mean… I don’t feel like losing.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Confidence filled me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Probably because I had already succeeded once in an actual battle before this match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The match against Wacha was not in vain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of that, I’m confident enough to take on the challenge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「If my head had been clearer and… if I stay focused… I might have figured out… something.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Super Magic Recovery… surprisingly, also has many disadvantages.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar was astonished by Mr. Machio’s ability. Is that his skill?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even with that skill, I now saw more of a weakness than a threat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Maybe this too… if it weren’t for my days with you, I wouldn’t have thought so…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll show you! Medicine, skills, talent… a simple mediocre ass kicking!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I “entered.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the breakthrough, into the zone state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, let’s cheer you on today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not for me, but for men who live in elliptical spheres, okay?
