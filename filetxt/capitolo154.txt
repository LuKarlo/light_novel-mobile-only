<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What would have happened if I hadn’t met Tre’ainar and fought Mr. Machio?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I probably would have been screaming in front of this ability.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s unfair. Such a cheat skill. Or something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not the case now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All the talents and circumstances we are given are just a means to an end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The same is true for me, who was raised as a Young Lord.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is up to you to decide how to utilize and increase the resources you have at hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So now, instead of envying the opponent’s skill, how do you defeat them? That’s what I naturally began to think about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu… muh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a flicker, but a fine left, true to the basics.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using a combination of shockwaves and direct blows, I thrust at Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Whoa, a sudden change from his heavy barrage, Earth is throwing a fine left. However, a normal man would certainly be blown away by just one of his fists, against Machio…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t intend for that to work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I needed was to read the rhythm, the distance from the opponent, and their breathing and habits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, are you aiming for something?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who knows~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I’m not going to just wait around for it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not working, but constantly being poked by the left doesn’t feel good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While being beaten, Mr. Machio ignored my lefts and ran straight towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Knuckle Arrow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A grandly clenched fist was swung downward. It was too big of a swing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw it and evaded by stepping at the last minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouuoooh, Machio is also fighting back! Th, the punch struck the ground as it is… the ground shattered!? What power!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Avoiding it was a no-brainer, and now the counter could be put in without problems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn’t dare enter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What happened? That should have been a chance, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you talking about? A counter invitation, too obvious.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufun”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was not stupid enough to throw a full swing punch against me who can use counter punches without any thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps he was trying to lure me into a counter attack, daring me to step in and land a punch. He would probably try to endure that punch and catch me right after that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it doesn’t work, he’s confident that he’ll be able to stay aware of my counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The idea was that even if he fails and takes damage, it will make him stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was underestimating me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then what would you do? I can just keep on going! 【Arcane True Zenith Double Lariat】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, both arms were extended and he spun on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio’s powerful arm rotated, and a tornado appeared in the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As always, he’s all about huge techniques…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Chopping Light】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Rush】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A downward right. However, if I, who is shorter than Mr. Machio, strike, the fist will hit the lower body of Mr. Machio. But that was my aim.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I punched out the leg that was the axis of rotation, knocking him off balance and sending him tumbling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, aiming at the collapsed Mr. Machio, I went around to his left side and put a series of hits on Mr. Machio’s “arm”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, uh, arm!? tsu…… still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio, who usually doesn’t defend, has never been hit directly on the arm or elbow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His face contorted slightly as his left arm was hit by my sonic barrage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But then you’d only be strengthening my own arms, not the other way around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how hard I hit Mr. Machio’s arm, it will not make him lose consciousness, but rather the damaged left arm would become thicker and stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, only the arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Screw】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu… again?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hit it. While moving quickly around Mr. Machio, I hit his left arm, moved away, and then hit the left arm again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio gradually began to look sullen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [What does this mean? Earth. Keeps hitting …Machio on the arm. And then, Machio’s arm… only the arm… more and more!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was just as I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio’s skill, Super Magic Recovery. Only the damaged area becomes stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With so much useless muscles, the whole body would lose its balance, Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing that, Mr. Machio also hit me as if crushing a bitter bug.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, although it looked like a strong arm, the power of the fist that was actually swung down was not “sharp”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… You’ve done it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, the muscles are getting too big, and only part of it, not the whole body, is developing too much. Your form is crumbling so much that you can’t properly transmit power.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio has better super muscles than other humans, but the balance with his lower body was lost because I made only his upper body and the arm bigger by this exchange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The base which supported it cannot keep up with the swing of the arm, and after stepping on, the body was open and the axis also shaken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, u… 【Arcane True Zenith Horizontal Chop】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Swinging around with just the muscles of your arm… in other words, you’re hitting with just your hands, Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He couldn’t firmly step onto the ground and hit with his hips.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The blow of Mr. Machio, who originally had a rough form, became even more scattered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve always wondered. You train more than others, run harder than most, and I didn’t get why your blows are so forceful…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio. No matter how much you practice punching and kicking repeatedly, your physique and muscles change every time you fight, so you can’t strike the same blow with the same form every time, can you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All training was done with purpose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To increase power, to develop speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And of course, if the purpose was different, the content of the training will change.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Machio was trained from the damage he suffered, regardless of his intention or purpose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s nothing wrong with strengthening weak points.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, muscles that have overdeveloped and muscles that originally were unnecessary could get in the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Tre’ainar always emphasized “balance” when coaching me in training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You certainly need strength to land a strong punch, but that’s not enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Mr. Machio knew that too. That’s why you usually do so much strength training and roadwork, right? To adjust your balance”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how much Mr. Machio fine-tuned his body balance in his daily training, once the battle began, he was as you can see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you hungry?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……eh … fufu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio chuckled at my question. Apparently, I hit the mark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I reckon you’re talking a lot today, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kuhahaha, cheeky kid, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absolutely!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without answering my question, Mr. Machio moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Knuckle Part! Barrage】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tto…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Front High Kick】! 【Arcane True Zenith Leg Lariat】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Between his fist strikes, he mixed in front kicks and high kicks and threw them at me. However, I could see through them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Water Kick】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yotto!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu, ha… fuh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although there were many counter chances, I didn’t drive in blindly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just wait for the right moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is unusual! It’s a Machio onslaught! He is attacking Earth with a series of intense and powerful punches and kicks!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing! If Machio did that to me, I wouldn’t be able to do anything!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If he lands even one shot, that young man, isn’t it dangerous?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, if he hits even one shot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even one shot…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Due to the large form, each attack felt like a powerful cannon passing in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was still not sharp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Drop Kick】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, if you don’t lose your concentration, you will absolutely not be caught off guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Machio is attacking with great momentum. Even a single hit would be scary. But why doesn’t Earth fight back?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That one shot won’t land, Lady Kron. And Earth Lagann sees through it all. Machio may recover by Super Magic, but his stamina will be greatly reduced.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why he dares to take all the effort and even invite numerous near misses. And he aims… to land one blow.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The people around me cheered on Mr. Machio, who was aggressively attacking, and screamed at the attacks that passed my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I saw through it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el at the special seat…… and Tre’ainar beside me…… were watching it all…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio… if thou care to win… thou will have to use ‘that’, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… well…… this fellow… is he able use ‘that’ as well as Gouda? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like I heard an ominous muttering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was actually going to post this after the match was over, but before the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, it seems that the impression section is heating up. However, as I have said before, I would be happy if my readers didn’t get too upset with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, some people commented that the impression section should be login-only, but I would like to wait and see how it goes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So far, I don’t think anyone has commented on “things that have nothing to do with the work”, but rather the opinion of “what I think “.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, this work is read by many people now, so bookmarks, and drills… I have received “evaluations” from the form below, which is reflected in the ranking and leads to more people reading it. However, I don’t think it makes sense to say, “I’ll take your evaluation, but I don’t want your harsh comments”, so I’ll take what I can get. * Well, if it really makes sense, I’d like to reply with your impressions, but I’m sorry about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, I would be happy if you could put the conflict between readers to rest after this story.
</div>
