<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, Mr. Machio’s breath was rising.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was constantly moving his heavy, unbalanced body with all his might, without pacing himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Elbow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio may also be gradually losing his composure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The assembly of the attack was falling apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s reckless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why he could swing it around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Medulla Oblongata Kick】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than using my feet to stay out of Mr. Machio’s reach, I dare to wander at a distance that Mr. Machio could reach me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That way, Mr. Machio will inevitably move his body in an attempt to catch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio, go! Not again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, a little more… wow, that was paper-thin! Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s so close that I’m scared just looking at it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The audience cheered as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s only so many people in this situation that I knew what I was aiming for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, amazing… it’s my first time… seeing Machio like that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s completely swallowed up by big brother’s pace…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder sis Tsukshi and Karui… and……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio’s fighting style is basically passive. A waiting style. After letting the opponent hit you, you then reciprocate with a single counterattack to finish him off. However…… now he himself is attacking like that, swinging my limbs around… he seems to have completely lost himself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She… Sadiz… even if she doesn’t remember, she understood the battle situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that fellow in the guest seat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Impossible… more maneuvers and techniques that surpasses even Wacha… and with that dynamic vision and footwork, even the Breakthrough… thy concentration is also increasing. Furthermore, the breakthrough remains uninterrupted by Magical Breathing. With Machio as he is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, is that so? Then, will it be Earth’s victory?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… what will happen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Jamdi’el’s appearance from here seemed calm as she watched the fight, unlike the excited and frenzied appearance from a little while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the looks of it, I can’t help but think that “there is still something”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I don’t think that everything would go my way, but I was confident that I could do what I needed to do …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Double Lariat】! …… kara!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I could instantly understand what Mr. Machio was trying to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A punch that spins around on the spot called a Lariat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, it would be a technique to blow away surrounding opponents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Machio had another goal in mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Spin around and accelerate, and using that centrifugal force…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Straight】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A straight right punch that threw the whole body forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A punch with the power of the entire body behind it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it hits, there wouldn’t be a single lump.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could see that he was “inviting the counter” to this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Cross Counter】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here it is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stabbing each other with a left cross counter at the speed of sound. I should be faster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, because Mr. Machio also read this, so here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unuuooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio changed the trajectory of the straight punch which recoiled with so much centrifugal force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He stopped his fist and jumped up my crossed arms, making the muscles in his arms bulge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, if such a sudden stop is made, the muscles and nerves of Mr. Machio’s arm would have been torn to shreds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, Mr. Machio stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was the first defense that Mr. Machio, who had been on the receiving end of all of his opponent’s attacks, had shown. His first technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it was the same counter break as Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Cross Counter Return】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””” Machio… does such a technique!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, for those who knew him, it’s probably the first time they’re seeing that Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A style different from the Mr. Machio they’ve seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in exchange for that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My face was defenseless, and a reversal of the left… my left arm was thoroughly hit by a gargantuan strike.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Double Cross-Coun-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cross-counter return counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was trying to hit me with a double cross counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thanks to my predictable move, I was preparing on the right…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Got him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cut him down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, there was a flash of light and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ma… Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? No…… eh? What…… Ms. Sadiz, did you get it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… If…… if all of this wasn’t a coincidence, but something he aimed for… it’s horrifying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A venue had quieted down in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was Mr. Machio, crawling in the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Wh… eh? W… wh… what happened!? M, Machio just broke Earth’s counter and on his counter, why did Machio fall down there… did he fail!? No, I’m sorry! M, my eyes were open, but I couldn’t see it!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. How many people could understand this situation?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fool… there is no way you can win by having counter match against a counter-user. Had thou lose composure such extent? Machio? But Earth Lagann is here as well… kuku… I, truly am shocked at the moment…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um~…… Jamdi’el… w, what just happened?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Err… it is art.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe over there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『N, nicely… ha!? E, erm, t, tis pasable, uh huh, as one would expect of my disciple. I shall praise you now, hmm. Although tis against a sluggish opponent, I never … not a phantom punch… but a successful 【Great Demon Triple Cross Counter】!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To that extent? Hmm? I mean, what’s with this guy doing a guts pose for a moment?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, yes. Triple cross.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio invited my counter, broke the cross counter, and then he countered me with a double cross, and I counter his double cross.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, you can’t do it without extreme concentration, and it’s impossible to be told to do it again under normal conditions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the level of response I had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How’s it going? Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it was just a counter that uses the opponent’s attack, I did it against Mr. Machio’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sharpness was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… ka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was so powerful that it was like waking up from a reverse shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think he was definitely unconscious for a moment, but Mr. Machio woke up, crawling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uo… ka… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was more of a shock than damage or destructive force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Punching out the jaw and shaking the brain…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh… no…… no more…… ka, tricks…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Hey, wait a minute. oh…… are you gonna get up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… my jaw… fuh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only did you not lose consciousness, but will this still happen?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can’t be… he should have been struck out… it’s not at that level of him being used to pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure I hit my best shot with the greatest strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, geh… be… ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio, who tried to stand up, spit out a large amount of blood from the mouth, which was not able to speak well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi?! Mr. Machio!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ie… Amae… wooaah, he’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “!? I can’t see! Hey, what’s wrong, uncle? Older brother!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That amount… surely… the tongue?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The jaw was certainly shattered. It’s not strange to spit blood out, but I felt like it was a little bit much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I knew immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This guy… you had your tongue in your teeth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio tried to release the counter against the counter breaking, so he stuck his tongue between his teeth in case something should happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio’s tongue now is… I don’t even want to imagine… I’ve never done that before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He didn’t clench his teeth, but his tongue…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Was… … different…… than expected. I…… took… a bit…… more of…… a risk…… ka. didn’t I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Mr. Machio, who stood up, was quietly hanging down, but slowly raised his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Fuh~…… I won’t let you down… to be able to compete with your Breakthrough… I also…… I wanted to respond, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The broken jaw and the wound on the tongue, which was almost bitten off, were gradually closing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let me show you… the speed and power pushed beyond my limits… ‘Super Pump Up’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment Mr. Machio said that, I heard Tre’ainar murmur, “just as I thought…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, the Japanese national team did it again! The battle of the elliptical ball was fired up after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rugby passes are also screw passes. Screw…… drill…… no, that’s hot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, thank you for the many drill evaluations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it was really encouraging.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, I was injected with two wonderful spirits called reviews.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Please continue to mercilessly screw it in and pierce it!
</div>
