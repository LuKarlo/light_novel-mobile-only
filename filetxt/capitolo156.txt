 “Pump up? What is that? Do you still have another hand, Mr. Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not really another hand, but a technique I didn’t want to use if possible. It would put me in danger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, I knew that if I didn’t, you’d be out of my reach and I’d end up a disappointment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… I think you’re splendid enough…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although I pointed out his weaknesses, Mr. Machio was still strong enough to boast that much skill and that much power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s risky and… I can’t help but be reminded of the past… so…… I didn’t want to show it to Tsukshi… but right now, it’s more important to respond to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not the end of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not yet, Mr. Machio still had more to give, and I understood that he wasn’t bluffing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Super Magic Recovery… if applied, could enable muscle control… and eventually allow increased blood production and blood flow control.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. If you are the one who reached the Breakthrough by the depths of the magic path… then me… I’ll show you the potential of the human body.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Mr. Machio held his breath and strained his whole body so that every blood vessel in his entire body was visible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. Human beings usually use only 20 to 30 percent of their power. There is a limiter on it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His teeth were clenched incomparably to the men who boasted of their muscles in the dojo, and his face was so red that it seemed that the blood vessels in his head would burst.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understood when I saw it… very likely…… that lad, José, forced it with medicine… however…… I…by my own power- - “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t… oh…… ooh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Physical strength… power…… speed…… this is my all right now! Earth!!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Machio barked, the air trembled, and at the same time, a fierce dash… so fast!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoooooh, oooooooh! Ouooooooooooh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, guh, wh, hold on!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio, who always wore a calm and mature atmosphere, raged violently like a fierce beast that couldn’t contain its excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He brandished his arms, brandished his legs, and sometimes tried to tear me with his hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The attack was a big swing, so if you could anticipate it, you could avoid it… but…… it’s much faster compared to before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t expect Mr. Machio to be able to achieve such speed while his body was out of balance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s ruuuuuuuuuun!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… tch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was bigger than me and had a longer stride. That’s why my step was different from Mr. Machio’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio was speeding up, so I had to go around him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, calm down a little!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it doesn’t seem to be subsiding at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your eyes are no longer sane, are they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sister… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. That figure… I’m sure. During the civil war… when surrounded by the Old Kingdom forces… Mr. Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m sure that power came from… his heart…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… please stop! Mr. Machio! Hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Elder Sis Tsukshi was screaming, but is she stopping Mr. Machio?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Worried about me? No. That expression, rather it’s about Mr. Machio himself… what? From the movement of the mouth, it looked like she’s… H・AR・T
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no, in my current state of extreme concentration, I could tell from the movement of the mouth of a person in a place so far away…hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If he uses that technique for too long… Machio will die!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh……? Now…… Elder Sis Tsukshi… die? He’s gonna die…? Will Mr. Machio die if this continues?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Careless! Idiot, what am I doing… I shouldn’t be so careless against Mr. Machio…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Body Upper】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uboh!? Gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That went through my torso … what… with only the arm strength of the hand-strike, my body was completely bent at the spine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [He caught hiiiiiiim! At last, the serious Machio is finally unleashed, and Machio’s strong arm strikes out at Earth’s body! This is intense!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good, numb… feet…… move…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uohoooooh 【Arcane True Zenith Knuckle Arrow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…tch! Damn!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good, punch to the face… unavoidable…… in that case!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah, Machio’s face punch hit Earth! Earth’s neck is fully… hmm? Huh? No…… this is!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the feet can’t move, parry with a neck twist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!? …… Oh, that’s Wacha’s neck twist!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surely, the 【Arcane True Zenith Slipping Away】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wrong, 【Great Demon Slipping Away】 … is it the same…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuooooh, 【Arcane True Zenith Shin Lariat】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah, Machio is going on and on with quick successive blows! However, Earth, sways and upper body deflections… the hits can’t land! Ma goddess, he’s seen through them all!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, no, my legs are still… sh*t…… I’ve hit him so hard so many times, but he’s fine now, and I’m done in with one shot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So you could do this much damage in my breakthrough?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just… so unfair… I shouldn’t think about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wowoooooooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Parrying】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can’t help having different pools of experience than others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Now, Machio’s stopping arm… he knocked it down with his fist at an angle!? What eyes!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to draw from my experiences.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if my feet don’t move, with this dynamic vision…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Water Surface Kick】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is bad, my legs can’t move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My legs were completely cleared by Mr. Machio’s water surface kick… I fell on my butt and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sh*t!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s oveeeer, Earth! With this blow!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no! Mr. Machio lifted me up to his head with both hands as I fell… this is?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no, Earth is in a pinch! And take a look! Machio lifted Earth overhead, and… this is a great move that is synonymous with Machio!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh, OOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Mr. Machio, that’s not a good idea!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother! At this rate…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, this is it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The audience was going wild.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s it. This was that technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A technique that was used the first time I sparred with Mr. Machio at the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time it’s different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Mr. Machio was still holding back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s too excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Super power. And if you hit the ground with this momentum…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, my master’s eyes were shining again as they did then!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, so it’s… so … huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s face… like he’s looking at me with anticipation, saying “It’s here!”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Remember. What I was doing during my training…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Apart from the special technique… I have something I want you to teach me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I learned Magical Breathing, and during the special training period, I asked Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― So, what would you have me teach you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― That…… yo…… when I sparred with Mr. Machio, you got mad at me for avoiding his attack, for being unable to read the mood, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Nu… the Power Bomb, to the Moonsault flow, is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――…… that…… thing…… what should I do…… what is the right answer?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, when I avoided the technique that Mr. Machio had performed in our spar, both Tre’ainar and the people in the dojo looked at me with condemnation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s ridiculous. I thought, but then I was wondering how I could have done it right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, Tre’ainar had such eyes shining with excitement… then he was so angry… and frustrated…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Fu~…… My Goodness, this cur, so adorable…… ahem! Um, adequately prudent! Let me guide you! In the first place, as a reversal technique for the power bomb…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my request, Trainer was happy and somewhat enthusiastic as he taught me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Power Bomb】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you can’t use footwork, you can do this much!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Wh, this is!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaaaaaahhh E, Earth, I, I say?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Wow, Ouooooooooooh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuo! Gooooooooo, chiiiiiiiiiiiild! That is the waaaaaaaaaayyy!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With both feet, I held Mr. Machio’s head firmly and spun around so that he flew diagonally backwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Corkscrew Head Scissors】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using the recoil, plant Mr. Machio’s brain into the ground!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the momentum of the breakthrough, Mr. Machio’s current body, which was further unbalanced, was easily turned inside out by me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How’s Thaaaaaaaaat!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Sshi!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How was it? This was all right, wasn’t it? That’s the right answer, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll probably never use this technique again except in a fight against Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I learned it. And made it work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you have any complaints?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tte… other than sparring or a show… it’s not even acting, it’s the first time I’ve been hit with this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he had fallen on top of his head, Mr. Machio still did not lose consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jeez, he’s a really tough guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, ha~… ei… ha~, ha~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio’s breath was rising. It looked pretty painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, there was a considerable amount of wear and risk associated with this pump-up thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ke, I’m not using that again. And next time, I’ll settle it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Mr. Machio continued to use this technique, it would be dangerous. But so what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Machio, I don’t think you can take anymore! More than that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Machio! That technique is -“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder sis Tsukshi, who would know the risks to Mr. Machio, tried to shout, but I raised my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Noisy! Come on! Let’s decide, Mr. Machio! Let’s see who wins this fight!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me, Mr. Machio. I’m just a 15-year-old kid who hasn’t had to deal with civil war, poverty, or anything as harsh as you have. You, an adult, are not moved by the tears and screams of women. You know the risks and you’re choosing to take them, I can’t lecture you, or tell you to cherish your life, or talk like I’m conceited enough to know what you’re all about, I have no remarks to cool you off with and I’m not qualified to do that. I’m just going to do my best to surpass you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Mr. Machio doesn’t feel like backing out, it’s not my place to interfere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m just going to hit him as hard as I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu… it’s settled… ah, I have no objection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll finish it! With this blow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My feet… are still a little heavy to use footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, in this state, I have no choice but to hit the strongest technique I can muster in this state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was going to use Frankensteiner, but that’s a bad idea because it comes from a person’s name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that sense, so does the Dempsey Roll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, thank you for the drills and evaluations as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, I was surprised to climb to 9th place overall for a day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I look forward to working with you!
