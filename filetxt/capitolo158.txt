 “Let’s all go too, not just Ms. Sadiz!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth! You did it! Oh, man, are you crying?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized, following Sadiz, Mortriage and the others also rushed into the arena and piled up on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no, tears…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… is crying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is so happy that he cried, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone ran up to me and I quickly wiped away my tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m not crying! I had a little bit of dust in my eyes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””No, no, no, you’re bawling.””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up, tch, don’t look at me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My eyes were red, so I couldn’t fool anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whaoo! Big brother, this is bad! Bad, seriously bad! Big brother got my crying manly tears too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I said I’m not crying, damn it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, although they had seen me crying, I didn’t feel that embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if I can call it the best day of my life, but I was honestly happy right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio, are you okay~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I’m feeling rather refreshed now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seems so, but I don’t want you to push yourself anymore~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… made you…… worry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio, who wielded power at the risk of his life, also needed medical attention, but he doesn’t seem that bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s resting now, being cared for by Elder sis Tsukshi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uncle…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Gugh “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa… what is it? Are you trying to comfort me? Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Older brother… uncle… were both cool.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, then make sure you tell Earth that, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The battle was over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only my acquaintances, but I also heard voices praising both me and Mr. Machio. I was a little embarrassed, but I waved and responded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, we haven’t finished the sacred tournament commendation yet, now have we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! How sly! I also want to praise Earth and Machio, but everyone got ahead of me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahem. Lady Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the arena, with me and Mr. Machio surrounded by many people, Jamdi’el and Kron came down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el had a bitter smile, and Kron was a bit sulky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Sadiz… For now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who regained her memory, naturally remembered Jamdi’el as a former Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now she made eye contact with me and nodded that she wouldn’t do anything here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, calm down! From this, to the winner of the Arcane True Zenith Style Fighting Tournament, words of blessing and an award from the Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el’s words calmed the festive buzz in the arena, and Kron stood in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you all. Everyone at this tournament, you all~~ did your best! The people who didn’t win and those who won were all amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I smiled and chuckled at Kron, who spoke excitedly like a child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Earth was the best among all those who worked so hard. It was really cool.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. …… thank you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’d like to present Earth with the championship trophy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trophy? Come to think of it, I’ve received “silver medals,” “bronze medals,” “participation awards” and so on, but I’ve never received a winning trophy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder how big it is. Ah, but if you’re going on a trip, it’s going to be luggage…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Earth! Congratulations!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buho!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuo!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron held out a large trophy to me, with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we saw it, I, Tre’ainar, and Sadiz burst out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because for that trophy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha … hahaha…”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ku, gu … Jamdi’el… Nuuoo… what is this insult!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The golden trophy was in the shape of a person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The master next to me… it was a statue of Tre’ainar with wings growing out of his back, his left hand on his hips, his right foot on a square pedestal, his right index finger protruding toward the heavens, and a crown on his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This, it was definitely designed by Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, from Sadiz’s point of view, of course it’s not a funny scene, but I’m sorry. I laughed as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I can’t take this on my journey… it’s dangerous in many ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I don’t want to give it up because it’s the first trophy I’ve won in my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it is… the first winning trophy of my life… the statue of Tre’ainar… has a strange connection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keep it up… did you get what you wanted?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I remembered Kron’s words, which she asked with a smile, that I previously heard on the beach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Why is Earth working so hard?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― To get stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I said so without hesitation. But Kron knew what I really meant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Earth is… a liar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Because that’s not all, is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I think what Earth really wants is not just strength, but something more. It must have something to do with Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had understood me since then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Now……definitely.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It looks like it! I’m glad!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded my head, feeling deeply moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here you go, Earth! Really~, thank you for your hard work.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth was cool… so amazing… I was very excited!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, oh, ooooh… Thanks.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The trophy was handed to me by Kron with a gloomy look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, it was fairly heavy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s usually made of pure gold. I think it’s quite expensive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt much heavier than it actually is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hehe…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is what I gained from my achievement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It proved as an undeniable fact that I won today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U… o Uuooooooooooooooohh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I noticed, I was holding up the trophy and shouting at the top of my lungs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, in response, everyone cheered and gave me a big applause again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Among them were Mr. Machio and the other guys who participated in the tournament. …… no José though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz may have complicated thoughts about the trophy form being Tre’ainar, but she still gave me a round of applause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The prize money will be arranged at a later date. In addition, the supplementary prize will be presented to the winner, Earth Lagann, tonight, so clean thyself properly… anyway, look forward to it. And it will be announced to the public soon.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””????”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In any case, this concludes the Arcane True Zenith Style Fighting Tournament! Dismissed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””O… OOUUUUUUUUUUHHHHH!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The matter of Jamdi’el’s supplementary prize. Most people tilted their necks because they couldn’t understand “that”, but some of the sisters who were aware of the situation were smiling or blushing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, unaware of the circumstances, was “?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron had her usual grin with no particular change, but honestly, I can’t read her inner thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But… this… is it that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said… Jamdi’el’s aim is… but Kron seemed to be too normal for that… no, maybe she’s that kind of person…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, we’re celebrating today, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! Let’s get noisy today!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! Yeah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as the group broke up, Mortriage’s crew held my shoulders and laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, if only for today…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahaha, ou. Let’s celebrate!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was the least I could do… I thought, and laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Alright, today your Big Sis will make a lot of treats! You should come too, Machio~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure. I was invited.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! Besides…… I’m really glad that Machio wasn’t the winner… I’m really grateful to Earth~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, because she knew about the supplementary prize for winning, Elder sis Tsukshi was really relieved … or rather, I’m wondering if it was okay to meddle…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big sister! Amae too! Amae will help you today! Me too! I’m cooking!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, of course!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was very excited for me and Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Amae ran up to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cool… you were good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Thank you for your support.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Un! Un! Kyahooi!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I patted her head and thanked her, Amae happily smiled and ran around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, you’re so cute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Onya~, Amae~ you’re so excited. I mean, Big brother! By the way, what about that “technique” you worked on in our special training!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, oh … that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah! I forgot about it, but what was the point of going through all that hassle in your special training with me!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no, Mr. Machio cornered me, so I couldn’t afford to use it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’m sorry, Karui. I wasn’t in a situation to use “that technique”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Lady Kron. Let us return.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh~, I want to talk with everyone too~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you have much preparations to do for today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Muu~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After their business was over, Jamdi’el took Kron’s hand and quickly left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, she left without knowing the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s something we’ll find out tonight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was one thing I absolutely had to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finished…… Regardless of the pros and cons, it’s the first time I’ve written a tournament like this from start to finish, and now I’m lingering in the afterglow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is also because everyone injected drills, impact and spirit at the right time every time. Thank you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… is this a go? The comprehensive evaluation drill…… a major mark!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think about it, I think it was the first time since the battle with Shinobu that the Great Demon Spiral was released, so it’s been about 100 chapters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s strange that this technique makes me want to be synonymous with it, even though there are a lot of flickers etc. put out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in this story, the period of training is 2 months in the Empire, and 3 months in Cacretale. In other words, it’s been about 5 months since Tre’ainar and Earth met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And since this novel started in May of this year, I happened to notice that the same period has passed in reality.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
