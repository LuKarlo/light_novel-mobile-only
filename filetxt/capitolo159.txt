<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, there was something I had to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mortriage… Elder sis Tsukshi… everyone. Would you mind going back to church first?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I just…I’ll talk to Sadiz for a bit.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Erm…… well…… sure, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, we have to talk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really… I’d like to have a party, but… let’s talk first.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to just let the timing get away from me and leave things to fizzle out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine, right Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, come along… just for a bit.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz nodded to my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I avoided even talking to Sadiz and ran away from the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Sadiz chased after me with my mother and the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And today, Sadiz caught up with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I won’t run away anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to make up my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― When your memory returns, say it again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Eh? That’s…… of course, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― At that time, I won’t run away either. To you… now that you’re here, there’s something I want to tell you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was also a promise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day I learned Magical Breathing, I made a promise to Sadiz at the beach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Did you get all your memories back?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How are you feeling?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m fine, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, that day… in my match, when I used the Great Magic Spiral…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… yes…… vividly… and…… what I might have said…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadly, Sadiz’s tone was heavy, but she was speaking clearly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because that moment was the trigger that sparked Sadiz’s abominable past, and at the same time, it shaped us into what we are today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s strange, isn’t it? We used to be together every day as a matter of course, but now …… I’m so defensive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… yes…… everything is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t do that. I mean, I’m the one who should be talking to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Walking away from everyone with Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I walked a little ahead of her, and she followed a little behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way… is my reputation in the Imperial City still the same? The lowest bastard, involved with the Demon King’s Army, or something like that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s… hard to tell right now. When Little man left the Imperial City, I immediately followed after him along with madam and the princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… why did the princess also… that doesn’t matter now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was still laughing and making noise in the arena, but for us, the mood was getting heavier and heavier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can’t be helped, though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just so you know, I have nothing to do with the Demon King’s army. I was just kidnapped by Jamdi’el. That’s why I didn’t even know that Cacretale was like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I remember what happened three months ago. Suddenly, Jamdi’el’s magic took us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A relationship with the Demon King’s Army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used Tre’ainar’s technique in the graduation match in front of the Emperor, so the entire Imperial City was suspicious of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the abuse that was hurled at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… it’s all because I … got deranged… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, that’s okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was unavoidable… I already knew… in a way, it’s not wrong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it all started with the words Sadiz screamed in confusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, when Sadiz saw my 【Great Magic Spiral】, she remembered that it was a technique that once destroyed her hometown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now that I think about it, it was already unavoidable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because I… I don’t have anything to do with the ‘Demon King’s Army’… but I’m involved with ‘The Great Demon King Tre’ainar’. No, that’s not even the same level of involvement.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz paused for a moment at my words. When I looked back, her eyes opened wide and she was frozen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King is the enemy of Sadiz’s hometown and family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a being that died before I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why and how did I get involved with the Great Demon King?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el… is she gone yet?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t let…… Jamdi’el hear what I’m about to tell you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked around once, made sure there’s no one else nearby, and then I talked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… right now…… next to me… do you see anyone there?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Little man? What…… even if you ask… nobody…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pointed next to myself as I walked. Sadiz looked flustered, as if she didn’t know what I was talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I know she couldn’t see it, and Sadiz naturally thinks no one was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m very serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when he realized what I was about to do, Tre’ainar spoke up in a panic, but I couldn’t stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, father, mother, and even Jamdi’el couldn’t see ‘this guy’; you can’t even hear his voice. But ‘he’ is definitely here. “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? He is? What? No one’s here, right? What in the world, Little man… what do you think you are seeing, Little man!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll tell you everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t told anyone about it for the last five months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t even try to tell anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because no one would believe it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, honestly, even if I tell Sadiz this story, she might be wondering, “Are you okay?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was my way of settling things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you remember, Sadiz? Five months ago… the Mansion Armory… behind the seal where the sword of the hero is… when I collapsed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…… yes, of course I remember.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ever since that day… I’ve been with this guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did this happen in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It all started that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That day, I… I met the ghost of Tre’ainar…… the Great Demon King, who had remained in this world after failing to …… pass on at the end of previous war.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Tre’ainar has been by my side ever since that day… will continue to be.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I talked to Sadiz, who has been the closest to me in my life, more than my father and mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you think I’ve lost my mind, so be it. If you think I’m stupid, go ahaed. But I’ll only tell you the truth from now on. Even if you don’t see him, can’t hear anything, and can’t believe it, Tre’ainar is definitely here, right now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if what I’m going to say was unacceptable to Sadiz, the only way to tell the truth about how I could have used the Great Magic Spiral was to tell it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To settle with Sadiz, and for me to truly graduate and leave the nest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So today, for the first time, I’m going to tell someone about Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your continued support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This novel has finally exceeded the overall rating of 100,000 drills!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is also thanks to everyone who has been so excited together to this day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The overall evaluation exceeds 100,000 drills, which puts it at about 250 out of 680,000 works as of the 15th anniversary of syosetu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am honestly happy that I was able to incorporate this novel into it, and at the same time, as a novelist and a contributor, I think I was able to achieve one result.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, this novel is still ongoing, and the goal of 1,000,000 drills is still far away, so I hope you will continue to work with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How far? Wherever!
