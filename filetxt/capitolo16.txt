 The warm-up took my breath and my mind was spent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the steps can be fast and rhythmical, the magic doesn’t work well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once you’re focused on magic, the steps are disrupted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never imagined it would be so difficult to do two things at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What happened? Seems you are out of breath with only this level. You have been raised pampered after all.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugu! Gu… One more time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fu, Wind Crossover Step!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuoh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You put too much strength in the shoulders.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I have to get used to this. To find a style that will make me stronger and is unrelated with my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, the bosoms will be out of reach.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Oooh, not done yeeeettt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s best to use motivation when you are tired! Yes, it’s an oppai-ration! [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never knew. That’s enough to make me feel like I can still do it, and my heart won’t break!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes. Tis good to be motivated, but you are getting messy. Even tired, make sure to do the right steps and cast the right magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can do it! No, I will do it! I’ll get to feel Sadiz’s boobs! Pinch! Su, sucking…… Guhehehehe…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going all the way… No, I’ll be a good child who is ready to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… You’re playing a strange game with a lot of spirit. Little man”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was too focused and didn’t notice any sign Sadiz was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz looked at my ladder training and seemed a little amazed… No……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… But…… Hm…… This is…… Unexpectedly…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first she was amazed, but she immediately seemed to be impressed then she had an expression of interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth. This game…… No, did Little man think up the training method?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… No…… This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected of Sadiz. At first glance, it seems she understood that this training which looks silly is effective in various ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I didn’t come up with it, but… I can’t tell you the truth. Here……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. An omnipotent ally granted me this revelation… I wonder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m not lying. Sadiz doesn’t seem to understand my words, and she’s tilting her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar was by my side looking rather smug.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it’s good. Anyway…… I have the menu schedule you had requested. For now, it’s for this month.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz gave me a piece of paper. It’s a menu schedule for my meals that I asked for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From today, Tre’ainar said he was going to look over it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, if you have any requests, please let me know. I’ll ignore likes and dislikes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Please keep doing your best.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Sadiz returns to the mansion without asking too much about the ladder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I opened the menu schedule for my meals from today that was handed to me by Sadiz, Tre’ainar looked at it as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho-u… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, he was impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis excellent. A rich menu.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, he praised Sadiz’s menu. I was a little proud of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Sadiz’s cooking has a lot of variety, and is all delicious. Her housework is perfect, and she is beautiful… Hey, I really have to get married.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, not that.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I assumed you were eating only luxurious high-quality ingredients every day because you are a rich son who grew up spoiled, but it seems not.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar says what he means while looking at the menu schedule.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a well-thought-out balanced menu with proteins, vitamins and minerals, carbohydrates and lipids. What’s more, the variety of menu ensures that you do not get bored or the same item is not repeated.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes… Is that it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh. Tis especially suited to a body in development like yours. You are currently in a critical stage during your growth period. Very well, consideration for your body and your health has been put first.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never really cared about any of that, I just ate my meal as usual while saying “S-soo gooood”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now that Tre’ainar told me so, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Just looking at the menu schedule… The person who thought up and made this…… you can tell that they care deeply about you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got a warm feeling in my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why all the years. Sadiz……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz is… Before I was born… When she was about three years old, … In the war with the Demon King’s army, her parents died. My mother, who was at the scene, saved her when she was about to be killed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Seven Heroes… Mamu?』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. So, my mother had intended to leave Sadiz in an orphanage, too.… somehow she got adopted, my sister… She was like a daughter and we were raised together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And after the war, Sadiz graduated from the Academy with excellent grades and earned the qualification of a warrior. She felt indebted to my mother, so she stayed in this mansion and became my exclusive maid. So Sadiz is to me… like a real sibling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have any brothers, but… my sister is… Maybe that’s what it’s like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My father was so busy as the [Warrior Prime]. My mother often travels around many countries. Neither of them is at home often. So…… maybe it’s just Sadiz. She and I… She’s been with me since I was little.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surrogate mother, fill-in sister. There’s no blood connection, but I really felt that way, and now more… I want… more……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. I do not understand human romance and love, but… tis quite innocent. She is not merely an object of sexual desire, you have pure affections as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s jeers as he said that felt so embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, not only the bosoms as a reward… In the game before you…… demonstrate how cool you are. Tis about handling yourself and fighting with a feeling of gratitude for the woman that nurtured you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, and he gave me even more motivation and I got excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While hearing that had more motivated, it also…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『 What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you really the dreadful Great Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wretch, do you truly intend to mock me?!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I was starting to get a strange feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] “(]ლ)” This is a terrible pun and I’m ashamed I didn’t know what else to do with it! Any other terrible boob pun that could have gone here? Throw em in the comments. Let’s see whose is the cringiest!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Honestly, with the author’s naming pattern so far, I wouldn’t be surprised if Mamu is the actual name of Earth’s mother. The MTL released it as Ma’am but I doubt Tre’ainar would show that respect to an adversary.
