 There weren’t many people on the beach, probably because it was evening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz and I sat down on the beach and talked about what happened to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That day, I met Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By possessing me, Tre’ainar was able to go out into the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, he started to train me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unusual training that I have never done before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That we read books together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That he was strict.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were teasing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We had an argument.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had my back pushed out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Our talk couldn’t be brief. To think my daily life became so intense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz listened to me in silence the entire time without interruption.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… I was taught… a technique called the Great Demon Spiral. Well in fact…… I didn’t know what it meant for Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A technique that took everything away from Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked for lessons from the one who took everything from Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, it was inevitable that Sadiz would be distraught at the graduation match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t resent Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then the question is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… I found out what this technique meant… but I still used it earlier. I will continue…… to use it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… I’m… sorry… Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never known a time of war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I know what Tre’ainar did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also know what Tre’ainar has taken from Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also know that Sadiz will never forgive Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine if you …… despise me, and you can …… choose not to forgive me, but still I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, if you were to tell me this out of the blue, I wouldn’t believe it or be able to wrap my head around it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can see a ghost, and that ghost is The Great Demon King Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, Sadiz and I were talking without being in this situation, she would have dismissed it with “Is your head all right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I used Tre’ainar’s technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do you explain that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no choice but to reveal everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pl, please wait… Little man… that, a little longer…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although she didn’t outright deny me, Sadiz was confused and holding her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honesty… even if I was suddenly told about something I cannot see… but, if you’re convinced that you can ‘see the ghost of the Great Demon King’…… then everything up to this point would actually make sense…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This reaction was natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Sadiz, who is smart, would not immediately believe in the existence of ghosts if she was suddenly told of their existence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Sadiz also knew that I wasn’t lying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Assuming that …… all of that is true… the ghost of the Great Demon King… would not do something to harm Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not like that. I can see him, we can have conversations, but he can’t touch me, and in this state Tre’ainar can’t use magic on me either.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is … that so? B, but… conversations, then can he… um…… what does he say… erm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing Sadiz’s reluctance, I knew what I wanted to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was what I expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not being threatened… I don’t think I’ve been …… verbally manipulated or …… brainwashed. I’ve been …… influenced, though.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Little man… ah… tsu…… sorry…… I didn’t mean to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She thinks I’m being brainwashed, doesn’t she?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t blame her for thinking that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, Tre’ainar’s words influenced me quite a bit, got me heated, made me think, and so on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the perspective of some people, this may also be considered brainwashing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’d like to think it’s not like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar… are you, brainwashing me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong! Dullard!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong… dullard…… now, he’s angry. Kuhahahaha. Is that so ridiculous you can’t believe it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even after this kind of exchange, even after I divulged Tre’ainar’s existence, Sadiz would only see me acting out on my own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… no way…… you can speak so casually? To the Great Demon King…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah~… Well, I asked him before if he wanted me to stop talking to him like that, right? When I did, he said being treated formally made him feel uneasy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is…… that right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz looked at me with a sad expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it doesn’t seem to be grief over the fact that my mind is finally in a sorry state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But whatever it is, I have to say this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… since I met him… I’ve been through a lot, but… now I’m …… fulfilled. And I want to keep learning from Tre’ainar and getting stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to live…… with this guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to live with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I clearly told Sadiz how I truly felt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… what…… What…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz bit her lip, her shoulders shaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell are you saying!? What…are you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She cried out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man! You’re talking about the Great Demon King who once tried to destroy the human race in this world. You asked him to teach you… spent time together… why…… in the first place, if Little man didn’t learn the Great Magic Spiral from the Great Demon King… if you hadn’t learned that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I would still be stuck in place at the Imperial Capital… rotting away with a feeling of inferiority to the princess. At least…… I wouldn’t be as strong, as you said I was.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not true … that’s not… besides … in the first place … in the first place, why is it the Great Demon King Tre’ainar!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Screaming, and glaring at me… no, Sadiz glared sharply at someone who she couldn’t see, not me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t forgive him! I hate the Great Demon King Tre’ainar, who… took everything from me… and still trying to take more! Why are you so… Little man sincerely wants… he feels that strongly…no way… There’s nothing you can do about it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Sadiz stood up, scampered around and shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be, ridiculous… i, if you’re there, come out, come out! Don’t be ridiculous! Don’t you dare take my Little man away from me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how much you shout “Come out”, Tre’ainar was here from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Sadiz can’t see him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She can’t even hear his voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not fair! Why only the Great Demon King!? The Great Demon King who took my father, my mother, my family, and my hometown and everything else, now he’s going to take Little man from me. no, way… such a thing…… I can’t allow that to happen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, Sadiz couldn’t vent her anger even if she wanted to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All Sadiz could hear was the sound of waves echoing on the empty sandy beach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, uh… why…… why!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Sadiz collapsed to her knees on the spot, shedding large tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why the Great Demon King? Why can’t I see you? How can you…… in less than a few months… raise Little man… to be so great and strong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ever since he was born… I was by Little man’s side… I loved him more than anyone else… we spent more time together than with anyone else… after taking everything from me, this time you took Little man too… how do I not resent you? How could I not hate you! How do I stop you… ugh … uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time the cool Sadiz had screamed so emotionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… if only …… I hadn’t …… remembered my past trauma at that time, if only I hadn’t …… screamed! Nothing would have changed…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly. If it hadn’t been for that incident, I might still be in the Imperial Capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz and I might not have ended up like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… Little man too… you don’t intend to return to the Imperial City… and on that journey… I can’t accompany you, can I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t …… say such a thing …… with such …… unwavering eyes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But here we are. And I’ve already decided on my answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not mad at Sadiz anymore… I’m sorry too… but…… still, I’m not going back. I’m going out into the world… just the two of us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Two people… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, with Sadiz around… I’ll get spoiled.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s how much I want it…… then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But please don’t come. I’m free to live now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. I know that, as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also remembered how much Sadiz has cherished me since I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’ll love Sadiz like this… always……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me… you want to throw me away because I’m a burden? You don’t need me anymore!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m not. I’m graduating.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t use those words! Graduating? Does that mean independence or separation from parents? Please don’t use such pretty words to fool me about going on a journey with the Great Demon King Tre’ainar!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, I also knew that Sadiz wouldn’t back down easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know she won’t break easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… is free to live? If so, this journey of freedom… do you really think… that Master and Madam… would keep silent without saying anything if they knew? Do you really think …… that I’m going to let you go quietly like this??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz stood up again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While her eyes were swollen with tears, she exposed an intense, anger intimidating feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still… you think you can dismiss me… and just go with the Great Demon King? You would choose…… the Great Demon King over us?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a swaying stance, it looked like she was ready to pounce at any moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how much I said, if it doesn’t work, I would have to use force… I was expecting such a development … I wasn’t surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if it means fighting me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to fight Sadiz alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, if Sadiz wouldn’t allow it and forcefully stood in front of me, then I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t do it!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ugh … uh … I, I should be able to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I said anything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I should be able to… but I can’t! There’s no way…… I can do …… more to make you hate me, Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no way… I could seriously fight you, Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz yelled again and sank back into the place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the same for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to fight Sadiz.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
