<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Sadiz’s answer was that she couldn’t stop it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… uh… ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The appearance of Sadis leaking sobs also tightened my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I hadn’t endured it, I might have burst into tears as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, Little man… no longer…… from now on…… doesn’t intend to go back… is that what you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The question is, “Are you ever coming back home again?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, when I ran away from the Imperial City, I was like, “I’m never going back. “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So maybe that’s the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because when I met Sadiz again, I thought about graduating from Sadiz, but I didn’t think about going back to the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I think about it again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At least at this point… I don’t feel like going home, I don’t want to go home, I don’t have a reason to go home… right now…… I don’t feel like showing my face to the people in the Imperial City…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not angry about Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m convinced that it’s unavoidable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, what of the people of the Imperial City who bombarded me with abusive miscellaneous words?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, they saw me use the Great Demon King’s technique, hitting my hero father, and brushing off the princess’ hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Them criticizing me might be inevitable, but I wasn’t motivated to just let it slide when it came to the people of the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, won’t you ever come home?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… but, the technique of the Great Demon King I used… that is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not just the use of the technique of the Great Demon King… you hitting your father… or anything else that I disagree with.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least for now, it’s not the place where I, the son of the Hero, would return to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The “reason” for rejecting the Imperial City itself is different from the disagreement with Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master, Madam! The princess and the others… they’re really worried about Little man! At least…… at least once…… just to talk…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father…… mother…… the last two people I saw…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Your father, your mother, and Sadiz love you from the bottom of our hearts! Believe me! We’re a family!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I punched my father in the face when he said that to me at the graduation match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Hey, wait, Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I came this far without ever looking back at my mother, who found me in Cantidan and desperately chased after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I could say that I’ve been running away emotionally, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like Sadiz, we’ve had our share of misunderstandings, and maybe if I explained it, my father and mother might accept me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I ever go back… at that time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That time?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When I’m more …… confident in…… myself, that’s when…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Otherwise, things will end up being the same. I don’t want that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I came out here after hitting my father… I can’t do this half-heartedly… I have to be good enough to say, ‘Look at me now, you bastard.’… or I’ll just be a hero’s son… just born into a hero’s house… I want that much confidence and achievement.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t achieved anything yet, and I want to be more… than I am now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Confidence? Achievement? Didn’t Little man become stronger? You also won in the tournament against some of the best! Even though I lost my memory, I have seen with my own eyes how much bloody effort Little man has put in here in Cacretale!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, I worked hard and got my first win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But compared to the feats of father and mother…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’m happy and proud of my win. But… it’s just a challenge, it’s not the goal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? ………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Sadiz’s eyes became sharp again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… is that what the Great Demon King told you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Little man I knew ‘before’… would be more…… festive… is the reason why you are so stoic and ambitious… because the Great Demon King told you so and Little man was influenced by him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was at a loss for words, but it was true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe I wouldn’t have thought like this when I was in the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Sadiz said, I’d be festive…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… what do … what, that is! I’m… I!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz yelled again, but immediately kept her head down in depression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me… the Master, Madam, and Little man… I love spending time with just the four of us… I’m happy… I want to get those days back again… I don’t want to lose you… I’ll definitely bring Little man home… that’s all I think about… thinking for Little man? No…… I…… I only thought about making myself happy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why!? Why is the Great Demon King… the Great Demon King… for Little man… giving advice that can help Little man grow…… accurate guidance that can make the Little man stronger… why…… didn’t I…… do that? Why… I didn’t realize the anguish of Little man… until I was cornered… I should have… why, could the Great Demon King do it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time as sadness, Sadiz was gritting her teeth with some regret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s the best… what’s good for him… what he needs… not as the Son of the Hero… as Earth Lagann, why couldn’t I… see… why couldn’t I fulfill my vow to live for Little man! Why!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She started blaming herself again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t find any words to say to Sadiz, and she took in a few rough breaths…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… now…… you two… you said it was fulfilling, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah… Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Those days… not only are you getting stronger with accurate guidance… Little man… are you also able to …… keep a smile on your face? In everyday life… having fun… properly…… are you smiling?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I able to earnestly keep smiling?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no need to think about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz would say, “Don’t be ridiculous,” and father and mother wouldn’t allow it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I spent time with Tre’ainar, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even without your memory… for three months in this country… you were watching me, weren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… Sadiz. I…… I’m having fun.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… my goodness…… how moronic… just be silent and go back… you may start over…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just couldn’t lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the last few years, I’ve never smiled like an idiot so hard, so deeply and with such fulfillment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was Sadiz disappointed with my answer? Was she dumbfounded? Would she hate me now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon King… first…… you…… why was my hometown… ~~~~tsu…… no…… wrong…… not that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The most important thing… already…… right now is… ku … uh … ugh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz started saying something, but quickly stopped herself, and instead……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon King! If you’re there, you listen! These are my one-sided remarks! No need to respond through Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Nu?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not to me, even though she couldn’t see him, Sadiz’s word were aimed at Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “On the journey ahead, if anything should happen to Little man; I will die, I will become a spirit, and I will definitely hunt you down and cast you into the depths of hell! I promise! I won’t hear any excuses!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu, nu?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m entrusting the most precious thing in the world, my Little man, to the being who took everything from me… it’s so painful that my heart is crushed… I’ve an urge to search for an exorcist even now and thoroughly search for a means to exorcise the Great Demon King from Little man… I hate you, Great Demon King Tre’ainar! Even if there was once a just cause, I will never forgive you! But… even so…… if you truly care for Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She one-sidedly gave her emotional, but bittersweet feelings, to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And you, Little man “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, looking at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t want to travel with a pretty girl… I’m not convinced, but…… no matter what happens, I’ll stand by you. Right, wrong, I don’t know anymore. Do what you want Little man… please do it to your heart’s content…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I tried to guide Little man only as the son of a hero… I failed to determine what was best for Earth Lagann… I couldn’t do anything… I’m not worthy… but… at the very least, Little man… please allow me to see you off… and pray for you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz looked at me with a mixed but lonely expression, but still trying to smile as much as she could.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That expression made me feel unbearable guilt, and at the same time, I felt like crying too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Little man. Finally… may I ask only one selfish thing for myself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz gave me her one last wish with a smile. That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can I have one last …… hug? As a way of saying goodbye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no reason for me to decline.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If so, with pleasure…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her hands slowly turned, and the warmth and calming fragrance that I have known for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, when I get wrapped up in Sadiz, my heart feels at ease.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… I used to carry you in my arms so easily… but now you’re just as tall as I am… really…… you’ve become big and strong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, have you noticed that now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I didn’t even notice that… in many ways, I’m unqualified. And the madam… she said the same thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t let her see my face now either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thanks… for everything…… and…… for seeing me off… thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think I’d ever be able to face Sadiz like this again, head on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was the one who was hurting the most right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But she still chose to see me off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t be together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man. I’ll be so happy to live in a world where I tell the Master, ‘Look at me now!’…… I’m waiting for you to become one of the world’s greatest…whenever it gets too hard…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, don’t…… ugh…… ruin it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I love you, more than anyone else in the world. I’ll always be thinking of you no matter what happens. Call on me anytime. I’ll come running even to the end of the world.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh … Sa … diz …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… hopefully――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I said “I have already cut off the past”, I really just go with what’s convenient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, would Tre’ainar ever even talk to me again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I do not mind. On occasion.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar’s voice felt very gentle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――― Part 4 Complete ―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There will be various opinions. Some may have hoped for a grand rejection. I will accept it already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Please say it to your heart’s content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, because part 4 ended up being too long, and maybe some comedy will come in after this, the mood may change, so I will break this part here once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They haven’t even set out on a journey yet, and what about Jamdi’el and Kron? I think there will be opinions on that, but I will break it off here. Excuse me.
</div>
