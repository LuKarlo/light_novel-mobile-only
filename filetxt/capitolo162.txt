<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am overcome with emotion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Long were the seconds it took to get to this point, and I tremble at the thought of the oncoming rewards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, there is still much needed for my plan, and this is merely its middle stage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, my heart is abuzz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On that day, in order to gather information, I was watching the graduation match of the Imperial City Warrior Academy through magik crystal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Never did I expect that Hiro and Mamu’s child would use the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How could he use it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who in heavens is that lad?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what was imperative, rather than unraveling the mystery, was to have the lad at hand as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fortunately, the parent-child relationship between Earth Lagann and Hiro wasn’t sound, and Earth Lagann had fled from the troublesome Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was able to find them faster than they could, and spirit him away here to Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not yet, don’t laugh yet. Lady Kron would find it strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how apt his use of the Great Demon Spiral and Breakthrough can be, he was still an unfinished great vessel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a precaution, I had thought to use Machio or José, but my concerns were unnecessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He mastered Magical Breathing and demonstrated power that surpassed even Machio’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I no longer have any complaints.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He will spawn the ideal child with Lady Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the existence that will be born between me and their conceived child is the existence that will transcend all life and be the true God who rules the Heaven, the Surface and the Demon worlds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el~ do you hear me~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no, erm, pardon me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, listen, what were you saying? Strawberries, cats, white, black, light blue, red, yellow, also many others, and I should wear nothing else. Which one would you prefer?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. After all… white would be what best suits you, Lady Kron. And for the sake of absolute victory… go with the white lace.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that so? I understand! White lace, then!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking back, how many days did it take to get here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Surface world sojourn to evade La’iphant of the Demon Realm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mikado and the rest of the allied forces have set up a network on the Surface world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was extremely difficult to escape a place of rest with the then infant Lady Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reluctantly, I sought aid from ‘Hakuki’ and the boss of the Bockmati family, ‘Inai’, and fled to this country, but everything led to today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufufufu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, Lady Kron?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Lady Kron smiled at me as I was floating away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sight of Lady Kron after her bath, with her body cleansed, made me feel a shocking lust, despite being of the same sex.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el, you look happy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, i, is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t realize that Lady Kron could see through me, was my face that obvious?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I must brace myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lady Kron is to be sent to Earth Lagann’s chambers to do the deed!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No worries. With Lady Kron’s divine cuteness, Earth Lagann should fall easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no doubt that he will dive into the bed with Lady Kron, smiling in her lingerie with a ribbon wrapped around her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, should he refuse by any chance, or even try to escape… I will not allow it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m worried. Will Earth be pleased with me… will he accept me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course! The mantra passed down from ancient books … ‘The prize is me’… no lad can decline this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I am sure.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, all is well. At the same time, I almost laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking about it, Lady Kron, who was still a baby about 498340000 seconds ago, has come so far…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Ueeeh, uuh, ueeeh, ueeeeeeeeh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Lady Kron! What’s wrong…… Oh, thou leaks… Kuh, I must change diapers again… I’m not good at this… oh, all right! It’s okay~, Lady Kron!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was feared as the Dark Valkyrie, but because I was not able to unite with God, for me who was still pure and unmarried, it was more difficult for me to raise and protect Lady Kron as a baby, than to go to war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Ugh, oh, mama…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Lady Kron, I am not thy mother, I am Jamdi’el. I am thy vassal. And what happened? Why does thou shed tears?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Why do I have horns? Why am I different from everyone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Of course. Thou is different from the monkeys out there. Thou is a chosen being with the blood of God in thy veins! So, please take care!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I don’t want to be God… I want to be normal… Jamdi’el isn’t a servant…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Lady Kron. Now, it’s time for thy studies, not to utter such nonsense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, who has never raised a disciple or a subordinate, suddenly raising such a young existence was truly difficult, even though she was a goddess with divine blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Now, Lady Kron. After this, I would like to ask thou please give the order to all the revolutionaries. Afterwards, please rest. For Machio and I will dispose of all our enemies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Yes, I understand. But please be careful, Jamdi’el. Don’t get hurt…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― There is no problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when Lady Kron had grown to some extent, we moved in earnest to take over Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I realized that Hakuki, who was stronger than me and a thorn in my side, could not move for a while, and furthermore, after the revolution was successful, the Bockmati family also perished on its own, so everything went according to my ideal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, all as if God were supporting me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, God. Are you watching over us?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nearly there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although we lost God, we will once again harbor the blood of God in the world and bring his eternal rule to the world!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Jamdi’el.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Would Jamdi’el be happy if…… I gave birth to Earth’s child?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Lady Kron, who was smiling somewhat calmly at my excitement, asked me a question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Would I be happy? The answer to that is clear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. That is what I, as thy vassal, long for.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that instant, Lady Kron appeared to be thinking about something for a moment, but she immediately smiled again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay. I’m going to have a lot～～～～～ of babies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s the spirit, Lady Kron!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even if thou should give birth to just one… nay…… considering that the child might be female, would it be necessary to conceive several children?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then Jamdi’el would be pleased, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then… yes! I will make sure to ask Earth to do it diligently! I’ll ask to do it a lot, please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happened?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first glance, she seemed enthusiastic, and I believed she was burning with her mission as a goddess, which I taught her, but it also felt a little different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nay, why does it matter if I am happy in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Jamdi’el… your wish will come true… if you are satisfied and pleased… I just want you to listen to one of my wishes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is rare. Has Lady Kron ever asked anything of me with such an expression?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no need for such a change, and if it’s Lady Kron’s order, I can do most things…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… call Jamdi’el… not by name… but in a different way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Call? What? How to call me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ummm, I’ll ask you about this another time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? No, Lady Kron, what is it? Please speak up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s fine. I’ll do this … after Jamdi’el’s wishes come true.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lady Kron uttered something, but she smiled right after without saying it in the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What does thou mean? To be called differently, is it a nickname? A moniker? I don’t understand. What was Lady Kron trying to say?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you for everything, Jamdi’el. I will do my best! Earth is a very nice boy. I will do my best to make him like me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s the spirit, however, you needn’t work so hard, that man will easily be swayed by you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, well. Now. And for some reason, Lady Kron was quite motivated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that’s the case, it would be prudent to first give priority to this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for that purpose…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, Lady Kron, I’ll take my leave for a while.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’ll go over the etiquette again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After saying that, I left Lady Kron’s room… Fufu…… a rat…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… before my heraldic eyes… there’s no point in using magik to hide… fuhahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can see things through the walls, the reach of my eyesight is vast, and I am able to see activated magical powers as colors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how miniscule.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then again… thou was also sneaking around between fights during the fighting tournament… well, I knew the other party, so I let it be, but … might as well!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I opened the window of the corridor and jumped outside, leaped over the rooftops of the city, and into the shadow of a back alley…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What have we here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is thou doing sneaking around?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, haha ​​… Master…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There stood a man with a tense smile and sweat on his cheeks, shrinking back at my presence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in his hand, a magik crystal is clenched, as if he was about to make contact with someone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Reporting in are we? Hey, Wacha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha Huacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After this, he had no desire to make an appearance at the luncheon for the fighting tournament to be held at the church, and instead sneaked off to a remote place… however, I was also taken as naive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hand over the Magik Crystal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll talk to him myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure ‘he’ will ask anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it would be better to hear it directly from my mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magik crystal glowed even though he had yet to do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This, on the contrary, indicates that communication is being sent here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, before we can get in contact with them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is I.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yo, Wa…tte!? La, Lady… Jamdi’el?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that they were going to contact Wacha from the other end, and when I suddenly appeared, I heard a sound of someone falling in surprise from beyond the magik crystal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they were quite surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… confirming the results of the fighting tournament… nay, checking on the final key?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am aware of their purpose. So I asked for confirmation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, no, that’s true too, though… just in time! An urgent message from the boss to Lady Jamdi’el. I was going to have Wacha deliver it…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I believed they sought to simply confirm the man who would be Lady Kron’s companion, but an urgent message from ‘him’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold, in the first place, where is he now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’m… simply…… just this sudden message…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch…oh, well. So?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I will deliver the words of the boss as they are. [A new king has ascended the throne of Angela Kingdom, the kingdom above the clouds].」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The message was a quandary I myself had never even considered at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Also… [In order to appeal to the people, the new king is about to make a move to capture the biggest stain in the kingdom’s history, the traitor Jamdi’el]… he said.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「[The situation of the Isolationist Nation on the Surface World doesn’t matter. Return to the Demon Realm now. All three of you, if you have found the key]… he said.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought that the past that I had abandoned hundreds of years ago would find me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch… what to do now. In the past, all the promising Valkyries sent my way were beaten, and since then, have dreadfully retreated into the clouds… but, for Hakuki to advise me to such extent…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, not everything goes as smoothly as I would have it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Must there always be some sort of trial?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But can I come this far only to end in ruin?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This country is finally working the way I want it to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, even if I return to the Demon Realm, would I be more indebted to Hakuki? That is more troubling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the answer was already there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What of it? Come if thou will, come dross Odin and the feathered worms who worship thee… and I’ll kill all of thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one will interfere with my wishes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
