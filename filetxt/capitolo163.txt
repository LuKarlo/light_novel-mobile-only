 “So, Little man. Currently, this island nation is warded off from the outside world. What do you plan to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After the hug with Sadiz, I said farewell and departed on the journey… is what I’d like to say, but reality doesn’t go that smoothly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Jamdi’el put a barrier over Cacretale, so it is impossible to go to the outside world at present.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was something I couldn’t break even if I used the Great Magic Spiral three months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m also going to have a hard time hard time outsmarting them with magic, and no doubt Jamdi’el will notice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, well, about that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The discussion I had three months ago. What Jamdi’el imposed on me was to win the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I beat Mr. Machio and won the championship just like she wanted, now as she promised…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis not just the victory, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I remembered that too, but I didn’t want to mention it in front of Sadiz, so I didn’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong, Little man? Did the Great Demon King say anything?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz narrowed her eyes at my reaction. Obviously, it’s a scornful glare.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm … oh no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the conditions that Jamdi’el gave me. That was “Winning” and “Helping with something”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The “something” was ambiguous, but it was clearly related to Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Kron and… somethingsomething-like…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… By the way, Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm … about the demon named Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… what’s that reaction?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I thought she read my mind. Involuntarily, I was surprised to hear it out loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el serves her… even more…… her face… I once saw the Great Demon King when I was very young…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Oh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, how much do you know about her, Little man? What does the Great Demon King know? And…… the state of Jamdi’el right after the tournament……she even wants Little man to eat something that would increase his vigor…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah, uh huh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… do you know what comes after this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I haven’t heard it directly, it’s just a guess, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… well, Little man has already graduated from me, no matter what he does or where he does it and with whom, I have no right to interfere…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I squinted a little… what the heck, for a moment… an old feeling came over me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I wonder why. Sadiz said she doesn’t want to pursue me too deeply, but she was flustered after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, w, well… I’ll talk to Kron rather than Jamdi’el. She’s a little bit of a careless natural airhead, but if we talk calmly, I feel like she can understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… nonetheless Jamdi’el won’t stay silent on the situation…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Three months ago. Jamdi’el’s strength was so far beyond mine that there was nothing I could do about it, no matter how I tried to reverse it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I had no choice but to obey quietly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man. The opponent is one of the Six Supremacy, right? She once stood against the Master and Madam… a monster that left a mark in history, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, even though I’ve become stronger, I’m not going to pretend that I’m capable of defeating Jamdi’el, who was a Six Supremacy of the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… to be left helpless and unable to resist… let alone, silently killed… no way in hell am I going to let that be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What does the Great Demon King say? Naturally, you are well aware of Jamdi’el’s power, right? How much of a difference is there between her and Little man today…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, in a ‘proper’ fight, even for the current child, victory will be impossible… however…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… he possesses some ability and experience, so he can at least read the opponent’s power but … Jamdi’el is unfathomable. With the child as he is, it cannot be done… said the Great Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Still… she will not kill the child who can even use Magical Breathing… that is certain. Besides…… for Jamdi’el…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, if the Great Demon King was worried about Little man’s safety even for an instant, he would have said that more strongly and raised his sense of crisis …… so the fact that there is no sign of that, is there something? For example, does Jamdi’el have any weaknesses?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, there is a weakness. Jamdi’el has… a fatal flaw… something that even Hiro and his companions were unaware of.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But even if there was a weakness…… it would still be too dangerous… the other party is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a wall that must be overcome eventually. Although, tis reckless to merely delve in without thinking… tis necessary to know the power of the opponent, know the power of the self, and still challenge.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still, having Little man fight Jamdi’el… as guidance… eh, but… no…… Little man already trusts that guidance, and I’ve never done anything…but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah… are they? Sadiz shouldn’t be able to perceive Tre’ainar’s appearance or voice, but it felt like a subtle conversation has been established…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Are the people who care about me naturally connected to the conversation?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it was a coincidence, but I almost laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be inappropriate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz hasn’t forgiven Tre’ainar, and reconciliation is out of the question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, through my existence… is it egotistical of me to think so?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I also felt a little happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go back to church for now, Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sure they’ll be waiting for us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, for now, if I can’t leave now, let’s go back to church once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, it looks like we’re having a launch party today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it alright to be so optimistic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It matters not. This was never the goal for the child. But it was a triumph worth the effort.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… I also want to celebrate Little man’s victory…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, you guys are actually talking, aren’t you? I think you can see each other!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost made a retort but held it back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… even if you graduate from me… today is like a victory party, so… my home cooking… can you eat it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Yes…… Of course, I’d love to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… then…… let’s do that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz seemed to have broken down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She nodded to me, with a conflicted smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it, Sadiz? Suddenly, you sighed…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… it’s just…… really…… Little man… to think you’re all grown up… it’s frustrating.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You think so? Well, I wasn’t only training… after I left the Imperial City… I’ve had a lot of encounters and experiences…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While walking alongside me on the beach, Sadiz spoke so keenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… between the time you left the Imperial City and you coming here… come to think of it, you also visited Cantidan, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, did you meet a Ninja Warrior from Japone, a woman… kept calling Little man Honey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? That… no way… Shinobu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nfufufufufu~, it seems you’re becoming an adult in that aspect… what was it? Did the Great Demon King also teach you how to seduce women?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you’re wrong… Shinobu was… before that… in Honeyborough…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honeyborough?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, there’s also Mr. Aka, he’s an Ogre, and a good friend…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? O, Ogre!?.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, I was talking about everything that had happened since I left the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… supposing, if you don’t mind… I’d like to hear about the… encounters and experiences in your time away from us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, it’s no problem.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the walk back to church wasn’t enough to tell the story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I told Sadiz as if I was bragging.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything that happened before I came to Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To which Sadiz nodded seriously, but with a smile on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was happy to be able to spend such a casual moment with Sadiz again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday I was in a state of distraction in many ways. As you may know if you’re following my Twitter feed, the night before yesterday I was exhausted. Until now, I’ve been writing because Japan won and I’ve been fired up, but I’ve been so moved that the opposite happened, I couldn’t write. I was so excited that I couldn’t do anything else, so I drank until morning … but I didn’t enter the detention center, right? I didn’t jump into a roadside ditch, okay? I was simply having a full rest yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the goal was still ahead, it was a good night to float.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 * When I woke up in the morning, there was a review called “Spirit”! Thank you! It woke me up at once!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
