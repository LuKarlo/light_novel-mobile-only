 “Ah, he’s back! Hey, you’re late!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I returned to the church, the area around the entrance was already crowded with people, including around the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, wow…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is, really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… a festival?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tables are lined up and the food is served on many platters, making it look like a standing room only party.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can feel the excitement from the people who have already gathered, and in some places, musical instruments were being played.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Karui noticed me and Sadiz and raised her voice, the other people who had gathered there all greeted me with smiles and applause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, he’s here, nova boy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, congratulations!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Congratulations!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was applause in the arena, but at that time I was swallowed by the excitement of the match, and I could easily go with the flow to raise my voice and wave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, once I calmed down, I was more confused when I was suddenly hit with this much heat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One after another, the guy of the dojo, the sisters, and the uncles and aunts in town whose names I didn’t even know were applauding, clapping my shoulders and shaking my hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you’re here! Excuse me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heave-Ho!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Make way for Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breaking through such a crowd, Mortriage’s crew came rushing to me, and without my consent, the four of them lifted me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, y, you guys! Stop it! It’s embarrassing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was one head above the crowd, overlooking everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those at the end of the crowd were also looking at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was embarrassed, ashamed, but my heart was pounding and I was half smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man has come so far… uuuugh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I do not mind rewarding his efforts, still this seems a tad excessive…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz and Tre’ainar quietly watched over me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “People in this country don’t seem to know that Little man is the son of a hero. In the Empire, no one could see Little man without preconceptions, not even me. But… fufufu… you found it, Little man. A place where you can be seen… as yourself…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, Sadiz seemed deeply moved and was crying a bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, why is this happening?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahaha, you’re finally back~, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Elder Sis Tsukshi! What’s this all about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ahead of us, as I was carried and taken down the road, Elder Sis Tsukshi was smiling wryly in an apron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, Elder Sis Tsukshi said that she would cook a lot of treats at the celebration today, but I never imagined this scale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At best, I thought they would invite some friends and acquaintances to the church cafeteria.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this level is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know, a lot of people brought in gifts saying ‘This is for Earth’, and it was too much for just us, so before long… this~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come, come, the guest of honor will be in the middle! The whole city’s going to be in an uproar, and I’m going to be very busy! I’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’m hoping Big sister Sadiz’s will help me out soon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi already looked very busy, but also somewhat happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was also called, so she hurriedly wiped away her tears and ran up with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older Brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this time, Amae came running up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the plate in her hand was a salad with vegetables on it, though it looked a little clunky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Amae”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, Older Brother, Amae, cooked it, I cooked! Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Amae puffed her chest with a smug face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh huh, it’s a dish that makes the most of the ingredients. Uh huh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t really, like vegetables much… no……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I see. Then I’ll have a bite.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have a fork right now, so I just use my hand. I pick up a tomato with dressing on it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, the taste of the ingredients and her cuteness should create a synergistic effect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh… it’s delicious, Amae. Thank you. You’re so good at it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mufuu! Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing that, she snorted and seemed happy. Oh, maybe today I could eat as much vegetables as I want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Karui. Where’s Mr. Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s still recovering in bed. When he uses that power, he won’t be able to move properly for a few days…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Well, I’ll check on him later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Mr. Machio won’t be here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Then again, Wacha’s not here either?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 José… doesn’t matter, enough of that for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean… what the heck! Most of the guys I faced in the tournament aren’t here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I see glimpses of the other guys, there aren’t many people who fought against me, it’s a bit of a lonely situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I’m a little worried that Wacha isn’t there… that guy… there was something I wanted to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, you’re not satisfied with just me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, chug this down!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Jawara, who I fought in the second round. Apparently, he’s the only one who showed up, and he gave me a cup with a smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the other contestants gradually began to gather around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look look, what are you upset about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, drink up! Wanna touch my bottom?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe Machio lost… but my crotch won’t lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absolutely, I’ll have to rewrite the data again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the tournament was over, and the battle was over, and there was no friend or foe, everybody was laughing and having fun like idiots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first I was a little confused by the mood, but then I started to enjoy it and decided to just drop it and join the frolic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Alright, then, cheers!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””OOOOOOOOOOOOOOeehhh!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I crudely bumped cups with these annoying grown men, and just took the drink that was handed to me in one gulp… hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 W, hat!? No, what is this smell!? That? It’s chilly, but my body is getting nice and warm…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What … Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait a minute! Isn’t he only 15?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… th, that’s not good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jawara, you idiot! What are you doing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… th, this is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ayye~? Wha is~? The world~ is shaking~?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hold on, ch, child!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? There seems to be some kind of commotion at… Little man!? Your face is red, wait, what is?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eerr? What’s wrong with big brother!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older Brother?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait a minute, quick Big Sister Sadiz… its Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmmm… things are getting really fun. But it’s so hot. Everyone’s spinning around in threes and fours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can’t be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuuuk, too hot… I’m gonna undress.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Wai, h, heeeeeeey!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, kid! Why… well, if you want to take it off, take it off!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, all of a sudden! Alright! I’ll take mine off too! I won’t lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Take off the clothes. Fold em. Hurray!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuh, you! this child and alcohol… unsavory, tis just like time with Bro…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, big brother!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~…… it’s swishy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! What are you doing in front of everyone?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Oh, everyone look… oh, Sadiz. Yes, it’s Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man! Just hold on to me, ah~, come on, somebody get some water! And, Little man, it’s not safe for you to be naked!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fiiiiiiinnee, I, wanna ask a favor, Sadiz!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? A favor… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right~, why are being so silly? Sadiz~, you promised~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “P, promised… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Geez, did you forget Sadiz? You made it to me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If don’t keep your promise, you can’t bye bye me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For winning, boobies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, ehh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I win, I can do as I like with boobies!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
