 Sadiz’s bursting boobies!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Wai…………… haaaaaah!!?? B, bo, boob… what are you saying!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been working hard to massage em! I’ve been dreaming of those holy titties since I was a kid!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L, little… that…… uh… uh~… no, it was a promise, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? You promised, Big Sister Sadis!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, big brother, seriously!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother likes boobies?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eeeeeh!? There was such an extra prize!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sheesh~, so annoying~… all of you~!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, what was all that hugging, reconciliation and breakup talk earlier about?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Heh~, what’s up with Tre’ainar? Why can’t I go for Sadiz’s titties?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s fine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because… cause…… I…… can’t help it, Imma boy!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””This guys no good, something has to be done, a new hero had just been born!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No~, it’s not no good. It’s the world that’s spinning in circles right now that’s no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… control your breathing and drink water…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yesh~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dullard, do not speak to me aloud!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mmm, it’s fine~ … I wanna talk more~…… I won the championship, praise me more.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, please praise me more master~. I reeaaly did my beeest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah~, you persevered you did your best…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “More~, umm, I…… don’t tell anyone, kay? Actually, I the happiest when you praise me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fah!? Ah … ga … m… mo, moron! Y, your sudden declaration brings me no joy! Or rather, tis why you should cease addressing me this instance!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh~, why you fuming~? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I like talking with Tre’ainar~…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wa, waitaminit, this is seriously bad! He’s suddenly talking to himself…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… you’re hallucinating…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somebody, water. Bring water!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, jeez, look, big brother! Water! Drink it down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Water~? Oh~, Karui has water~, gulp gulp ~, ah~ good… so good……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… talking to himself? No… ‘when’? ‘you’? ‘praise me’ … ‘happiest’? …… eh!?! N, no way… The Great Demon King… guh…… what a… as expected…… this is unbearable!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What’s wrong~? What’s that scary look on Sadiz’s face?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~…… ah~, chilled water is so good~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah? What was it before? What… oh yeah…… tte?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah…hmm? I, eh, just now, doing what? Boobies?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Oh? Wait, wait, I can’t get my head around this… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? You cur…… indeed…… I see. Tis your second time partaking in alcohol, so you have gained some resistance, or have you recovered a little sobriety?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recovered? No, my head still hurts, but… wait a bit, feel like I’m going to vomit, but… what the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t feel good. My head hurts. I got a little carried away with the whole “do whatever you want” thing, but that’s not right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I…… why would I do that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nfufufu, yes, Little man… certainly…… I made such a promise. Oh my? What’s wrong with you? Little man. Your face suddenly turned pale, didn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I saw Sadiz’s signature smile, I felt a sense of intimidation, or rather I felt the air at absolute zero, my fever gradually cooled down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The buzzing and the commotion around me started to become vaguely recognizable…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then… the promise was for winning the graduation match… well, this victory is comparable to that… no, it surpasses that. In fact, with Little man’s current ability, victory in the graduation match would have been a cinch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, this, might be bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, what is this? This nostalgic feeling. When Sadiz found an ero-book I was hiding, didn’t she make me sit on the floor and give me a lecture?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “However, it was inappropriate for you to say that in public like this, wasn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, when I noticed, my body… my instinct naturally pushed me, and I sat on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No. When I was drunk last time, I didn’t remember much, but now I’m reasonably conscious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I’m scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, th… that’s different!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes? Little man… what’s the difference?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah damn ah damn ah damn! Sadiz was quite angry… anyway, I have to apologize and somehow dodge the issue!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know, I, I was a little drunk when I said that… but I’m all right now! Yes, I’m sorry!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that old promise, it’s got to be a joke. After all… something like, b, boo… even if you don’t… I’ve received your full feelings!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ah, suddenly he’s a wuss…””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shut uuuuuup! I mean, in this situation, that’s all I can say—―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I straightened up in haste.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, alcohol is really dangerous. No matter who you are, no matter the hero, no matter the noble status, alcohol has always been able to ruin everything accumulated so far in an instant. It’s been a common occurrence for a long time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At such times, everyone makes excuses like, ‘I was drunk’, but it doesn’t matter whether they were drunk or not. Rather, the words that come out when drunk and loose of reasoning are the true nature of that person. People around you will recognize that as your human nature.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This time, Little man was so elated by his victory, that he even said things that he didn’t mean to say… maybe that was unavoidable, but that’s what I think because it’s me, it is not always possible for other people to judge you as I would. On the contrary, there may have been some people who were disappointed with Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “People often hear the word ‘free and easy gathering’ in a setting like this… that doesn’t mean that everything is irresponsible. Of course, how you behave and what you say come with responsibility. Some people may forgive ‘boobs’ as a joke after getting drunk with alcohol, while others will not. So if you’re not forgiven, won’t they naturally be angry about it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… es…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt despondent and showed some remorse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, even though I was drunk, why did you make the promise five months ago… mostly, I’ve had enough of boobs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I dreamed of Sadiz’s boobs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, enough, I don’t want to hear about em anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Generally speaking, Shinobu’s chest is not devastating at all, but she’s a good person and a beautiful woman… and Kron is really cute… well, I haven’t done anything with those two yet… no, but Shinobu confessed to me, also… I think Kron will come to my room tonight… but I can’t say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That kind of thing…… that’s… starting with the exchange diary, we then get matching accessories, share a single umbrella as a couple, carve our names on lockets, attach them somewhere, and ring the bells on a hill together… that’s right…… boobs will be an event after becoming a man and a woman who finished going through the process!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted it as an extra prize for winning, and I was wrong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the beginning…… I…… was wrong……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In any case… I’ll give you a little talk in your room.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuo!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Sadiz grabbed my arm and dragged me away while emitting a terrifying aura with a very nice smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know when she picked it up, but she was holding my clothes that I had taken off and folded under her arm… I’m naked!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, they’re thin, but her arms are strong. Resistance? No, now I’m more afraid of going against her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um… Big Sister Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, big brother was just playing a prank, like that ―――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eeehhh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that would have been what everyone gathered here thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The contestants and the people in the dojo were also speechless, their faces involuntarily pulled into a grimace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though there are people who are far stronger than ordinary, no one could resist Sadiz with one of her pressured smiles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, with no one to help me, eventually I was dragged into my room…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar was somewhat silent, but with a huge squint in his eyes, like he’s dumbfounded… no, say something!? Your silence hurts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~…… now…… Little man”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz threw me into the room that I have been using for the last three months, and even locked the door with a click.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… I, I’m sorry… really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That was a little carried away… and I’m really sorry …… for acting so disgraceful…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sat upright on the floor and bowed my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a terrifyingly shameful sight. Pathetic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it’s okay. I apologized honestly when I should apologize.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ha~…… really…… at such a place, in the end Little man is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz then… passed beside me and … huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sat on the bed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… I’m not particularly mad… argh, but you shouldn’t say that in such a situation… in the first place… a promise is … a promise.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As I said earlier…… naturally, what you say comes with responsibility… let alone, if it’s a promise…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That being the case… by all means…… Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fueh!? …… eh?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
