 Tre’ainar called the ladder training a “warm up”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw it as a “preparatory exercise”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this is far beyond that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hee, Hee… Tssh… Physically I’m strong, but… Ha, ha… the preparation exercise might kill me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Usually, I think of the preparation exercise as the act of loosening the body and a light warm up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But far from loosening up, my legs muscles have cramped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perform the ladder training every day. And even after the graduation games of course.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “R-Really… Eeh, my legs… My thighs are jerking. My feet are sore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Familiarize yourself. And make it a daily routine. Once tis a habit, you will feel unwell any day you do not perform it. If that happens, there will no longer be an issue.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “E-Every day? I’ll end up a masochist.” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Precisely. Punish yourself, indulge yourself, intoxicate yourself, and give yourself the addiction. That is to say, become a masochist, a narcissist, and an addict.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ended up spending a lot of time on the Magical Ladder training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little by little, I seem to be getting the hang of it, but I still can’t do it perfectly, so I’ll have to work it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for being called a preparatory exercise, it’s scary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, next on the training schedule, you will be instructed on body techniques. But before that… have you ever studied any Martial Art?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And next is martial art. Or rather, it’s a full-fledged training from here on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Once, only as a basis. We don’t even spar at the academy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That so. Then, first of all, show me some of your motions.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Motion?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm……Shadow…… No, ……’sparring’. Yes, do some ‘Phantom Sparring’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, Phantom? Ghosts? He’s saying terms I don’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, are you unaware? Shadows are a staple of martial art training. Tis supposed to be an imaginary enemy you face on your own, and train to avoid attacks with kicks, fists and so on.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho-u…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Sparring is a mock battle in which an actual opponent is prepared. And now, what I have just thought of, the Phantom Sparring. Not a virtual enemy. Not even a real partner. You are going up against a ghost with no substance.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I didn’t know what the difference was. I’ll be sparring with ghosts, not imaginary enemies? With ghosts… Ghost?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. It shall be me. We shall spar on the assumption that my form actually exists.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Oh, I… with you…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. Come at me with intent to kill. Instead, even if no damage is given, I shall fight back as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, a sparring match with the Great Demon King. Sure, I can’t touch him, but we can simulate combat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, this might be fun! Isn’t this good? Let’s do it. Let’s see how great the martial art of the Great Demon King is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it seems much more effective than sparing alone assuming an imaginary enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m also interested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King’s martial art.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, how well can I fight against the Demon King?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey. Then you won’t pretend my attacks didn’t land when they actually did, will you? If I score a hit, you should declare it yourself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got a little excited, ringing my fist joints, forgetting the fatigue of my legs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, against me, Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahahahahaha. Even for a genius, the chances of that is zero.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you actually think your attacks can hit?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the atmosphere changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I involuntarily breathe in the invisible pressure that seemed to crush my moment of enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, attack from anywhere. I don’t mind you using magic?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sparring match with the Great Demon King!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the opponent is a ghost, and there is no damage to me even if he fights back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is absolutely impossible to die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. What happened? Afraid of me, perhaps?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A simulated combat? I’m about to fight the Demon King now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I realized that, and the moment Tre’ainar stood in front of me, I felt a cold sweat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No one will die… there will be no injury. There should be nothing to be afraid of.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it so different just by standing in front of me in any form with the intention of “fighting”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it so scary to confront an enemy that should be harmless?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well…… even if there is no death or injury… you may end up with a vision of such.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, I can imagine it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s a feeling like somehow lives are on the line, even though I know I’m not going to die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so heavy, painful, and cold that just looking at his eyes makes my consciousness seem far away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An overwhelming sense of intimidation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar who usually listens to my conversations and talks normally… scares me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is something wrong, coward? Tis what everyone is saying about you, right? Those words you hate the most.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Still, you are only the hero-』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as usual he raises my motivation, and inflates my fighting spirit!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-Be quiet! It’s annoying! Let’s do this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… He seems smarter than his father… are the simpler parts still the same… But, that is the first step.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooooooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how much your fighting spirit, it is impossible to overturn it as well. You can’t overturn reality!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial Fluid Art, 【Rapid Flying Swallow Fist】(Hyaren Hienken)!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I start off and got in with a series of left fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The high speed lefts which goes out at irregular trajectories to disrupt the opponent…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmp,hmp”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While glancing at all my movements, he quickly evaded my fists. Without moving one step away from the spot, on the contrary, he only moved his upper body to avoid them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t be surprised at that now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After making sure he was fully concentrating on the left fist -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Take this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right low kick! Enters —
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? …… Ah… Wha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that it? Are you even trying?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I tried to kick out, something blocked my vision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Tre’ainar’s fingers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmp, there is no damage, but instinctively did you realize? Had I have taken even one more step, your eyes would have been crushed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… eh… Naa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t alert, but I couldn’t make any sense of the movement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My vision suddenly darkened, and it took me a while to understand that Tre’ainar’s fingers were in front of both my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time… After taking some distance again……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thunder Spell, 【Kilo Thunder】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the opponent is a spirit body, there will be no damage, but he should still be able to be deprived of sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll hit Tre’ainar with thunder from the sky after taking some distance on the backstep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, I’ll pursue. Break his footing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terra Spell, 【Kilo Ground Crack】!” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Considering your rather rebellious character, surprisingly your performance tends towards the royal road.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While Tre’ainar was wrapped in the lightning flash that fell into the garden, I thought I would cause a light crack in the ground with my feet that would swallow him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”……EH!…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Come now, no need to hold back. Keep trying.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When… behind me… Did he go around?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was behind me, faster than I distanced myself in the back step.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, wha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t be scared. Because the opponent is the Great Demon King… this is rather…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… Tis a pretty straightforward attack. Hence easy to read, there is no surprise. But, this much should be enough now.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A series of left and right fists, back fist from the swing, a high kick from his blind spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, all my attacks have been seen through and avoided.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s nothing to do with my opponent being a ghost, I can’t seem to land any of my attacks!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… tis limited to the era when I was alive, but… have you already attained the power of an Intermediate Warrior? I also discovered that Earth is proficient with Thunder attribute magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Inexperienced in martial art, combat logic, magic power… does not approach the Heroes of those days, but you still have more talent than the norm.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A word of praise while avoiding my attacks with a slight margin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I’m not happy at all when I’m told in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『After all, what is regrettable is that you lack actual combat experience or the opportunity to frequently dive into the battlefield as in the era of war. That is why you are constantly told, ‘You are not reliable compared to the previous generation.’』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S-Shut up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes! Silence them! All around you! The world! Everything!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t shrink from this, I will land a hit, even if it’s a single blow you will eat one of my attacks. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But, tis clear to me now. And so…… take this as an experience.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I will not touch you, I will not kill you, I will not hurt you, I will break your spirit and have you kneel.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From that point on, honestly I didn’t really understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Come on, experience firsthand! A glimpse of the power of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I knew this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was killed many times in a Phantom Battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Well, considering who he’s in love with…… Win-Win I’d say…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] I will be following takumidante’s suggestion and use Terra for Earth Attribute magic. Even the author seems to opt for Soil instead of Earth, so he may be aware of the conundrum. He caused an earthquake with this though, lot more than just ‘Soil’!
