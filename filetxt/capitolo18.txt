 I don’t remember what happened afterwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in the fight against the insubstantial ghost, I was instilled a vision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of my neck twisted with a hand sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of my heart being pierced with one finger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of being punched in the face with a counter against my fist attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of every bone in my body being broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of being kicked in the knee and then the face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All my martial art was put out, I was killed, and the image of being destroyed was imprinted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried to fight back, but it was in vain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His movements seem to be the final form of the steps from the ladder training, and sometimes he’s able to set counters against my attacks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the end, I ignored all the basics and the body techniques I had learned in the academy, and I simply lost myself to a child-like tantrum which left me ridiculously exposed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haa, ha… the heck…… What’s going on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not much time has passed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The evening light is still in the sky, not yet night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, after a few hours, Sadiz should come to get me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that she’s not coming means it has not been that long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I felt intense fatigue as if he had been fighting for hours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, have you been killed too much as expected? Well, was this little enough to revise your opinion of me?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar looks down at me with a cool face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, it seems the basic of basics in martial art have been imprinted. Later, add a shadow into your daily routine while looking into a mirror, all other physical training is just a matter of sparring.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I can’t make a fool of him anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, it’s like “Even if you die and become a ghost, you can easily kill them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I didn’t actually die, I was able to experience the feeling of actually dying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Okay? We will also spar like this every day from now on. If you experience my movement and overwhelming strength every day, there will be nothing to fear from those children there.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m fighting him every day… Somehow, my senses will change in various ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s pretty… hard master.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Did you think you could become stronger so easily? In order to become stronger in a short period of time, the duration of frustration must also be denser.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I guess… that’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With such a wide range of contents, I was worn out and started to fall asleep on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, there must have been a curse, but… I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What happened? Could it be, did disappointment in your ability lead you to lose your fighting spirit?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… I’m so weak, I’ve never thought that till today…And, It’s as if…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was killed many times, was aware of my weakness many times, and I was reminded of his mercy many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the more I knew about the greatness of the Demon King Tre’ainar, the more I thought of another thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… said my father he was obscene and couldn’t read the mood.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I thought while being beaten… it was about my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Yes. If it was one-on-one, I would have won the battle, but that man…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As always, Tre’ainar looks irritated, as he still thinks my father is abhorrent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there’s no foul or fair in war, but I understand his feelings enough to call it a grudge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… even if it’s so… even if my father was cowardly and couldn’t read the mood… still, you and my father fought.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Oh…… Perhaps, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unlike me now, if I fight, I’ll be killed… I’ll be hurt… I’ll be destroyed… against you, if your form actually existed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason I was still facing him was because Tre’ainar was a ghost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason that there was only a feeling and not actually been killed, injured and destroyed in the true sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I’m still such a mess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what about my father?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My father… stood up to a ridiculous monster, like you, and survived?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not a question of whether father defeated the Great Demon King, or whether his means to do so were obscene and he couldn’t read the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He stood up to something like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the risk of his life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… would he face?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For humanity?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You really… you know nothing of Hiro.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what Tre’ainar said to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, to be honest, I don’t know how strong my father really is, in fact…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Not at all.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 About my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The first thing you should do is… rather than knowing the power of Hiro as a hero, rather than surpassing Hiro as a hero… first of all, comprehend the path that Hiro took to become a hero.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is not a father called a hero, but a life that has been accumulated by walking it until the father became a hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『People ask you to be ‘the Son of the Hero’, but… he himself, while abominable to me, would not have walked a smooth route, at least, to be a ‘Hero’. If they believe your ‘Hero’ father could always face it without fear, they are mistaken.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don’t know the process because I only know the result of my father defeating the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, as I currently am against such overwhelming difference in power, ‘Why did I face it?’ I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whatever you say…… My father is just busy, and that’s what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Did you not even try to find out? Did you investigate it yourself?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… T-That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I understand you do not face the man often … but did you not, in one way or another, get acquainted with your father?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never tried to find out for myself. I didn’t want to know that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I had said things like, ‘Well, teach me the sword, give me your sword’, but as soon as I was told that it was no good, I pulled away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, I hated being told, ‘Our era was…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the old days, if it was said that it would not be helpful because the times are different from the present, then will the old story be helpful, or perhaps tis simply a boast, or do you want to learn what can be learned from it in the present age…that is, it may change depending on the attitude of the listener.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was made to think about Tre’ainar’s words, who can tell that I dislike preaching related to old stories.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, about my father…will you tell me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be silly. You should inquire about your father yourself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Ha, you’re right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, I never thought I’d be interested in my father in this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, but right now he’s so busy, he doesn’t have time, my father… even if I met him on occasion, I could only say that he had been uncooperative. If he had a little time… then I’ll ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You too… tell me if you feel like it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s also about the guy who’s looking at me now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The history of the battles between these two people. I simply wanted to know that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, I am always indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, I got a nice review.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to update it more and more in the tension explosion.
</div>
