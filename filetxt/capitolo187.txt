 “Kron, are you okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, It’s just a little prickly, nothing’s wrong. If I say it hurts because of this, everyone will laugh at me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And … um…… what did you call this? It was my first time being pricked… yes, this was my defloweri――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s totally different! So, please don’t say such a thing to anyone, you’ll cause a misunderstanding!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron nodded with a hearty smile that said there’s no need to worry about anything. She had a little bandage on her finger, which I had carried for the Magical Vantage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s blood was needed for the summoning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dropped it on the magic circle, and now we’re ready.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Good Grief… right, Tre’ainar… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Then I will teach you the chant. Also, be prepared. To forcibly summon such a dragon, it will consume enough magic power for the Great Demon Spiral all at once… well, as you can use Magical Breathing now, it should prove no problem… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Okay.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve heard that you usually don’t need so much magic power just to summon a creature that has made a contract with you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to summon them so casually.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what I’m about to do is ancient magic like Tre’ainar’s secret technique, and what I will summon is a legendary monster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, I’m starting to get very nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if it suddenly attacks or goes on a rampage?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, Earth! Let’s summon Vasalar!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Kron was snorting “Hun, Hun” with a sense of excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This girl doesn’t seem to have any idea of the anxiety I’m feeling over here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this really okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it comes down to it, I’ll have to protect her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rest assured, he is not one to suddenly rampage indiscriminately.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, Tre’ainar said we didn’t have to worry, so let’s be prepared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Alright! Let’s do this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We “three” got into the spirit. And I listened to Tre’ainar with all my magic power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The chant goes… Ama~ažo~o ŗaķuŧeń’ńu ŷaħoďeŧŝu ħańŝağa ŵaŷamaŧo ħaiŧaŧŝu! Forced Summon Magic, 【Sokjeetz】!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ama~ažo~o ŗaķuŧeń’ńu ŷaħoďeŧŝu ħańŝağa ŵaŷamaŧo ħaiŧaŧŝu! Forced Summon Magic, 【Sokjeetz】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whole magic circle lit up at once, starting from the spot where Kron’s blood was dropped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also felt as if all the magic power was being drained from my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing! It’s glowing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic circle emitted a more intense light than I have ever seen before, and at the same time the space cracked like glass, and finally shattered into pieces to reveal the darkest darkness…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s coming!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something huge emerged from the darkness beyond the space that was ruptured by the light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I felt an intense chill run through my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah … uh … ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s this feeling? Fear? I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why, but …… even though I’m just here, my whole life was flashing before my eyes… the faces of my father, mother, and Sadiz suddenly came to my mind… what the hell is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shivering cold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I was sweating like a waterfall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh? Heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dragon appeared… or so I thought. But it wasn’t a dragon that came out of the darkness, but a huge horned cow that I have never seen…? No, a beast I’ve never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The huge beast with a huge body and fur was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why? Who dares forcibly summon me during my meal? Where is th’ oaf?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eeh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An even bigger monster was grabbing the corpse of the giant beast that I had never seen before… no, the dragon finally put its whole body in front of us with a grumpy voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuh~… making meal of a ferocious carnivore such as a behemoth… as usual.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Be, behemoth? Somehow, it’s the same name as the outrageous monster that appeared in so many novels and picture books!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the problem was not that, it was the even bigger monster that appeared with such a monster grasped in one hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its whole body was covered with vermilion scales, with sharp three-pronged horns, fangs that chewed everything up, and claws that could tear through anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were a good number of wild dragons in this world, but it’s probably nothing like any of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t lump them all together under the term “dragon”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just a monster, that’s all I can say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~? … What? Blue sky? Th’ Sun? Is this th’ Surface world? …… hmm…… some strange clouds, but… hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, my eyes met with the monster that was looking down at us. That alone made my knees tremble and I almost fell on my behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was different from any creature I’ve ever encountered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huge…… it wasn’t just about the physique… a sense of intimidation? An aura? Anyway, everything was too big for me to make sense of anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Jamdi’el as an opponent didn’t evoke this feeling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th’ only person who could summon me is th’ deceased Tre’ainar… did you use ancient magic? Humhum…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The monster looked at us both as if it were inspecting us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You never know what could end up being your last words. If you offend this entity even a little, you could instantly be…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar…… are you really sure…… this is okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hello, how do you do. My name is Kron. Nice to meet you, Great Vasalar, Dragon King of Hades?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ts Heeeeey!? Kron!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, Kron, unaware of my feelings, gave a greeting by picking up both ends of her skirt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey hey hey hey! I mean, why? Kron, aren’t you scared? Are you smiling?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can say with confidence that…… this here…… in a sense, is a big shot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~, I thought it would be a rude one to summon me so suddenly, but you’re a sweet young lassie. Yesh, it’s nice to meet you … well … you look familiar.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I thought that it would get angry at her for speaking without permission, but rather the monster showed a pleasant reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the monster nodded…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So? I’m called Vasalar, after all, but are you th’ one who summoned me? Milady?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar! After all, this is the Dragon King of Hades… obviously. If this wasn’t the Dragon King of Hades, who would it be?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This…… this is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. I only cooperated and it was Earth here that summoned you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hoh~…… a human?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the Dragon King of Hades shifted his eyes to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What are you trying to do? What are you looking at?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So? Will th’ laddie of th’ pair…… not give his greeting?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m Earth! Earth Lagann! Nice to meet you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was close! Also, what would have happened if I had been even a moment late with my greeting? No matter what happened, it wouldn’t be strange, so I was truly panicked now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What do you mean…… pair?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no, and I’m not… we’re not paired.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Paired? What’s a pair? Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s, like a married couple…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Yes, Earth and I aren’t married yet! We’re planning to start off as friends.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not the issue, but…come on, you should be a little more nervous!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tsu, what are we talking about, I mean, what? I’m too panicked to think straight, and I couldn’t understand a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then Vasalar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What~, so sickly-sweet~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, it reacted like a strange neighborhood uncle that habitually bantered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I would soon find out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This monster with a strong presence…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About me… what d’you intend of me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eeh?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, this was the legendary Dragon King of Hades.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] We have a Giant talking dragon (who might still transform into a human shaped loli), and the first thing that came to mind was the Movie Dragonheart, where Sean Connery voiced the Dragon. Hence I tried implying a Scottish Accent in Vasalar’s Dialogue (which might be ruined if the loli thing actually happens). Also Vasalar is my play on the name Basara (バサラ), which means acting without restraint, self-indulgence, or being pretentious.
