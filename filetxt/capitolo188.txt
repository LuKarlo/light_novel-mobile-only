 “Jamdi’el of the Six Supremacy, a former subordinate the Great Demon King Tre’ainar, was taken to the Heavenly Realm. I want to go there, but I have no means. Will you take me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please, Vasalar. Could you help us?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and I explained the situation and bowed so as not to offend the other party.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After hearing our story, Vasalar threw away the bones of the behemoth he had eaten, then slowly looked up at the sky and squinted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar’s subordinate… oh, one of those six. That said, I only remember two… Oh I see. I didn’t have any interest in th’ Demon King Army after Tre’ainar died, so I left it alone… was a surviving executive taken… hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And after listening to our story a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah… I’m not interested.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To our pleas, Vasalar threw a brief refusal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we were in no position to ask, “why not?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From his point of view, he was probably thinking, “What’s with this guy summoning me out of the blue, and asking for a favor at the first meeting?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for now, I had no choice but to put my faith in him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar…… I asked, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I suppose. After all, even with Kron present, tis not enough…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey hey!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis fine. Keep asking. This is within expectations. Continue asking, and the tide will turn.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But… uh…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Express yourself, gain his interest.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar, with a serious expression, told me to keep asking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fact that Tre’ainar, who has had a long relationship with this Dragon King, said so, must mean something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, we just have to believe in Tre’ainar and keep asking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th that’s right… I beg of you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please! You’re the only one we can rely on right now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s so annoying~. At least, I have no obligation to help with that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Vasalar grew a little bored and absent-minded, rather than unconcerned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if he’s sleepy after a meal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t go on like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to get him interested somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you … are you like a comrade of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m human, but believe it or not… I’m the last disciple of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar. And Kron here is the same as the Great Demon King Tre’ainar――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I mentioned being Tre’ainar’s disciple in front of Kron… I’ll get her to keep quiet on it afterwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, but at least now we can talk about it a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried to appeal to him with Tre’ainar’s name, but I got a different response than I had expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Isn’t he Tre’ainar’s familiar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, weren’t you close… Tre’ainar? What’s going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuwa~~ ah… that reminds me, th’ old days had such wee ones in vast numbers. My father is rich~, he’s great~, he’s a nobleman~ just prattling as such on and on, incompetents that can’t do anything else.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Times change. I’m not sure what happened, but even if a human is Tre’ainar’s disciple, that’s just th’ way of th’ era, and I don’t take them lightly just because they’re human. I know very well how spirited humans can get. I’m just saying…… laddie. What’s the point of being Tre’ainar’s disciple? What if he and th’ young lassie are similar? How trifling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I saw those eyes, my body got hot. How embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It sounded like he was saying that I was no different from those “idiot sons of nobles”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, maybe that’s actually what he just said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other party is the Dragon King of Hades, but I’m Tre’ainar’s disciple, so I thought he would listen to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked like a small fry to this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why he looked at me with such a bored expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is this all right? At my most passionate peak … everyone was expressing themselves, regardless of whether they were human or demon. I, Tre’ainar, Hakuki, Kaguya, and many other greats devoted ourselves to battle, putting our lives and th’ world on th’ line! I lived through such an age and now live a lazy life where my blood and soul wither and grow, why would I lend any help or interest to some immature wee bastard who can’t even talk to me without help from th’ dead Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legend of the Past… he felt like one of those who were always proud of things like “In those days we were…”, it’s no wonder I look like a small fry saying “I’m a disciple of the Great Demon King”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such is th’ circumstance, you oaf. If you’re going to ask for my help, do so when you can get my interest without help from anyone.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s… how it is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, is that so… I get it now… Tre’ainar…… you and this guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Such is the way it is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You knew, didn’t you? From the start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Dragon King of Hades was not someone who will listen to you if you ask him for a “favor”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So you’re saying… if I can get you interested, then it’s okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Quite so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… hnn?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Geez, this master! I’m up against the legendary Dragon King of Hades, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, you didn’t tell me to do this from the beginning… because you thought I’d be intimidated?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, I knew you would reach this answer soon enough.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do you get someone interested in you when they’ve spent all their life fighting?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s that simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, very difficult, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~… how nostalgic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, I should show you “my power”, right? Against the Dragon King of Hades.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Against such a monster that seemed to be stronger than anyone I’ve ever fought… stronger than Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if they wither away… those eyes have yet to rot, have they? See? Vasalar. His power is still immature, but… the child has enough to hold your interest, does he not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar believed, “I can do it”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the most reliable foundation in the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Vasalar, the Dragon King of Hades… once again…… allow me to introduce myself! I am―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t want it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to introduce myself to Vasalar again as me, without the title of being a disciple of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar attached to my head, but Vasalar interrupted me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s not just because he wasn’t interested in me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a man… give your name with your body and soul. Then, as an after meal dessert, I will take a look at your existence.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps he was interested in me for a moment, Vasalar smiled with a grin and slowly moved his gigantic body to confront me.
</div>
