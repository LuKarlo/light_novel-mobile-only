 “Nuwahahahahaha, been a while since I last played with a human… was it since Kaguya? Well, that one being classified as a human being was questionable… now then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar got up as if to lend his chest to me, saying, “Come at me,” as I activated the breakthrough and got into a fighting stance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the other side, it’s not a battle, he’s just trying to assess me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Unlike the time against Jamdi’el, there is no strategy. Think of nothing, just clash into him.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the battle against Jamdi’el, I was only thinking about winning anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that purpose, we made a strategy and played a lot of tricks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time it’s not a fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a kind of self-introduction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, there was no need to hold back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Magic Spiral】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hou~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An effective way to let people know who you are was by giving them your best from the start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A roaring spiral. A whirlwind blowing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And just as I was about to jump in, Vasalar squinted a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. After th’ breakthrough… it’s not just “knowing” it… but actually seeing it with your own eyes…… no, it’s as if you’ve experienced it, not just a mimicry… how nostalgic…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In those words, I muttered “correct answer” inwardly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, over and over again… is it even a dream? No, I’ve been shattered many times by this technique in a world where it’s a dream but it’s reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not just an imitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll prove it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Earth Spiral Break】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Attack, drill through! The legendary Dragon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No need to worry about anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pieeeeeeeeeeerce!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuunh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said, don’t think about anything, just hit it-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwahahahahahahaha…… such grit. Spirit is also good. However…… th’ power still has a long way to go, compared to him… a juggling act.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hard! That was the moment I jumped in and thrust the spiral, the feeling that was transmitted to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment my spiral touched the scales of Vasalar, it had a completely different feel and sensation than any other time I had used this technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it wasn’t just hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, r, rotation… but”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the rotation of the thrusting spiral has stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With his spiral, by its mere rotation, it creates a great maelstrom that kicks up th’ clouds and roars even in th’ heavens, literally causing a catastrophe.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s hard, thick, heavy, with high density, and it’s not the scales and skin hardness and flesh thickness and whatnot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean…I can only say “It’s different, it’s gargantuan”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This thing is so fundamentally different from any creature I’ve ever encountered that I can’t even begin to describe what makes it different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it was quite impressive. Now then…… I shall give my name.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With power… Gaeh―――――!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I thought Vasalar was going to let out a deep, sighing breath of air… but then my entire body was flung violently as if I had been charged by a rampaging horse, and I struck on the ground countless times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, tsu, gah!”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not about endurance or anything like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wee and light~ …… well, I could tell just by th’ sight of you. Now…… what will you do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a force so strong that human beings could never withstand it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An attack? Even though I wasn’t touched directly, it was engraved into my bones.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ts, gah… wh, what the… hell was…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using the breakthrough, my reaction speed has also improved, but it is as if my pride at having gotten a little stronger over the course of these intense battles had been shattered…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But you still live. Do not forget. Your task is not to defeat this one. He understands the difference in power between you. And has no intention to kill you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, just as the blow made me realize the difference in power, Tre’ainar told me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What Vasalar wants to see is beyond here. What would you do from here in this situation … there, Vasalar will attempt to gauge the essence of the person.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew from the beginning that I couldn’t win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I could have faced it the first time if I felt like it, as long as I was foolhardy enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re just a momentary idiot…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, pull yourself together, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte~… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, what if you could experience the power of the opponent and realize the difference is immeasurable?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, getting up again to fight is quite difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it sounded like Tre’ainar was saying, “I want to see if you can do it”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From here…… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That’s right.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if she could see through my thoughts, Vasalar nodded with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Foolishly enough, anyone can challenge th’ strong once or twice. But knowing fear, can you still throw yourself out again for something that you can’t give up on? Show me. There I shall see your nature.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s terrifying…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jeez… it’s exactly as you said…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Dragon King… is not as terrifying … as Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuh? What was that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said, this is the kind of guy Vasalar is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He saw through everything from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I wonder why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think about it like that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So strong and big… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar has fought with this guy and won.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I spar with that Tre’ainar every day, and he still believed in me and pushed my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I should be able to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “More than the fear of what’s in front of me… I’m more afraid of being a disappointment and abandoned.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not to the Dragon King… no. To Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “One more time… more than before… I’ll go through you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The difference in power was drilled into me, but somehow I was not afraid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Su~… hah~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I was able to calm down and get into position.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwahahahaha, you’re a cheeky wee laddie, skillful too. D’you also use Magical Breathing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Magic Spiral, Earth Spiral Break】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Perhaps, you may really be his disciple, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Take a breath, inhale the magic power, and dive back in with full force —
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th’ technique itself is th’ same. You can’t numb me with th’ same thing you already once showed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Blah blah blah, enough talk! Ruaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeehh!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With no result, I can’t give much praise to useless screaming.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even a little bit. I want to leave my mark on this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, just “thinking” does not bring immediate results.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As long as the power of the technique itself does not change, it may be natural … it’s not just about feelings… to get results, I need more power…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not delve into negative thoughts now. Think simpler.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『More power? I have given you the hint already, have I not? So you should be able to do it now.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you teaching me? What? More? How?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, be that as it may… what are you doing there? You have the same genes as I do…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The child denied it, but… if are unable to move anything in this place, you truly will be nothing but a doll, will you not? Well, so long as you play the role of summoning Vasalar… I do not care anymore…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was losing myself, so I didn’t know for certain, but it sounded like Tre’ainar was whispering something to Kron, who couldn’t see him or even hear his voice.
</div>
