<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Morning. The daily journey to the academy feels rather awkward today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because my muscle pain is just terrible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, my legs are heavy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. After all child, we never got to the forbidden spell lesson yesterday.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, after phantom sparring yesterday, I was exhausted and mentally drained, and I couldn’t do anything, so my special training with Tre’ainar only went that far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, today after school, in addition to the same regimen, magic training will be imposed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is also for the boobs. But before that, will I be able to manage the academy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why not just forgo it? Tis a waste of time. Seeing to your training all day would be more effective.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s what I’d like to do as well, but… The other day, I just skipped the afternoon class, so I’m sure Sadiz will be upset next time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I’d like to skip it too, but Sadiz would get angry and my father will be shocked if such a thing reaches his ears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Although, I might fall asleep in most of the classes… probably.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That will truly be a waste of time… As such, tis training in class.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? What can I do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are up to task. All you have to do is meditate quietly. That way, you can utilize your time effectively without distressing the class.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way! I didn’t think he’d bring a training session even during class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I’m almost always training except when I’m sleeping…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, practice with meditation… what? Are you deluded?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis image training. Are you making light of image training? Unlike with shadows, there is no need to move the body.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seems easy enough…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But, I have devised something excellent. There is magic that may prove more effective than image training. As soon as you arrive at the Academy, sign a Magical Contract.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Ah, I’m going to sign a contract at the Academy!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar showed a motivated expression after suddenly thinking up some good training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is he really going to train me in class?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How in the world…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what are you talking about in the morning… Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gah, that was close. Who asked me that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Princess… Phianse…… , Good Morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Good morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, I didn’t think the princess of the empire would be standing alone in the morning on the busy street of the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I guess the escort Knights are watching over from a distance, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going on? You always—“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… What’s going on? You usually go to the academy in a carriage…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the other party is a princess. Of course, every day they are sent to and fro in their carriages escorted by the Imperial Warriors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But today is not the case, walking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the princess showed me a glass of juice. It is fresh juice from a recently opened fruit shop in the capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My classmates recently said this juice was very delicious, so I was curious to try it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s why, don’t get the wrong idea, it’s not like I was waiting to ambush someone or anything, also we met here just by chance! We’re heading to the same destination and the classes anyway, so let’s go to school together!” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… I don’t mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um Um it looks like it’s. Unhun. There’s no reason to refuse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m still amazed she can talk so fast, but I understood that we would go to the academy together for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no reason to refuse, so when I agreed, the princess ran up and stood next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu… But this is the first time I’ve been to the Academy with you. We were in the same class for three years… By the way, I didn’t have to talk to the principal directly and force us into the same class for three years, so it’s really a coincidence.” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Phianse takes a carriage every day.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s true, too, but… you could pick me up in a carriage, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You should walk for your health… that’s what Sadiz says.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz is also a childhood friend of the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and His Majesty are best friends and companions from the time they were kids, and in the same ‘Seven Heroes’ party.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of that, this princess and I often met when we were little, and we used to play.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who was still small, was there to look after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Muh… Sadiz… Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, although they played together, they were not good friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Due to our fathers, the Princess and I were forced to play together with Sadiz looking over us. I don’t know why the princess has a bad relationship with Sadiz, but I was stuck in the middle of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’d rather be with Sadiz, so even if the princess said, ‘I’m going home now!’, I’d just going home and play with Sadiz… so, because it looked like I acted rudely towards the princess, I would end up eating a fist from father afterwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… then…… when you go home, you study and train with Sadiz… just the two of you… do you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, not as much lately… I just solve a collection of her math problems, and we eat our meals together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes. Well, it’s not something special… It isn’t, is it?” [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something special… I think I’m making progress.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that sense, for ‘now’ there has been no progress.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is only ‘now’ that is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It all depends on the outcome in two months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Hey, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… you…… the discussion about after graduation, have you heard anything from your father?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… From father? …… Not in particular…… I haven’t seen much of him lately.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Well then, the future… what do you think of it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Especially, until then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s this all of a sudden? She looks a little serious, it’s hard to say. Does the talk have anything to do with her unfortunate relation with Sadiz?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m thinking. Thinking about everything…… Trying to get it right. Graduation…… No, with the victory in our match, I will show our fathers, the people of Imperial Capital, and people from other countries. Everything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Victory…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Earth. I’ve fought with you many times, and I’ve been with you since I was little. Besides, you’re not as smart as I am, but you’re smart. So…… you’re my… you know what my feelings and wishes are!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’s feelings and wishes. I know that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This person continued to make efforts to be strict and superior to anyone else, even though she was royalty, and became recognized not only by the Academy but also by many people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s all for the big one, which I can’t even imagine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Somehow…… But.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? …… Oh I see…… you noticed after all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the Empire. For the world. For mankind. For the future. We will continue to protect the present peaceful world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps she continues to have such lofty feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve never lost to you… That’s why I won’t lose at the games. And when I win the championship… I get everything! Everything… That’s it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess made her declaration to me with a serious expression while her face blushes slightly as though she is a little embarrassed to state her goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made me feel her strong will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a real, unwavering will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared to that, the reason why I fight… If I win the championship, Sadiz’s Boobs… I can’t say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I utter such a shameless thing, I’ll very likely get beat up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still… That’s my motivation, so I can’t help it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not sure I’m thinking that deeply about the future compared to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I’m serious about this tournament, too. No, I’m going to take it seriously.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the time comes, I hope to look back at my father’s surprised face, and most of all, Sadiz’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also want to be cool in front of the woman I fell in love with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Boobs are a chance, and I might be able move to forward with the flow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More, be in a relationship that has progressed……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m the one who wins the championship!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a man… I’ll be cool. And I’ll get what I want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Get it. I’ll feel them, grab them, lick them, and pinch them, and… them all over myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not for the empire, it is not for the world, it is not for humanity, nor for the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… for me, it’s just for me, but… even so, I’m getting motivated, so I can’t help it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to win the championship!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have I ever said words like “to be at the top”, “win”, or “absolutely win”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a kid, I felt like I was screaming at things like that and working hard, but recently I thought I couldn’t beat the princess or my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But not now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also wanted to return the declaration of war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the princess began to be upset by my attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T-This is, is, is it that? That…… c-confession, th-that I wanted from the man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh?! This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-B-Because, it’s that sort of thing, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, have I been found out!? No, well, my feelings have been exposed since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tha-That’s right… you are yourself… But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the princess heard my proclamation, she doesn’t get angry or retort, but she seems to be upset about something. However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. But I’m the one who wins the championship. Otherwise, even if you get it… I can’t just lay on my rear, I mean, I can’t lead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, you want to win the championship and gain recognition and pull from everyone? But still, I won’t lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-That’s right… Yeah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She gradually calmed down, and on the contrary, the princess suddenly smiled at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A bright smile that I’ve never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, win or lose, no complaints. We’ll settle it in two months!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, no more words were needed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reasons are different from each other, but there is no choice but to fight and decide.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood it, too, and nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『She said that, didn’t she? Child…… you are intelligent, so you should understand the princess’s feelings.』 [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, who had been silent by my side, opened his mouth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I must say. This child is surprisingly naïve, he lacks the faculty to understand anything. And as such, the situation is likely to become so unscrupulous it will provide much hilarity. Tis interesting enough, hence I shall remain silent on the matter.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not sure… Is he trying to say I’m still immature?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar said nothing more, as Phianse and I went to the academy side by side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] (｡▽皿▽) The Tsun is strong with this one!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] (￢_￢) Is it? Is it really??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Fishing for a rival it seems. At least she’s aware of the competition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] He doesn’t! I’m keeping the ‘Dense Protagonist’ Tag!!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
