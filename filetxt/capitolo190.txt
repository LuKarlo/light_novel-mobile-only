<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To face such a big and strong person, despite his fear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I look at him, I am beyond terrified, and my heart throbs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what people say, I feel a will that will not yield.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… you are so brave, aren’t you? And with such a strong heart.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, what about my heart?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the time I could remember, I’ve been different from others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was said to be a goddess who drew the blood of god, and was blessed with a privileged environment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While my country and people lived in poverty under oppression, I was never inconvenienced, never starved, just acquiring the knowledge I was given, and sometimes went out in front of people to give smiles and words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Lady Kron, once thou turn fifteen, I will partner thee with the most promising disciple I have raised, to give birth to the next generation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had never thought of it as a misfortune.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I was taught that this is what I was meant to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I was young, I had some troubles, not to say I was unhappy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do I look different from others?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why don’t I have a father or a mother?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why was I born into this world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el, who had been with me since I was little, every time I asked…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Thou are different from those apes. The chosen being who draws the blood of God!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She would say, without hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I am not only for myself, but also for all the people in this world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Being a person who draws the blood of God, I was not allowed to have any selfishness whatsoever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe I didn’t have a will of my own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――I see… thou is… a pitiful doll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s why I couldn’t get those words out of my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I couldn’t deny them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I a doll?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s why I can’t get those words out of my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Don’t you call Kron a doll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth, you said that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, you asked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― What do you want me to do? No, what do you want to happen? What is it you want? Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You asked me what I wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is that? When I heard your words, that was my only answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, it reminded me of the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro. Why are you going outside?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was younger, the person who played with me also had his own will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Both you and the master came from outside this island, yeh. I also want to see what’s outside this island. There may be a place for me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is your country, right?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe so, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro touched his horn with a slightly lonely expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this country, Bro and I were the only ones with horns growing out of our heads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Bro seemed to be somewhat concerned about his horn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, I want to get stronger. The master… don’t chase after desires you don’t understand, she just wants me to look at you. Do you know how a man feels about that? Lil sis.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro is my brother, but I’m a goddess, so I don’t have a family.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkakka, then you do what you want, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, he stroked my hair, crumpling it up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was always getting angry at that, saying it was “disrespectful,” but I didn’t hate it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As I am now, I don’t have the power to have master see me as a man. That’s why I’m going to get stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stronger …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t want to spend my life regretting my weakness. If I’m strong, I could prevent things that could happen, I wouldn’t lose, and with that, I wouldn’t have any regrets, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so Bro ran out of the country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, he turned to me and said…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron, you too… you’re a good kid, but… let’s get stronger, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I couldn’t think too deeply about that remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I felt sad that the friend who played with me left the country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you know what, Bro? Now I remember, and your words came to my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I regretted that they took Jamdi’el away from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Earth brought out the feelings that I had kept in my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What did I regret?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What did I want all along?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What did I want to say…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― My true feelings… were full of what I really wanted to call her… there were so many… in the end, I couldn’t say anything!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My own true feelings, even if I am a doll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to my feelings, you said to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――I’ll fly you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And like this, you are still fighting to fulfill those words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Third time’s the chaaaaaarm, 【Great Magic Spiral】!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwahahahahahahaha…… nothing else?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If true, that was my role. That’s what I have to fight for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why you’re willing to go that far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’ve already got my answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro, you’re right. I need to be… stronger. And I need to do it now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I felt right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. I don’t want you to fly me there. I want to fly with you too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t wait for someone to help me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will fight too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also want to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With you, Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s my will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I’m sorry, Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, for the first time, I will go against your instructions and use the power of “this eye”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, please get very angry afterwards, okay?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
