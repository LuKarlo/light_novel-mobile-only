 More than now? How? Anyway, I screamed and unleashed the Great Demon Spiral with all my might, only to be bounced back by Vasalar and rolling on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar had the power to kill me at any time, but he handled me with just enough restraint to keep me from falling unconscious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, after my special attack was unleashed three times, he was getting bored of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the perspective of Vasalar, even my strongest technique was considered as me being “out of material”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I have no choice but to use the Great Magic Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Vasalar released a light breath at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Magic Spiral Earth Spiral Tornado】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I attacked with a tornado generated from the Great Magic Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsuo!? P, push through!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, even the strongest and most powerful vortex was blown away by a single breath from Vasalar’s nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this was reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar’s breath shook me and the axis of the vortex.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar snickered at me with his nose, “is that all?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… Oooooooooooooooh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said he had already given me a hint.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he said so, that means it’s true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What have I learned so far? When did Tre’ainar give a hint? Where? What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Creation(Genesis)!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I found Kron, who was supposed to have been behind me, right next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… That eye… Hohou!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the moment both her eyes were opened, they shone like the sun at dawn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Six-Gates? No, this dawn light is… Daybreak Eye(Gyokogan)!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I suppose you have yet to reach the Six-Gates… well…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Vasalar raised a surprised voice for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also looked on with interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron? What, are you… it’s dangerous―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you’re prepared, I’ve made up my mind in my own way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If this is a path that must be fought for, not just prayed for and hoped for, then I will go with you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, who always had an incomprehensible natural side to her, shouted this next to me with a strong tone and strong eyes for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Like Earth, many spirals, appear!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Kron shouted, they appeared without warning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A myriad of glowing spiral vortices about the size of my Great Magic Spiral appeared above Vasalar’s head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, idiot!? Kron, what the hell…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rain down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At Kron’s direction, the Great Magic Spirals fell all at once on Vasalar like rain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did Kron do all this? I don’t understand. What the hell is going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~, how unbearable, nuwahahahaha, oh, they keep coming~ dong dong“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar received the rain of spirals. His expression changed from his boredom, and he gave a very belligerent smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Rose! Please catch Vasalar!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the ground shook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, from under the ground, a huge plant with thorns appeared… that’s the magic that angel prince had used!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! Nuwahahaha, a pretty big flower!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Giant rose vines entwined around Vasalar’s entire body, tightening, and trying to capture and restrain his movement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why was Kron using such magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, this power… Jamdi’el told me not to use it carelessly. I disobeyed Jamdi’el’s instructions.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even as she unleashed great magic that restrained Basara’s movement, Kron held her tongue and was bashful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, she immediately opened her shining eyes…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So the reason I’m here now, fighting like this, is not because …… anyone told me to, it’s because I want to!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, show them!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same moment that Kron shouted, I heard a somewhat cheerfully murmur from Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t understand what she meant, and I was still puzzled by Kron suddenly standing next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nwahahahahaha, oh, ouch, it hurts… or so I’d like to say… you still don’t have much of an imagination.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An ‘illusion’ that hurts a wee bit, but your imagination is still not enough to reach me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though all those Great Magic Spirals have poured down all at once, and his whole body was caught with huge rose vines, it wasn’t effective on Vasalar at all?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This stuff, doesn’t woooooooork!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Incidentally, child, tis just an illusion.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar murmured, the spirals and rose vines that fell upon Vasalar were ephemerally shattered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But illusion? Vasalar seemed to see through it, but it looked real to me, you know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Simply put, tis like showing Fantasy Magic, 【Vier】, in the real world and involving others…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The ultimate illusion that affects the brains of all who see the dawn light. The illusion of the brain also affects the five senses. Not just sight, but …… pain and suffering as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An illusion of pain and… suffering?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. A light that illuminates the ambiguous world between night and morning… the power to control the boundary between the reality and fantasy of the world……… that is―――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eyes that Kron had. The name of the eye was one that I had heard of during class at the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was one of the magic eyes, along with the Heraldic eye of Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been so long since I’ve dealt with th’ Daybreak Eye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is the Daybreak Eye. Of course I’ve never seen it before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t strange, since the Heraldic eye exists, but Kron had such eyes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But after all, it’s a backward compatible version of th’ ‘Six-Gate Eye’ that Tre’ainar had attained. In addition, you have been raised with great care, haven’t you? Th’ imagination put into your creation don’t amount to much, do they? Also, th’ illusion of physical pain and suffering… I didn’t really feel much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyone with that eye can create any illusion that is close to reality. Whether it is a vision of th’ world’s collapse, hellfire, and divine lightning, all depending on their imagination. However, my existence is far beyond that imagination of yours.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised that Kron had such a legendary magic eye, but the opponent was also a legend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, it’s a monster that was once like a rival to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, who has little actual experience, can’t win suddenly against such an opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You may be right. I don’t know anything. Still, nothing. That’s why…… I want to learn more from now on. I want Jamdi’el to teach me. And Earth too. And the world. I want to know more about the good and the bad. But I don’t know yet. Then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Kron grabbed my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And looked at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, lend me your strength―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t ask me that now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t come all the way here only for me to say I won’t give it to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… yes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if Kron couldn’t win on her own, there are two of us now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I also took Kron’s hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With me and Kron…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What about it? You think a lad and wee lassie can face me by working together? Don’t underestimate me too much, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, it’s not an easy opponent to beat just because Kron and I joined forces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Kron whispered to me as if she had some secret plan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From now on, I will use the power of my eyes to apply an illusion on you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s… to make you believe, ‘you can do anything’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no, I’m not sure either…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t understand what she was saying. However, Kron herself didn’t really seem to understand when I asked her back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, Jamdi’el said… the power of my eyes seems to exert a strong suggestion on the other person’s brain, so not only can I show them illusions, but I can even recreate the pain and suffering that their brain believed… um, so… hmm, I mean! You’ll be able to do anything from now on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it doesn’t make any sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I did not have the option to refuse.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
