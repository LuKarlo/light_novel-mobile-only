 What Vasalar wanted to see was not our strength, let alone victory or defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that sense, this is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s fine. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Smiling with satisfaction, Vasalar acknowledged me and Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We dove in hot and hit our attack hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I wasn’t sure how powerful our attack was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, we were surrounded by a dazzling flash of light, and when I noticed, Kron and I were lying on their backs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if we were simply rebounded by Vasalar’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, we didn’t seem to have been evaluated as useless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gwahhahahahaha, you passed. I shall lend you some power, as thanks for numbing me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard those words, Kron and I both jerked our bodies up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, Vasalar, will you take us?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, Vasalar!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I said you passed. I’m not so cheap at th’ very least. So rest easy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The legendary Dragon King was laughing gaily, like a good-natured old man in the neighborhood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You did it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We did it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without thinking, Kron and I high-fived each other. Kron did this so naturally, even though I’m sure she had never done anything like this before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As he saw our resounding touch, Vasalar laughed again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouou, so immature~, so bittersweet~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, he really was just a neighborhood old man…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But now you want a contract with me, right? Er? Or with Kron, was it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Hmm~… yesh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s it, a contract.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was getting nervous as I said it myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because this is it, isn’t it? Until a while ago, I was facing the legendary Dragon King of Hades as an opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That legendary dragon will be my monster summon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was as excited as a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, it’s too late for me to get involved in th’ struggles of th’ world today…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To be honest, I’m quite content now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… eeeeeehh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? Are things starting to get a little weird?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, wa, waaaaaiitaminit!? Eeeh??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th’ Seraph tribe is th’ opponent… I enjoyed this, but with such dull opposition as that, how disappointing~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, he seemed to have had enough, or perhaps he was satisfied with the fun he already had and any more would be redundant, so he put on a very questionable expression, as if to say a battle with the seraphs would be boring and would ruin his current mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, we had an agreement.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know, calm down. That’s why I’m thinking. Uuuuunnn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s not changing the agreement. But, it’s such a pain. He seemed to be thinking that way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, at this point his whim could leave us stumped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Vasalar smiled as if something had flashed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yesh! There’s an adequate fellow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll have you make a contract with my son!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was an unexpected idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your, son?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you have a son, Vasalar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Nu…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think the Dragon King had a son. Well, it wouldn’t be strange if he did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar looked somewhat doubtful…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yesh. But, because I had withdrawn myself from th’ war between th’ Demon Realm and th’ Surface World, my son, regardless of that, was spoiled rotten as a result. Well, I think that being together with you will be a good stimulus for th’ lad and lead to growth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… but you’re going to sign a contract, right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwahahahahahaha, at first it was good, but…… if you think about it carefully, with me on your side, all your future battles will be easy, so you won’t be able to grow anymore now will you? As his disciple, if this is your goal, I don’t mind, but … it’s not, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar looks at me with a grin, as if testing me. It’s like his expression was saying, “You’re not that kind of a fool, are you?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he puts it like that, I want to say, “Of course” but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『His son… last I saw that one was, tis been many years… well, but for the time being, the bloodline of the Dragon King…… sure enough…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar seemed to be groaning a little bit about something… but still, a dragon is a dragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, an outrageous thoroughbred.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it’s not a bad idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, okay, then! So introduce us to your son, Vasalar! Of course, this is not the goal. With the help of your son, I’ll get closer to where you are!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Vasalar! Please introduce your son!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and I were not particularly opposed to Vasalar’s idea, so we agreed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right then, let’s summon him now! Oŷağamoń Ƥemoń Ƥeŝaiaķu… Bloodline Forced Summon, 【Ojaverka】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar’s huge body was filled with overflowing magic power, and he recited a chant that we have never heard before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing that, I started to look forward to it again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, even so… I’m going to be a dragon knight from today… the master of the dragon with the blood of the Dragon King… a Dragon Rider…… a Dragon Master…… if I’m going to have a title like that, I’ll have to think of a name for myself… Great Demon Dragon King Knight … or something like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A hero astride a dragon. It really tickles this man’s heart since childhood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m excited to think that I will be such a person from today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when Vasalar, who finished chanting the spell, slammed his arm to the ground…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unununununununu … nununununu, isn’t it quite … hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only half as big as Vasalar, but it’s still a huge body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, rather than gargantuan, it seems that there was a tremendous roundness of the body… What? A huge hippo?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something round with scales the same color as Vasalar… pulling, trembling, and crawling on all fours, it’s …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well!? What are you doing, pop!? I was just having a great time picking flowers! …… I’m at…… Where am I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Horrible, it’s somewhat bracing itself on the ground!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hippopotamus turned around, inflating its big nose, the eyes were weak and it looked very annoyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, a horrible scene!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what’s with this guy!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『More rounded and obese… than when I was alive…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the hippopotamus? At the sight, Tre’ainar was holding his head, looking stupefied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ts, no way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This fellow is my son, ‘Hilladon’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…!? Yoyoyoyo, your sooooooon! Thaaaaaat!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara~… he’s so cute!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been fantasizing about this since I was a kid. The sinister gigantic Dragon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing the existence of Vasalar, which was no different from that delusion, I thought that would also fit the legendary dragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What is it! Where are we? I mean, who are these people?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Th, this … this is … this is … that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The image of the dragon in my head has shattered to pieces…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is… the son of Vasalar. Dragon King of Hades…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this really Vasalar’s son?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought that, the hippopotamus that was crawling on all fours……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unh~, you called me out of th’ blue, but I’ve never met you before! Quit bothering me already! Well, I know what you’re going to say anyway!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone says it! They look at me and say, ‘Still, isn’t he th’ son of th’ Dragon King’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph, I’m just me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard that phrase, I wondered why … I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A hippopotamus with a very uncool appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dragon far from the dragon knight that a man once yearns for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard his words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… my bad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was bowing my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it? Unexpectedly, I thought that I might get along with this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
