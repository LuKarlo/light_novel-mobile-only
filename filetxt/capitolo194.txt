 The hippopotamus…… Hilladon was puzzled when I bowed my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How, admirable.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… the reverse of congeneric repugnance… birds of the same feather… huh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Vasalar and Tre’ainar grinned at my attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, it’s another new dragon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Oh……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron looked at a fat hippopotamus that didn’t look like a dragon and said so with eyes gleaming with pure joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing those words, Hilladon…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!? Who is this lady?! You’re too beautiful to be a girl!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m so glad! My name is Kron! How do you do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “G’day to you! My name is Hi…… Darkness Bahamut Grand Cross! Would you like to come for a walk in th’ air with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Is this a date invitation? Ufufufu, aren’t you aggressive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at Kron, he clearly changed his attitude and was blushing red, and then hitting on her as if he were trying to seduce her… tte
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s with that cool name? He said to call you Hilladon.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, listen here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I grabbed Hilladon’s shoulder to make him listen to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the moment he saw me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm! What’s with you, and such a scary face! I, I, I do something or what!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Calm down! You didn’t do anything, listen to me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gya, I’m sorry I’m against violence, I’m sorry for being cheeky!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be so scared of humans! You’re still t - a …… a man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It has nothing to do with men or women! Male and female should always be equal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without thinking, I was about to say, “You’re still the son of the Dragon King?” but I stopped myself for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know better than anyone how disgusting those words can be to someone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I thought, “I see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if the people of the Imperial City were saying that about me like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, pop, who th’ hell are these people!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwahahahahaha, these are people who were able to entertain me. So, Hilua, why don’t you go play with them?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What’s going on? Play? Do you mean a race, or …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hilladon, who doesn’t understand the situation he was summoned to, was restless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To this guy, I pointed to the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want you to take me and Kron to the top of that cloud.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Cloud? Oh~, that big one… what’s that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s a woman who was taken there and we’re trying to go save her, but we don’t have a way to get there, so we need your help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh~… Save? It sounds quite dangerous… no way… are you going to fight someone or something?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We will fight. In a way, a battle with the Seraph Tribe?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least it’s not for pleasure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah … I expect so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t lie there. So I told the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, such, aaaaaaah! N, no good! Th’ world should be peaceful! Fighting is no good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, sure enough, this guy trembled and refused with all his might.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Certainly, it seemed that Vasalar had spoiled him rotten.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, Hilua. Lend them your back and strength!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pop!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s an order. You will not be allowed to return until you have gone on a rampage.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without saying a word, Vasalar tried to force Hilladon to do as he said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing those words, Hilladon trembled and cried out with teary eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you talking about, pop! That’s terrible! I’m not like you, pop! I have my own life! Just because I’m th’ son of th’ Dragon King doesn’t mean I like fighting!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can understand how he feels… Strangely enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was his father’s child he was different from his father. Yes, I get that feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Your life? Oh, Hilua. Have you achieved much by yourself to say that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You eat, sleep, and sh*t lazily every day… just eat, sleep, sh*t, lazily, everyday… is that th’ life you want to protect, even to disobey me, your father, Hilua?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… that’s … because…… laziness is th’ best evidence of peace… even you are lazily messing around too, pop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So. I’m fine with it, because I’ve been through so much and arrived at this point.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m fine with that too! Unlike pop, I took shortcuts to get to where I am now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I get it. Somehow, when my father tries to force me to do something, I get really pissed off and want to rebel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, Mr. Hilladon, can’t you help?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuhe?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My…… there’s a loved one of mine up there… it may be a bother or even dangerous for you… but… at least to take us to the top of the clouds…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at such times, when a beautiful woman touches you and asks you to do something like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, lady…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, do, don’t you feel anything about touching me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yesh, because I’m… th’ female dragons say I’m fat and not cool… everyone wonders if I’m still th’ son of the Dragon King…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not cool? Aren’t you really cute?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even more so, if you were told that you were cute while your head was being patted…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Forget th’ clouds! I’ll carry you to th’ other side of th’ heavens!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is what happens!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understaaaaaand, I get, you, I understaaaaaand!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahhh, what’s wrong with you, big guy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From today, we’re partners!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeeeeh, don’t want that? Why? I just want to help th’ lady, it’s has nothing to do with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, when you have a parent who’s too good, you’ll suffer from such a parent and their ego!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I’m really weak against women… that’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Laddie?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I couldn’t help but put my arm around Hilladon’s neck and burst into tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At any rate… we now have a means to act upon, but… well…… will this one be useful as battle potential?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar still had a somewhat doubtful expression, but still we’re ready to fly above the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that I had talked about 47 Ronin yesterday, but I suddenly decided to go to Edo this weekend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t make you raid, but if I don’t post tomorrow, forgive me.
