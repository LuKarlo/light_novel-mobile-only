 With Kron and I away, everyone was waiting for us to return, worried about us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They’re back!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older Brother! Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inya, thank goodness! We were worried ab… out … ueh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little m… heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and I returned to the ruined town while making a rumbling sound.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, everyone seemed to smile with relief, but the next moment, everyone’s smile froze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “E, erm…… what is that? That thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Ooouuuuh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wh, wha, what did you do? Th, at …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Something… amazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s only natural that everyone’s eyes are on this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Kron and I on his back, the colossus walked on four legs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold oooooooo. Wh, wh, wh, what the heck?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, h, h, huge!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, is that… a monster?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been a while since I’ve looked up at someone…… bigger than me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the contestants and the mighty men of the dojo are stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Including Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder. For those who have always resided in this isolated country, this is probably the first time they have ever encountered such a large creature.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I, who had been living in the Imperial City, have never seen anything like it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm … somehow … being watched, it’s embarrassing, Kro!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, that’s right~, everyone is surprised to see you, Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m kind of shy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps anxious about the gazes around him, Hilua mumbled shyly with such a big figure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Incidentally, Kron, who was already acting very familiar, has become friends with him, even calling each other “Kro” and “Hilly”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing, so big!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While everyone was overwhelmed by Hilua, Amae ran up to him with her eyes shining first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess, who is this? Unfu~ cuddle~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiya, hiya~, w, wh, who is, this child… sh, she’s so cute~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no fear at all, and Amae jumped at Hilua’s face, which was at a lower position due to walking on four legs, and rubbed her cheek against his.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, Amae, this one is Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hilly?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, he’s a reliable companion who will take us to the top of that cloud!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tsukshi and the others were startled at those words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Goddess, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! Riding on Hilly, Earth and I can go all the way to the clouds and save Jamdi’el!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, eeeeeeeeeh! Th, th, that!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike Amae, the situation wasn’t immediately accepted and the people around him remained confused, but with that one word from Kron, everyone’s expression changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, Hilly? Is your name Hilly? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yesh, that’s right. What’s your name?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amae is called Amae. Nfu~, Hilly, squishy~ “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiya~, Amae is also squishy! For th’ first time in my life, I’m glad I’m squishy! I mean, th’ girls on th’ Surface are so kind! I’m going to live on th’ Surface world from now on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following Kron, this reaction to Amae. I guess he’s had bad luck with women, or rather females, his whole life, even though he had been panicking until just a while ago, he even declared that he would live on the Surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, this guy is just…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Little man… what is this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who had a subtle expression when she saw Hilua, asked me. Well, this is a normal reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a bit of summoning magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that a winged hippopotamus?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A winged hippopotamus, and an amusing comrade.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t say, “Hilua is the son of the Dragon King of Hades”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that I’m keeping it a secret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I thought that title was unnecessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it summoning magic… and so big…… but will it be okay? It seems to understand human language… it’s big, but…… doesn’t seem very strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine. I asked him to take us to the top of that cloud that we alone can’t reach. From there, it’s our job to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’ll take us to the top of that cloud. That’s enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without him, none of our fists, spirals, or magic would reach that cloud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But thanks to this guy joining us, our power can reach it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, on this creature, Earth and the Goddess are going to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s the plan.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Assuming that Hilua is good for the time being, what should we do from now on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eyebrows of Mr. Machio and the others wavered at Kron’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, we don’t really know who Jamdi’el, our High Priestess, actually was, or those who came from above that cloud. And most of all, I’ve been called Goddess, but I wonder who I really am.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess this was Kron’s way of showing concern.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, Kron and Jamdi’el had been treated as a High Priestess and Goddess by the people of this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, after the arrival of the Seraph tribe, they had no idea what their true identity was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s concern was to keep everyone from getting involved in such an unknown background.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me? I’m fine with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But everyone else is different. Kron even wondered if she might have been deceiving everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why she was saying this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I think…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe for the people of this country, it’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Why so reserved? I decide for myself what to believe!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah! I knew they would say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron seemed to have been taken aback by the words uttered without hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio told Kron on their behalf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess…… no, Lady Kron. You’re mistaken on only one thing.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The High Priestess, our master,,,. we’re not fighting because we think that it’s our duty to help her.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter what your background, that existence saved us and made us strong. Some may have been sacrificed by the High Priestess’ underhanded intentions… like the young man called José and people of the old regime… so, not all of them, but… at least the men here don’t fight because they have to help. We fight because ‘we want to help’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. Even if Jamdi’el’s past was a great sinner, who the Seraph tribe and the human race of the world find unpardonable, still to the people of this country…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Machio? What do you mean by men? Don’t you think that’s sexist?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! At least there are women here who feel the same way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi, Karui and Amae are the same. The church sisters too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, everyone’s mind was already made up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone … will you all … fight with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pated Kron’s back lightly at her confused mutter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not right, Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Will you fight with me? No. Mr. Machio said it, didn’t he? Everyone will because they want to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, what you should say in a situation like this is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Kron understood the meaning of my words and firmly thrust up her little fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone! Let’s fight together!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Uoooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman called a Goddess, and also called a doll by the enemy, finally decided to lead everyone by her own will and fight with everyone side by side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do my best to support her back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naaaaaaaaaaah, I don’t know what’s going on, but I’ll do my best too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, I’m counting on you, my new comrade, Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ou, give us a lift!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s do it, Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll treat you to a drink next time, Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now we, who had been left unattended, began our counterattack against Heaven.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
