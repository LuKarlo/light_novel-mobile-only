<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve got the means to fly. All that’s left is to get on board once we’re done preparing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the biggest fishing boat in town. It can hold dozens of people!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This country is isolated from the rest of the world, but it is possible to go out to the sea, as long as there is access to the coast. That’s why they eat fish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, they have sufficient boats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, to get to the top of the cloud, we need a big fishing boat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You see? The nets and ropes will hold things firmly in place! Hilly, can you hold it properly?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? It’s a wee bit heavy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s guts! Guts!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By attaching ropes to the fishing boat and having Hilua carry it like a backpack, anyone who wanted to join us, except me and Kron, could get on board to participate in the battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi…… you guys…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio, of course I’m going too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And me! That’s why you’re staying here, Amae.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh~…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We can’t be too careful! Remember that prince or whatever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll smash that ass!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’ll show you how the range in my crotch is like the mountain and the ground!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s strike hard and fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, we’ll see what happens… either way, it’s going to be tough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The participants were mainly tournament contestants, with Elder Sis Tsukshi and Karui also riding along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I’m worried that all the very skilled people will come along…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mortriage. While we’re gone, you’re in charge, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, we’ll take care of it. So, Earth, go raise some hell!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa! Leave the reconstruction to us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to work too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Be careful.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I decided to leave it to these guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I wanted to leave the caretaker role to “her”, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you sure? Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Regardless of the past, I owe her for the food, clothing, and shelter she provided me in the past three months. So…… I’ll join you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, Sadiz was going to return to the Imperial City and report this to father and mother, but in the end she chose to raid with us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although Sadiz once lost everything to the Demon King army, she intends to fulfill the minimum obligation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If only a little, I want to be helpful to Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… I’ve already graduated from…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still, for me, I will always love Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it’s for me. She’s as sweet on me as ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as long as we still don’t know how strong the opponent is, it’s reliable to have her come with us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ms. Sadiz! Take care of this too, please! I’ve brought all the swords, spears, and crossbows I can find! As a martial artist, I don’t really want to use these sorts of things. I also brought some barbells!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you for your hard work. However, as long as the number of opponents is unknown, let’s bring as many things as we can use. I will store them into my extra space, so it’s okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please take my weapons as well, aye. Weaponry is my specialty aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with the magic of Sadiz, it’s easy to carry any luggage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In case something happens, we should take as many usable weapons as we can, so everyone brought their weapons to Sadiz with a DonDon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The preparations are done.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Older brother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Amae …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, it was time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Amae had to stay behind for this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She clung to my leg with a sad expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Uh… Gusu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though other sisters were there, the ones she was closest to, Elder sis Tsukshi, Karui, Kron and Mr. Machio were all going with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not surprising that Amae, who was left behind, would be heartbroken and on the verge of tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goforit… fighton…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No. It’s different. Amae clung to me once, but quickly pulled away…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Youcandoit, Older brother, big sisters, uncle! Everyone! You Can Do It Fiiiiight Ooooon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She gave me a shout, not words of selfishness or anxiety.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You too, Hilly! Fight on! Do your best, fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And everyone in the town who saw Amae also raised their voices all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, good luck, guys! Hang in there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Knock down the ones who did this to our town!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please save the High Priestess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, take them all doooooooown!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoooooooh, goooooooooo! Arcane True Zenith Huzaaaaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong cheers that made me shiver.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, we’re already fired up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As proof, we all had the same smile, regardless of man, woman or race.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you think? Kron?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… so passionate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s giving me strength.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not only are we fighting together, but …… we’re fighting for each other, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, who was an innocent girl, looked thrilled about something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed quite effective.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh~~~~, Tyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron thrust her fist up and raised the loudest voice in her own way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess…… uuuuuuuuuh, let’s go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ousha, I’ll do it too! Watch me, Amae!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I’ll do the same…… funyaraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, the rare war-cry of Machio… kuh, uoooooooooohh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh, me toooooooooooooooooooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, everybody… followed her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, everything was ready.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, Kron. The timing to strengthen everyone with the magic of the Daybreak eye…… I’ll tell you when.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’ll leave it to Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Leave it to me. Just like a ‘god’, I’ll indicate the best possible timing. And to everyone else, too! I may be cocky, but I’ll give some instructions to everyone! So listen up, will you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””I will follow the strongest man in this country, the tournament champion!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I’m counting on you, okay? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Entrust this to me. Huhahahaha, I feel like the commander of a single corps, although they lack the numbers to be an army, Fuhahahaha.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Troublesome?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, tis troublesome. As such, let us end it promptly, shall we? Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, what a devilish smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is truly the Great Demon King. This is also reliable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, in the fight against Jamdi’el, he defeated her in a two-on-one match by directing my actions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, Tre’ainar will be like a strategist, giving orders through me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, everyone, we are already prepared! I hope you’re ready too!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We will, by our own will, take back what is precious to us! God will bless us in our resolve!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m sure your God is here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After all?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Such nuisance.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was the Demon King, he seemed unaccustomed to being treated as a god.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed at Tre’ainar and heard Kron’s order.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, that heaven… erm…… what was it… raid? That’s it! Let’s go for it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They cried out in unison, with enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Hilly! Please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naah~, just hang oooooooooon! Fugu, Fubununun, nugu, unuunooooooooooooooon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His face turned so red that his blood vessels floated out, and his whole body, which was once so pudgy, condensed with power as he carried the fishing boat we rode on…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” I’ll do iiiiiiiiiiiiit, let’s goooooooooo!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s Hilua’s willpower. His guts. With the great physical power of the fire field, Hirua flew us on his back with great spirit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, thank you very much for your continuous support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have a report today, and I will write it here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think I’ve previously reported to you that I had a child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a continuation about the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, the cover of the child in the womb who has not yet been born… I was able to see his face, and I was grinning like an idiot parent, but I was told a new shocking fact…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It turned out that the child will be born as a “twin”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not yet decided when the child will be born in this world, but it seems to be certain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is my first experience and I am quite puzzled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, the responsibility as a parent is also doubled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it really all right for me like this? Isn’t there any pitfall?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, I haven’t been able to properly do my body painting due to pressure, so it is difficult to go outside every day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I thought that I could not be worried forever, so I decided to report on that today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first child born is “Novelization”. I would like to name the child who is born after a little time “Comicalization” and do my best to become a splendid parent in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both parent and children look forward to your continued support, thank you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, if nothing happens, the cover of the child who will be born soon this weekend…… I’m going to show you their face! The hot face of the master and disciple!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just letting you know I recently translated a short story written by the Author of this work. A little hilarious tale which also features a ghost. Have a read and comment please…
