 I’ve done “battle” before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Simulated battle at the academy. The Graduation Commemorative match. Ninja warriors. Shinobu. Mr. Aka. Toulowe. Bro. And the tournament during this time. Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this was my first group vs. group battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not to the scale which can be called war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, if we’re challenging the Kingdom of the Heavens, can we call it a war in a sense?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As we approached the sky, I began to feel a strange sense of tension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Savor that tension while you can. However, control your emotions so as not to lose sight of yourself in the excitement of battle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, you should feel this tension for now. But control your emotions so that you don’t lose yourself in the excitement of battle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oooh, that sounds like great advice!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, that right now was just for you, not everyone.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I was talking just to you right now, not to everyone…… eh? What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Huh?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so nervous that I just gave Tre’ainar’s advice as an instruction to everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, am I feeling excited or uneasy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, what’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I have to watch myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, don’t get too excited… it’s quite difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For the time being, child. Tis a situation where battle could break out at any time. Inform everyone about the formation of 3 man parties.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh, that’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although Tre’ainar will take care of the strategy and command, if something happens to me and my voice does not reach everyone, the command will be lost at that point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s a lot of pressure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In the meantime, I want you all to form groups of three for now. Don’t fight on your own, but fight together to watch each other’s backs.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I’ll tell them the basic battle formation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar says it is simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s protect each other’s backs… I see. Tsukshi, Karui”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, me, Machio and Karui are a set?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t rush out alone, cover each other?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gotcha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Danchok!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cooperation… I’d rather fight fair and square, one-on-one…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That kind of talk is no good. I’ll use any foul play, any move. Oh, team up with me. I’ll teach you that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be clear, we are not a trained army, so we cannot do complex coordinated attacks and formations, that’s why I’ll give the bare minimum of rules.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the basic three-man cell, also called the three arrows. If one person does not jump out suddenly, and three people cover each other, the party won’t be beaten so easily. And when attacking, all three should attack at once, like a storm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Um! Actually, this coordinated attack was unsuccessfully attempted by Bro’s prefects in the city of Cantidan. An integrated technique where three people attack like a storm. Tis called the Great Demon―――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oh, no way, the legendary trinity technique of the Arcane True Zenith… 【Arcane True Zenith Jet Stream】!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone accepted Tre’ainar’s instructions through me easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I’m grateful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At any rate, I didn’t want everyone to just go off on their own and destroy themselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if it’s a party of three, then me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, and Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’m on the same team as Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll be with Kron, and Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It will not be a three-man cell, but I’m left over, so I want to be added to your group, aye, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, there was a man who wanted to be with us because he was an extra after the three person groups were assembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wacha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, Sadiz is carrying my weapons, so I’d appreciate it if I was nearby, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha called out as if saying “Let me join you”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s not a problem, he’s a good fighter, and since Kron is one of the keys in this battle, there’s a way to fight and protect Kron by surrounding her with me, Sadiz, and Wacha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he was thinking about a different agenda, it doesn’t seem like he’s lying about trying to save Jamdi’el right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s up, aye? Don’t you trust me, aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha, who seems to have guessed what I was thinking, asked with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha himself seems to be aware that “I thought that there was an agenda”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, by suggesting this to me, on the contrary, is he showing that he has nothing to hide right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Worry not, child, join up.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As you anticipated, so long as Kron, who lacks high combat ability other than her magic eye, is present, you and the maid will have to fight while protecting her, but if he joins with you, the burden will be lessened somewhat.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… That’s right, but…… is it okay?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rest assured. Certainly, the man has his own circumstances. However, he will not betray you until Jamdi’el is saved. Otherwise, he would not come this far.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, Tre’ainar was saying that, and it will be alright.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, fine. I trust you for now. As a comrade I’ve traded blows with.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahaha, I want to learn how to be so open-minded at such a young age”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well! It’s encouraging to have Wacha with us! Thank you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well…… if Little man says so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, I trusted Wacha “for now” and firmly bumped his fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha smiled and took out weapons from the back and sleeves of his clothes as if to say he was ready for battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, the battle to rescue the High Priestess… it may be unscrupulous of me, but I’m excited about the situation where I can show off my skills to the fullest, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? What are you talking about? Didn’t you put out your skills to the fullest in our fight?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, with my bare hands… that is”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha took out weapons while saying something with implications.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were all unusual and unfamiliar weapons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also looking at them with a kind of admiration. That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are all these weapons?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? This aye? Three-section staff… tonfa… iron fan… nunchucks, sais, poison chain studs… shuriken…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, how many weapons do you have hidden? I’ve never seen it before.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, there’s still a lot more aye, Sadiz is holding all the weapons that were in my home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha talked to me with confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s livelier than he was at the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if saying his true specialty is “weaponry, not bare hands”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before confirming that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nooooooh, hey, s, something comes from behind th’ clouds!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hilua screamed in a panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we heard that voice, we looked up, and as we did the other day, armed valkyries with white wings flapping from the other side of the clouds appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was suddenly fussed about wacha and tension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right away, they come out in the open! This time, we’re not going to just take your attacks!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I clenched my fist, and my fighting spirit flared up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fuhahahahaha, you’ve let your guard down! The ban on the appearance of my children has been lifted!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
