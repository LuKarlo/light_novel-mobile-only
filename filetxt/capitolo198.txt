<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so bright. Morning has come already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I raise myself up from the bed feeling a slight chill, and looking next to me, breathing in her sleep, is a little bird that I took good care of last night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is thou tired? Thy sleep is deep. I’d like to continue taking care of her in the morning, but with my position, that cannot happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, I’m going to have another morning training session with those cute girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few days ago, we fell short in our first campaign due to Daddy’s interruption.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Most certainly, we were to fly around to the surface in a dignified and beautiful manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that would not be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The great sinner, Jamdi’el, surrendered of his own volition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though we charged the surface in high spirits, there was not so much a battle, just a little skirmish … also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The scar on my cheek is gone…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just had a little altercation with that sharp-eyed little boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nay, nary did we even fight each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that lad, by that little altercation, left a wound on my cheek.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, despite my Heraldic eye, there exists someone on the surface who could do such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, Jamdi’el quietly surrendered as she herself was already exhausted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That boy drove her to such a state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if I were to fight against him at his best?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel a ting of fear, yet at the same time my body is hot and aching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Never in my life have I felt such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what it is… this feeling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, well, this cute little bird… should still remain in bed. Thy chirps were quite loud yesterday.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dressed up, I softly left the chamber so the little bird may remain in slumber.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Prince… Good morning.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slightly grumpy with pouting faces, my cute little birds await me already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, is something wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Not especially…… the prince is exhausting himself every night.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… ahaha. I also find that pouty expression cute. Could it be jealousy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hau~, prince…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day after I take in a little bird, everyone ends up like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But with a little smile, they quickly turn red and distraught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh my, they’re just so adorable…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, to training we go. Things did not end well a few days ago, but we know not when all-out war with the surface will begin.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, peaceful times are not indefinite.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the will of the newly enthroned king of the Heavenly Kingdom, we, the Seraph tribe, shall go forth to capture the hegemony of the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 War. An unknown that our generation has only heard of in tales.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In all honesty, I would have been happy to spend every day peacefully, playing with my birds, but I also wanted a place where I could show the strength I have trained and nurtured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 War evokes in me a feeling of half tension and half joy, and everyone, including myself, is full of enthusiasm these days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s all because of “that man”…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince, before we train, there is a request to talk to Jamdi’el… from ‘that man’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “His Majesty will allow it, should the prince accompany him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that so? I see. Summon him then. I shall go to the dungeon as well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I met “that man” a few years ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He brought everything to our world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Prince! Please be careful. Jamdi’el’s hands and feet are bound, and her eyes sealed, but we know not what she might do. In earnest…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And that man as well, I… I don’t really know much of him…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, certainly he’s entertaining, but he can’t be trusted. So thou need not worry about me, okay? I won’t bring sorrow to thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hau~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Long ago, the Heavenly Realm suffered great damage by the betrayal of Jamdi’el and quietly watched the conflicts of the Surface World without interfering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We, the apostles of God, refused to get involved in the trivial conflicts of the unholy surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, we were asserted as, “frightened and withdrawn”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And his words and existence eventually brought a great change to this country, this world, and the Seraph tribe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, even he is hopeful for a full-scale confrontation with the surface…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu…… I feel like I’m dancing on the palm of his hand … at any rate…… the end of Jamdi’el’s execution is the beginning of everything. And with my achievements in the war… Daddy should acknowledge me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that is what I desire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if loved by tens of thousands of little birds… discourteous it may, they’re all but mere diversions… I want approval… from only one person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That hasn’t changed since the days of my childhood―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is it set, the day of my execution?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A voice sounded from beyond the darkness as we marched along the dark gallery leading to the dungeon cells.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suddenly felt goose bumps all over my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sweat on my back? Also on my hands? Just for the moment, did I get pressured?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This presence… is that the prince?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She is confined to a cell where magick is sealed by applying multiple magick formulas, both hands and feet are tightly bound, and both eyes are also blindfolded so that they cannot be seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though she’s literally helpless to do anything, by just hearing her voice…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, nay, just to check on thee… and someone here wishes to see thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feign composure to keep her from perceiving my agitation, how pathetic, of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, Jamdi’el has recovered both magick power and physical strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if, by some happenstance, she leaves this dungeon?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was unaware a few days ago, but looking at her in such a recovered state, I now understand much more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She is powerful…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, art thou keeping to thy promise?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Promise?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About Lady Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, she also has a weakness… surprisingly, there is something she would protect even at the cost of her own life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, she is not in this dungeon due to our ability.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I merely made an arrangement with her as she was exhausted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fear not. I haven’t touched the island country since then.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, it matters not. Why not just put me to death?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, wait, a personage of thy caliber. There is quite a bit of formality involved.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph, at most thou art preparing a stunt for ‘Dekte’ita’ to display his power, I suppose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Jamdi’el is sneering at Daddy. I heard that they are of the same generation, but … could there be something else?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, do tell thy father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou may wage thy selfish war, but… thou will never lay claim to the Surface World or the Demon Realm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not so naïve. Hence why I’ve been in hiding for the last 15 years, until I was ready.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The unexpected words from Jamdi’el, said with such a presence and power, left me astonished.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… thou mean those so-called Heroes of the surface… or the remnants of the Demon King’s army?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… It’s vexing, but… at the least ‘Hero Hiro’ is stronger than I. ‘La’iphant’ will not stand for it either…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So execute me, and raise the morale of the Seraph tribe by the rapture of having eliminated the stain on their history… but that will be thy peak.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou comprehend nothing. Thou ignorant wretches who forever only revere phantom gods such as Odin, the world will never yield to thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… If so, Tre’ainar, who died 15 years ago, is God… thou mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Inadvertently, I pulled away slightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wretch, thou dare…… to so frivolously utter his name.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pulled away just by the words of Jamdi’el, who was in a situation where she could not do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no… getting swallowed―――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, I give I give. We had a fun party yesterday~, I’m late cuz of a hangover.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When I woke up, my head ached, my stomach hurt, and I fought a battle in the lavatory… and whoa~, was that a fight. Hihahaha”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiya, prince. G’mornin. Sorry sorry I’m late~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He appeared, and in an instant, shattered into pieces terrible air that I was about to be swallowed up by.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, you can’t go bullying the youngins like that~? Ain’t he your junior? Right? Sis Jamdi’el~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wh… eh? Wha, ha? Wh, what is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha! Sis Jamdi’el, all tied up~ so incredibly precious. Cuz usually, she would the one to tie em up with a rope and strike em with a whip~, this gap is in・tri・guing~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… ri… ridiculous… ridiculous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, it’s been too long”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el, whom I’ve been overwhelmed by, as if beneath him… nay, as if in mockery, the man emerged with a smirk on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the presence, Jamdi’el’s state was clearly abnormal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th…… thou. It can’t be…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, even blind you can tell? You know it’s me? Naturally, you’ve known me for a long time, right? It’s been, what, 18 years?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “End… thy jest… by just thy voice? Even if I can’t see thy figure, or hear thy voice… just by this unseemly air… thou… still live?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For Jamdi’el, he was apparently unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had heard about their relationship before. Even so, it’s unlike Jamdi’el to get so upset… after all, he…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Priiiince! How dreadful, Prince! Quickly, please come …… right away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so surprised. All of a sudden, my subordinate’s daughter rushed in with a loud yell… what the hell is going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “F, from the surface… a huge, ugly creature approaches this country, carrying surface people with it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This also was a totally unexpected event for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, above all, the history of this world will change drastically today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s December, and the year is almost over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although I didn’t report last time, the overall evaluation actually exceeded 110,000 drills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 890,000 drills remaining. It’s getting closer and closer little by little. Thanks to everyone. Thank you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will keep working hard!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, in two weeks, the master and disciple will finally be lined up in the bookstore, and by the way, other characters also have pictures of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone’s favorite Fu Meday. Rebal. And Sadiz! Ph…… Phi… the Princess! And both his father and mother have a wonderful picture! The illustrations are also amazing. A picture of a Master and Disciple who are friends… maybe that special move…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
