 The Imperial Warrior Academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Three years had already passed since I entered the academy, and the results for end-of year written exam were posted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My name is easy to spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - 1st place: Phianse Depaltia, [1] 2nd place: Earth Lagann
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s the second from the front. So it’s easy to find.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the past three years, my grades have always fallen within the top 10, so it’s no surprise to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I have never been in first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it wasn’t just the written tests but in practical exams as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooooooooh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naive… I see through everything you do, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My abilities are better than that of most people. However, it’s not as big a margin as anyone’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thunder Spell 【Kilo Thunder!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The power of the spell is much better than last week. You seem to have put a lot of effort in a short period of time, but… it’s within my expectations.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I realized that there was a real genius in my vicinity who far surpassed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A genius I can’t beat, even if I studied enough to break my pen or swung my weapon around till I’m out of breath.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See, you’re about to lose your footing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, whoa, damn, whoa, who aarrrgh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With this… it’s my win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, I faced her head on, but ended up down on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mock battle over. Winner, Phianse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I lay on my back on the ground, I look up to the sky again right as the cheers started.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooh, it’s great. An overwhelming victory for Princess Phianse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Three years and still undefeated… will the streak stand until graduation?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Phianse… so lovely.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Beautiful and Intelligent as well… truly she is a child prodigy in whose body flows the blood of His Majesty, Emperor Solja, who was said to be the strongest spearman of the Seven Heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. Earth is not weak, but he hasn’t beaten Phianse once.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Outdoor on the exercise field! I sighed to the sound of my classmates in the open air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I’m only hearing the same comments as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you alright, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “NNngh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your magic power and sword skills have improved in such a short time. I recognize the effort. But you have yet to master it as a 【Magic Sword】 art.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it sounded like something said by the winner looking down on the loser, even though it is usually taken as praise for a worthy opponent after a good match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As you are now, won’t you be a disappointment to your father, the hero. Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I lack, the dignity, princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman with beautiful long golden hair that has a slight roll. With dignified expression and eyes, and pure white hands and feet that seem to have never touched dirt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She has a tall and slender figure. Yet so curvaceous you could feel her motherhood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She is dressed in white short-sleeves and half-pants like everyone else, but her divine aura and presence make her feel different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, at the academy we’re all equal. We are even childhood friends. Call me Phianse. No honorifics, it’s a nuisance!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”Ha, yeah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And thus the scolding commences. However, even if she says to treat her normally, it is impossible. Because, this person is the princess of this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s shameful. I never thought you’d be unable to win even once. With this, won’t the next champion in the [Graduation Commemorative Match] be me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha ha ha, I guess ”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that funny? When you graduate, you will be a fine warrior, serve the Royal Palace, and will be a key figure in the protection the Imperial Capital beside your father. It would be a pitiful thing that you are weaker than me, the princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many times have I heard this sermon?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the other party wasn’t a princess, I would scream, [SHUT THE F!@# UP WOMAN]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If she wasn’t a childhood friend, I might have hit her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As the son of the hero who saved the world, isn’t it embarrassing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition to me, this school has children of nobles and other offspring of the heroes who defeated the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, none could beat Princess Phianse, either in academic or in combat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yet I’m the only one she preaches to every time. It’s quite annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s not just the sermons that get to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… the princess is a really impressive, but…… Earth is pretty strong, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, he’s a little withdrawn, but looks a bit wild and cool.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “His household is wealthy, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here they come! The girls in my class are blushing and praising me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This makes me happy and embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t beat the Princess, but I’m second place in my grade, so I’m an honor student.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, because my family is good, the girls usually don’t care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, you there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m done! The princess approaches the girls who were in the spectator seat by fast walking, and the face is put out with a jerk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There seems to be a little misunderstanding. Certainly, he is talented, his face may not be bad, and he comes from a wealthy family. But, he also has a twisted side too. His character is considerably demonic, and tends to be disobedient at times. Also, more than anything, when I was a child, he rudely peeked at my underwear, and he still hides smutty books in his room. The other day, I heard from his maid that he had hidden a double-bottomed drawer and even set up a magic trap to hide them. No, that isn’t good for the boys of his age, but he’s hiding something obscene. His appearance itself isn’t bad, but the eyes are pretty bad, no, I don’t think it’s wild and masculine, it’s just bad. His family is also wealthy, and his parents are two respectable heroes. However, his upbringing is too lenient, and he was spoiled growing up. You don’t want that, do you? No, but it’s not that he’s not working hard. He studies and trains very hard just so he can beat me. While he seems to not care about losing, I have witnessed his figure working hard in shadows without anyone noticing, still, th-that is, yes. He has no delicacy towards girls. Yes, that’s why you should definitely stop aiming for him.” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She blew all that abuse towards me at the girls endlessly. How is it even possible to speak so fast?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the girls who heard it smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, oh we understand, princess”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Among us… No, I don’t think any girl in the Imperial city is aiming to be Earth’s girlfriend.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right-♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, you’re making a fool of me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if I think about it normally, there’s no way I can be that popular.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in the last three years I have never been able to get a girlfriend. So, of course, I’ve never… I don’t have any experience with women!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s all because of that damn princess who keeps tarnishing my image to the girls! Maybe she hates me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, but it doesn’t matter. For me… generally, there’s someone I’ve already set my mind on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The name written as actually sound like the English word Fiancée. You may notice similar naming conventions from the author in this book. Watch out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Wow! Quite the rant! I smell a Tsundere in denial. I took a lot of liberties with this part but I believe the spirit of the scene is intact. 艶本 (tsuyabon) literally translates as “gloss book” and took me to some “cultural” sites so I’m assuming she referring to his porn stash!
