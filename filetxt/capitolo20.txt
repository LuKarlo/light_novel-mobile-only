 Image training during class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I won’t actually move my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… I…… I should have been in class, right? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s right. But with the magic you recently contracted, you now reside in the spiritual world that your mind has created. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An empty world of pure white that goes on infinitely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The differences from reality are supposed to be obvious, yet for some reason I feel that my consciousness is clear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The magic that you attained a while ago… Fantasy Magic, 【Vier】, tis magic that invites the target person into the desired dream. At times I dream when I sleep, but I am capable of intentionally conjuring the dream I want. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Dream intentionally… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But, as you have only learned this magic, this is as much as you can do. However, upon improving your skills, you will be able to dream of whatever you desire. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I learned it during the break after the first hour at the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic contract was implemented as Tre’ainar had instructed in the back of the school building.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like the Automatic Calculation Magic, 【Exail】, I drew the magic circle and performed a chant according to his instructions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I cast the spell at the start of the next class, it came to this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then, when I go to bed next time, if I cast 【Vier】 at the same time as ‘that hella long-looking ancient language chant’, will I be able to see ‘any kind of dream’? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis so. A dream of conquering the world… To be surrounded by women… anything. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh… Ooooh… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can you have any dream you want? T-Then, even if it’s a dream, it’s delicious… I wanna try a lotta stuff right away. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「However, this magic requires a degree of sophistication and imagination. Even if you dream of conquering the world, if the level you can imagine is low and lacks palpability, you can only reproduce half-hearted images. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… About that…… For example, no, really, just an example, but I don’t have any intention of using it for such a thing. E-Even if I dream of doing ‘ero’ stuff with Sadiz, I’ve never seen Sadiz naked, so will I produce only low level results there? 」 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「………… You are not mistaken, but… do not be astonished. Rather, how has he not realized that his mind is wide open? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, there is no problem even if he is shocked. Or rather, have I just been taught some awesome magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, when I used this magic, I didn’t think about anything in particular, and it was my first time using it, so it ended up like this. If I could improve the quality of this magic more…… even if it’s a little bit… If I could know more about Sadiz’s body… even though it’s a dream, happiness!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But you should be cautious. Tis a dream after all, but it can be reproduced as far as the intention of the wielder. Therefore…… it has been known to create addicts that are too engrossed in dreams and become blind to reality. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「As such, this magic was prohibited in the demon world. In a certain country, the populace engaged in dreams that were convenient for them, and as a result of escaping from reality, it was a place where they were so abandoned that they perished. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, you know, you should have told me that kind of heavy story before I signed up for the magic! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dreams become an addiction. Sure, if what Tre’ainar was saying was true, it could have happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the world of this dream, she’s so cute, she’s sweet on me, she’s chic, and if, for example, I get some bouncy b-boobs of course…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis not this 【Vier】, besides, as a man, just make it happen in the real world. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh!? Tre’ainar…… I see… everything I’m thinking is being overheard… no, before that! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar showed a frightening face that as I understood I could get the delusions in my dream in hand, but wait a minute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This is my dream, why are you here!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m currently dreaming this. But why is Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You and I have a spiritual connection. In other words, if you dream, you will share it with me. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Say what!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, I had no means of confirmation, but… it seems that the hypothesis was sound. With this, I can train you efficiently even during the wasteful class! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t tell me, even in the dream, we’re stuck together… we’re not into each other that way……… then, anytime I use this magic, he will be right there!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, if I get naughty with Sadiz in the dream, will this guy be watching!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… I am not particularly witnessing the scene, but as I can tell no one, it should be fine. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Don’t go——no! Just don’t go there -NO! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not daring enough to do that while someone is watching me. [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, crap… I thought I had learned great magic with great pains, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Anyway. Let us commence the training. Warm-up and martial art such as ladder training and stretching are to be performed in reality. Tis how muscular mass is actually gained. As such, here we shall focus on the forbidden spells. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I hung my head and he pretended not to recognize my mood, the training lesson began.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, but is there any point to that? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What do you mean? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. Because this is a dream, isn’t it? Then I can’t make a magic contract, being unable to do so in a dream can’t be helped, right? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, after all, this is a dream. It’s not real.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t make sense to improve your physical skills and magic in this world, and you can’t learn any new magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You need not worry about that. As I said earlier, this magic confuses reality with dreams. So getting the confidence to be ‘capable’ in this world is definitely useful in the real world. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Is that what you do… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Of course. And the magic you will attempt in this world… Although tis forbidden… you do not require a contract. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While reiterating the importance of image training, Tre’ainar said something strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic that doesn’t require a contract?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s, is that magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, I share this spiritual world just like you… In other words, in this spiritual world even you are within a spiritual body…… Nmm! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It is also possible to reproduce the old magic with an image! Huhahaha, I had developed this myself, this 【Vier】 is also quite the profound charm! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, there was something wrong with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It should not have been possible in the spirit body, light which seems to be magical covers his body, and the light turns into a red steam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Th-This is… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Can you do it? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… N-no」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This, rather than magic… is something controlled using only magic power…… In other words, tis not ‘magic’ but ‘technique’. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic control technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「If you learn this technique, you will eventually be capable of this. One of my favorite deathblows… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hi…death? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Dense and sharpened, the magical power that overflows as steam… Focused… Inflates! Hardens! And if you can afford it, give it shape, and if you can afford it, make it spin! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 H…… Huge?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh-What the hell is that… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, it is big. It’s big as a house or a building.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic gathered in Tre’ainar’s right fist overflowed, turning it into a sharp, rotating spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Great Demon Spiral ·【Devil Spiral Break】! Well, tis impossible with just two months, but eventually you shall be able to do this. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why, every time, this guy is so amazing, but his naming is sh*t!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The word spiral appears in both parts! Is saying it twice that important!? [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Name aside…… Well, tis good to learn step by step. First of all, this power…… I shall beat the image of this magnitude into you. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, w-wait!? Is it, you’re pissed at me right now aren’t you!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Here it comes! 【Devil Spiral Break】! 」 [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was worse than Phantom Sparring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it seems in a dream world he can actually attack me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the perforated…… No, all the flesh is already shredded and broken down into dust.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, really, it’s a dream world, but it’s a ridiculous experience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if it hurts anymore, I mean, to receive such a black-hearted attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, is this what he’s going to teach me, such a ridiculous technique?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it a good technique for such a person?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, before that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No ‘Devil Spiral’, it’s already a decent name! ……Tha… That?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eh!!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? …… Classroom……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor seems angry at the people in the class who looked back in shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The effect of the magic seems to have expired…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar muttered to me as I did not understand the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Devil Spiral. You’ve been slacking lately, haven’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Um, no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Apparently you’re making your own special moves in your dreams…… hmm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On that day, I was called the Devil Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, I am always indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I received a review again, and it is a state of breakthrough. Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thanks to you, the combat power exceeds 20000, and still,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sticking to the first place of the day. (I think it’s going to change tomorrow.)
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since I am in first place, I feel reluctant to change the pace,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think I’ll still do it as I have done so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your continued support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] イロイロ used here didn’t have meaning in any translator. However learnwitholiver.com says iroiro mean various, different kinds of, a variety of. So I took it a slang to this effect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Oooh! This is why the author didn’t provide a made up chant for the spell. Every teenager is gonna attempt it so they can spend quality time with their Waifus……… RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHES SPELL!! WITH FOR ME [JIBRIL]!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Soooo, how long do you think it’ll take Earth to realize, even if he wins the games and playtime with Sadiz he’ll still be in a similar situation??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Tre’anar’s move name has 旋 the Japanese word for spin;spiral as well as スパイラル which is phonetically pronounced Spiral. The original translation is ‘it has both spiral and spiral’ referring to both words meaning the same thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S5] Yeah! I think he’s basically using Gurren Lagann’s [Giga Drill Break] here. The author did admit he’s a fan!!
