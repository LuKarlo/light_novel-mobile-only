 Just as the air began to feel quite cold, the serious-looking Seraphs finally appeared from behind the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some were flapping their own wings, while others were astride the mysterious Pegasus.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know! Everybody, brace yourselves! Okay, don’t show me a scared face!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seraphs? Pegasus? What about it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This hippo… no, it’s a dragon!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on, if you are even a little scared, they’ll swallow you whole.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what happens, we glare at the opponent proudly, regardless of their strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s far enough! I won’t allow thee to go any further! Filthy Surface Apes! Turn away this instance!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the mounted warriors, having set up a formation like a defensive wall, waited at the head of the center of the formation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were different from the warrior maidens who appeared on the Surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They looked slender, but their muscles were quite toned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They stared at us with an extremely keen eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if they were looking at garbage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We are the ‘Guardian Angel Squad’ of Angela Kingdom! For the past thousand years, we have been an ironclad force that has not allowed any invasion by foreign enemies! Come any closer to this country, and face Heaven’s wrath!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a strong tone of voice and a confident, dignified attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What bothered me was that every one of them had the same kind of features as that “Prince”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do I put it, this is a miserable squad of men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, they looked like members of a theater troupe, all of whom likely being cooed at by women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Giving a speech right away. Also, how convenient.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I muttered involuntarily, Mr. Machio nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s a Seraph… but it’s certainly convenient.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Agreed, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “True! I’d be troubled if those cuties showed up again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those warrior maidens who appeared on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I had to fight them again… it would have been hard to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uho~, pretty good ass!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is there really a bastard who surpasses my crotch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although the opponents are Seraphs, they were men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I can hit as hard as I want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Have not allowed a single invasion in a thousand years? In other words, they have neither been attacked nor fought a formidable enemy for a thousand years.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Like that――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next to me, Tre’ainar said that. In other words, that’s how it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Earth! First of all, it’s polite to have a proper talk!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right away, Kamikaze Attack it is! Not, as I tried to give the signal, Kron stopped me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Kron, That’s not really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, even if we’re going to fight…… no, because we’re going to fight, I heard from Jamdi’el that at least this much is necessary.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The head that leads us is Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From that Kron, before anything else, say what should be said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to do that, I felt like just hitting them with an initial charge right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis certainly not unique. Let her do it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… in that case…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if Tre’ainar says so, then fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, I nodded to Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Hilly, please stop a little.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To the Seraph tribe! We of the Surface――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t stop… don’t ask th’ unreasonable so suddenlyyyyyyyyyyy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…… Heh??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m already flying at full speed! If I stop, with this weight, we will fall! As things are, I have no choice but to rush straight aheaaaaaaaaaad!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of suddenly fighting, Kron wanted to open with a verbal declaration of war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Hilua, who was flying with us on his back, is almost at the limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, if he stops, he will lose momentum and fall without being able to rise up again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you say that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, be gone, lower creatures of the Surface, or else… or… hey, heed my words! Listen… nay, halt! All hands at the ready!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We had no choice but to plunge right in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… erm, that’s… uh~ … in that case, all you Seraphs! Excuse our intrusiooooooooooon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraph men were trying to drive us away with a strong tone, but when they realized that there was no way to stop us, so they quickly instructed their friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a panic, Kron also said a few words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez! No other way! Let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHH!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So be it, here they come! Do not allow such ugly creatures and lower races into our country!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Understood!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had started.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child! You, the maid and Wacha stand at the bow and repel them off! Hold Kron back!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! Me, Sadiz and Wacha to kick the enemy in front! Keep Kron behind us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Place Machio’s group behind the ship! Have them repel any enemies coming from behind!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio, Elder Sis Tsukshi, Karui! Cover our rear!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Divide the remaining to the left and right, defend and intercept! Most especially, prevent any attack on Hilladon’s wings at all costs! Be wary of attacks from below!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The rest of you, defend the left and right sides! Protect the Hilua from all attacks! The enemy may attack from below, so watch out for that too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave everyone Tre’ainar’s instructions, stood at the bow and waited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Pegasus knights and Seraphs who appeared from the other side of the clouds come out one after another by the hundreds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, perhaps at the direction of the lead Seraph, all of them started to spread up, down, left and right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Do the enemy… intend to disperse widely and surround us? How convenient. Considering Hilladon, who can only fly straight, the front will be thinner, hence breaking through the front is easy as is.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right! Hilua, leave the enemy to us! Just go straight ahead!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiyaaaaaaah, n, no, no way, b, but I’m scared!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hilly, we’re with you! So do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron my lass, I’d go through fire, water, and clouds for you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… He was so negative at my words, but at Kron’s voice… got along with her more and more, he got me laughing without meaning to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Keep the enemy at bay. Weapons.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know. Hilua, it will be a little heavy, but please bear with me. Now, everyone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as she reached the predetermined spot on the ship, Sadiz magically took the weapons out of her extra dimension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were bows and other weapons lying around, but what everyone picked up from them without hesitation were dumbbell weights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, there were rocks for stone throwing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Since ancient times, stone throwing has been a sound tactic. With the development of technology, stone throwers and slings have evolved, but traditionally, they were thrown by sheer physical power. Now, trained ones. Show what your shoulders are capable of!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The strong men smiled as they held stones and other objects.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opponents are Seraphs that fly around the sky using magic and other means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuhaha, what are they doing? They hold stones and rubbish?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As expected of the Surface! Such barbaric ideas!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou will bear witness to the power of Heaven!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, the enemy scoffs at us, calling us ridiculous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Strike them down! Heavenly Bow Squad! Fire at once!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Understood!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while looking down on us, the Seraphs took their positions and attacked us all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bows strengthened by wind or other magic were shot all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, the outset is key, astonish the enemy’s heart.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here we go! 【Great Magic Spiral, Earth Spiral Tornado】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shot arrows surrounded us, and were all repelled by the maelstrom of tornado-like spirals that appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There was a magic user among them…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pay it no mind, keep going! Look, the wind actually subsides gradually…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I can’t keep the 【Great Magic Spiral】 active for a long time, but with Magical Breathing, I can do it for quite a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, there is still more to come, so I need to save my energy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right, now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ouh!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone wants to vent the anger and frustration that had accumulated, so I also watched the timing and released the 【Great Magic Spiral】, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even a stone from the ground… with a trained shoulder, can reach the heavens, right? It’s not quite as powerful as Earth’s Great Spiral, but… a stone that spirals and thrusts forward… 【Arcane True Zenith Gyroball】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, the wind has ceased! All at once … Hehbu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the stones that were taken from the Surface reached the Seraphs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Alright, follow Machio!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s show them, our shoulders trained by Magical Baseball!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Curve】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Slider】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Split Magic Ball】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Cut Ball】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One after another, without a moment to rest, stone strikes were hurled vigorously by the shoulders of trained men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, even if it is just a stone, if it is thrown vigorously, the living Seraphs will not remain unharmed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, it’s faster than holding a bow or casting magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, th, this is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are they!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not magic, they throw stones and rubbish…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, do not faltfubooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “One after another… nay, do not approach!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The faces of the angels, who had been taken aback by our successive projectiles, gradually began to distort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Curses, wh, what is, s, savage barbarians! Thou have no pride!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, while they complained, Hilua pushed forward aiming at a thin wall of upset enemies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
