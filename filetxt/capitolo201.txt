 “Don’t falter! Don’t retreat from those wingless primitive apes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But these brutes, buhhoh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Plunge straight in, and kick away the swarming enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructions were too simple as advice from the Great Demon King, who has the world’s biggest brain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, on the contrary, for us… at least for the men present here, this may be the instruction that can demonstrate the most power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shaaaah, let’s keep going, goraah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, arrows are flying again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What! Let’s hit them back, barbell unit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouh, 【Arcane True Zenith One-Legged Batting】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Pendulum Batting Form】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The accumulated pile was released all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone threw stones and dumbbells at the fair-faced Seraphs, and swung heavy barbells to knock them down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The momentum seemed unstoppable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no choice but to join them and get in on the action.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shaah, I’ll do it too! 【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m me, and I unleash my fist, which flies like a lashing whip that can be used in medium to long range…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Death Scythe, 【Imperial Style, Sickle Art…… Crescent Moon Rush】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz swung her Scythe and sent crescent-sharp vacuum waves wildly around her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Crossbow Archery… Magical Crossbow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wacha added magic to the two crossbows he held in his hands and shot them in rapid succession…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what the hell are they!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t get close!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The formation…… drat they’ve broken through!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, don’t let them get away! After them”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We broke through the thin formation of Seraphs assertively, and the Seraphs who came pursuing after…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “On top of destroying our hometown… we can’t afford to lose anything else we cherish. Whatever reason or cause you have, if you stand as a wall before us, we’ll push through you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Horizontal Chop】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just by swinging a chop with his brawny muscular arm, they were swept off by Mr. Machio, who could unleash a shockwave or a vacuum wave like me or Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absurd, what are they!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t the level of power of the Surface sufficient to deal with the knights led by the Prince the other day?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu…… Strong!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, hold firm! It seems the enemy is passing through!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, the Seraphs were “moderately” strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, they were only “moderately” strong, and had wings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If they were to completely look down on us and let their guard down, they wouldn’t be able to stop our current momentum, and once we get past them, they won’t be able to catch up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nhah, that’s kinda, amazing! Everyone is amazing! So strong! So strong and kinda, cool!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Hilua, who was ferrying us, was in a state of excitement, his initial fear already gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing this, Tre’ainar’s eyes lit up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Right, here we are! Pierce through the clouds without pause!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, Hilua!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We all go as one big mass, screaming and yelling with Hilua.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nhaaaaaaaaaah, Let’s Gooooooooooooooo!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gaining altitude, Hilua accelerated with a bang.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wind was strong enough to cut through the body, and if you let up just a little, you might shiver from the cold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, no one said anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pierce throoooooooooooouuuuuuugh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before us was a world of massive floating clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Into those clouds we plunge, going deeper and deeper, and broke through the dim world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sunlight that had been blocked on the way came through, and just as we were about to reach for it, we were thrust through the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We did it, Hilly! Amazing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Woohoo, awesome! Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Splendid~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well done.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You made it, right? That’s Hilly for you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We pierced directly above to the world of pure white clouds spreading all around us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All together, we clenched our fists and cheered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ehehe… Nhaah~, how embarrassing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hilua received our praises, and looked happy as he made a “Nihera~” expression. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is something to be proud of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without him, we wouldn’t have been able to reach this place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway… this is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were immediately struck by the vastness that spread across our entire field of vision, beyond our reach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… what a beautiful world.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone must have agreed with Kron’s unintentional remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s like a dream… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… for a moment, I forgot that we came to fight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, a world that seems to instantly diminish the fighting spirit which had us rushing in here all fired up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We could see what looked like land floating above a vast sea of clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Artificial islands above the clouds… the land of pure white clouds with regular arrangements of square tiles… all that material is made from clouds, is it not? They magically harden the clouds, process them, and then lay tiles made of cloud material on top of them.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar murmured calmly as we looked around the world above the clouds, but even after hearing the explanation, I remained pensive for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The dwellings are made by stacking materials of the same principle. An artificial lake made by melting clouds. Furthermore… unlike individual housing, a structure that can accommodate a large number of people…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Located in the center of the land on the clouds, was what seemed to be the main building of this land… a Castle?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, as far as the eye could see, it was a world dyed only in pure white to the point of being unusually free of a single stain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, look on the land.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, there are Seraphs.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Moreover, different from the women who attacked us or the men of a while ago …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe… citizens?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seraphs were looking up at us as we appeared, with uneasy expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless of age or gender, everyone wore a single piece clothing, and did not look like soldiers in any way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps, the Seraph civilians? No, I don’t know if there’s a word for that… but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『From their point of view, we are the invaders. You must have known that they would look at you with such eyes.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if it was the Seraph tribe who struck first… whichever side has a grievance… even if the intention in coming was to rescue someone… from their point of view, tis all merely an excuse for retaliation. Stay the course.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I began to feel a bit of confusion in my heart while receiving the gathering gazes, Tre’ainar immediately whispered into my ears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You knew this was going to happen and that we would be looked at with those eyes, didn’t you? And.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, maybe I just “thought” I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, tis too late to turn back. Also, child. This is no time to be idle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps, Jamdi’el may be found in that palace-like place.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was right. We came to this world to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― PAN!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A somewhat dry sound, like gunpowder bursting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fireworks? I don’t know, but it came out of nowhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at the next moment, I heard a voice that seemed to echo out into the world, or rather into my head, naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――EMERGENCY REPORT EMERGENCY REPORT. WE ARE SENSING TRESPASSERS IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT RIGHT NOW. ALL NEARBY GUARDIAN ANGEL SQUAD AND BATTLE MAIDEN KNIGHTS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY RUSH TO THE SCENE. REPEAT――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How about that? One after another, something can be seen popping out of the huge cloud structure in front of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou will go no further!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My people will not be harmed in any way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By my life, we will strike thee back to the Surface!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraphs we breached seemed to have hurriedly followed us and caught up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it wasn’t the time to stand around in a daze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…… From the capacity of that castle, there are still likely to be even more soldiers… draw more of them out…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Drive more enemy soldiers to sortie and draw them in. Also, tis about time you get Kron ready…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Does that mean… so soon?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, truthfully, you could hold back until the confrontation with the king of this country and the ‘little girl’ with the Heraldic Eye, but… you do not want to involve non-combatants, do you? Once the enemy forces are drawn out, Kron’s Daybreak Eye can put all the enemy soldiers and non-combatants together into a deep slumber.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By my side, Tre’ainar has always been calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? But, little girl? Who? It’s the Prince who has a Heraldic Eye, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
