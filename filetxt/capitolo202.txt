 “Over there! It is those Surface people, after all!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe they came all this way, what are the men doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In any case, their fortunes have turned! Our country will not allow this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Evacuation of the people with haste!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The women coming out of the cloud castle one after another were probably the same women who attacked the Surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouuuuh, filthy invaders, thou shall go no further!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Enough! Let’s get serious!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the men chasing us from under the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we had the best trained men with us, and Sadiz, the difference in numbers was huge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we fight while surrounded, we will be worn down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how much we’ve come to rampage, it’s not efficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are we going to do? Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiya~, lots of them here again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s a lot of people. If we had to deal with all of them, we’d be at a disadvantage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on our side, we have someone who can efficiently put our enemies to sleep all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘It’s okay, don’t worry. Kron, get ready.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When it was finally her turn, Kron nodded vigorously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, no matter how many enemies come, with Kron’s super powerful magic eye…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Such folly …… despite enabling thy survival with great care… the thoughts of incompetent apes remain incomprehensible.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, that voice echoed through all of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This voice is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From that time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Their expressions strengthened instinctively.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is… His Majesty!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heavenly King! Why would thou bring thyself?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the sudden voice that we heard startled not only us, but also the Seraphs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the voice belonged to the bastard that destroyed Cacretale with huge magic from the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is the king of this country called the King in the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Until the execution of Jamdi’el… for my designs on the Surface world… I truly intended to ‘procrastinate’… I never, to think thou would go this far… I doubt thy sanity.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… bastard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘However, as it has come to this, I see no issue in reneging on the promise to Jamdi’el. In our defense, the savage incompetent apes that have invaded our country shall be disposed of.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shocking voice of the Heavenly King echoed, and not only me, but all the dojo guys also had a look of impatience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, everyone had quite a bit pent up with this bastard. Various things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if we are barbaric, we are not willing to silently accept the loss or pain of anything else we hold dear!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron spoke hard at the voice of the Heavenly King that resounded to us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Thou art the doll girl, aren’t thee? Without Jamdi’el, thou can do nothing, yet who has incited thee to come this far?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was not incited! My back may have been pushed, but… I’ve come this far by my own will!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘What?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know why you think as you do of us on the Surface. I don’t know what Jamdi’el has done to you in the past. But just because I don’t know, doesn’t mean I will silently accept destruction and defeat by you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron does not take a step back against the Heavenly King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With strong eyes and voice, she shows the feeling of “fighting” to the forefront.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And everyone raised their voices to the tune of that feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. The High Priestess will definitely be saved~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! We are a family!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I lose my mentor here in silence, then what have I become so strong for?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re going to pay for what you’ve done to our country, you bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They shouted all at once that they felt the same way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Hmph. What can a few dozen do whilst outnumbered? But I know. The doll girl. I know thou have magic eyes equivalent to Heraldic eyes〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘It seems thou did not use it against Ga’al who was sent for power reconnaissance, but it would be more troublesome to use it here. And if that’s the basis of your hearts and minds… we shall do this!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the Heavenly King confidently mentioned that Kron had a magic eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does he know? That Kron has the Daybreak Eye?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… What will you do?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the confidence of the Heavenly King, Tre’ainar also wondered how things would go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘My subordinates … and Ga’al’s subordinates… stay back and keep those people at bay. It would be more trouble than it is worth if thou all became confused and fight each other.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Heavenly King??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Small fries of such caliber shall be suppressed by my own hands, by the Great King of the Heavens.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, he came here and stopped the wings of the Seraphs who were about to rush in with their huge armies numbering in the hundreds and thousands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Even so… did he foresee the Daybreak Eye? Tis surprising… well, to be aware of Kron’s existence, he cannot know…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar, what do we do? If it is true, the plan was to put the enemy to sleep, confuse them, and then take Jamdi’el back in the confusion of the moment, wasn’t it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? You need not be that desperate. I am thinking of various measures… but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected of Tre’ainar. He didn’t seem to be too upset by this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He calmly considered what the Heavenly King would do after this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As long as we are here, they must limit the use of great spells or artillery to annihilate the opposition, unlike what they did on the Surface. Otherwise this city will also be damaged. However, tis unlikely that the King himself will appear in a foolish and honest manner. As such…… what can be done to attack our forces by retreating…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… one way or another… what are you doing?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…’golems’… is it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was when Tre’ainar murmured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Weather Magick, 【Cloud Golem】!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the Heavenly King chanted that, the hardened clouds that were our foothold gradually rose, and eventually the clouds appeared in the shape of hundreds of people around us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait! What’s this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Golems…… this many at once?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is a golem, Sadiz Big Sis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bizarre…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was magic I’ve never seen before. Clouds becoming human shaped golems?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve seen sand golems made of a lump of soil, iron golems moved by compacting iron scraps, and golems made of water and fire, but I’ve never seen a cloud golem before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Individually, their power is not very great, but they are rather numerous.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Seriously… Tre’ainar, what are we going to do?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you were all to rampage, you may be able to manage, but… you will wear out and…… your numbers may diminish.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The numbers diminish. What that means is simply the same as “there will be deaths on your side”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, we’re here to fight. There was always a possibility that it would happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘I’m listening. Don’t confront the Daybreak Eyes directly… and such illusions do not work on the golems.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… you are listening? Who in this world is taking measures against the Daybreak Eye? …… from whom?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Now, start… and let us end it!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that Tre’ainar felt something clinging to the words of the Heavenly King, but now it’s not the time to worry about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, this number of golems… you cannot give overly complicated orders. Defeating them is not too arduous a task, but… still, you must cut off the origin of the spell, else they will come out forever.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The origin of the spell… you mean…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Defeat the Heavenly King, that is your top priority.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First of all, strengthen all allies with Kron’s illusions, then organize a detachment to strike at the Heavenly King.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Defeat the Heavenly King. Otherwise, this situation will not change.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, someone has to rush away from here and go face the Heavenly King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what I’m thinking… but I also have to consider what happens here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
