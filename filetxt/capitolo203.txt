 “Zee~, hah~, zee~, hah~… Phew~… I’m at my wits end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hilly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Hilua, who had carried us all the way here, finally reached the limit of his physical strength and landed on the cloud lands, wheezing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was enough that he had brought us this far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We landed on the clouds, no one had complaints.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… in the end, the Surface people put their feet on our land…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou… even now by this hand…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Halt! Have thou forgotten the words of the king?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraphs have such regretful expressions on their faces about us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They glared at us from a distance, as if they were about to jump at us, but were still only looking on from a distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Say, what is the King of Heaven asking?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And why should we not fight? We’re warriors who keep the heavens safe!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let golems fight, and we, Valkyries, to do nothing but lead our people to safety…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, why… rather the housekeeping Knight Order… even us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What was that? Is it we who play house?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, we weren’t allowed to finish the capture of Jamdi’el the other day, and on the way here, the King himself… are we not trusted?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know not, but… by the command of the King…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to protect this country, the Seraphs tried to surround and capture us, but they were stopped by the words of the Heavenly King and kept away from the battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can see some Seraphs expressing frustration at this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. After all, as Jamdi’el was screaming the other day… the new Heavenly King is not so adored it seems… then, he may as well act as he pleases.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar does not miss even such grumbles from the Seraphs, and he had a lot of bad variety of evil looks on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I’m curious how many tricks and what kind of bad things Tre’ainar was planning in his head, I’m a bit scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the worst case, all you need do is destroy the magic core that holds up this heavenly world. This cloud world is solidified by the circulation of a great deal of magical power. However, as long as tis magical power, there is a core that governs it. It would be just below that castle. Destroy it with a Great Magic Spiral, and this cloud world will unravel in an instant. Even if you use that as a bargaining chip…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Tre’ainar. Don’t say such horrible things, because only I can hear them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I’m told how to annihilate this country, I can’t say “Yeah sure” to that extent, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Now, my cloud golems. Crush those infidels!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the voice of the Heavenly King resounded again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte… Child. This way now.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Enemies attacked all at once in the words of the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile, the men who were already unable to restrain themselves against the new enemy that had appeared before our eyes jumped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s a golem! I’ll crush you with my fists!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, show them what we can do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Feel the Arcane True Zenith!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I could say anything to overcome this situation, a group of hot-blooded bastards jumped off Hilua’s back and took on the swarming cloud golems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not let them go too far ahead. The task here is to endure. They are here to hold out, not to go out on their own.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys, don’t jump out so soon! Fight to protect Hilua, maintain the 3 man parties we decided at the beginning!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, Little man. They don’t seem to hear you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For everyone who could only throw things or were limited in what they could do earlier, now was the situation where they can go as wild as they want on a foothold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, damn it, I might as well take on a few enemies…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hold, child. Do not use too much energy on golems that do not use much magic. Tell them that, as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The power of these golems is a level that even the people in the dojo can single-handedly defeat. But it makes them conceited in an unfortunate way, and… unless they notice, they forget to pace themselves, and will immediately get exhausted.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar says that, but it’s not that easy to get across.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith One-Armed Shoulder Throw】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shred, the Sword of the Seven Stars!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Thrust Technique】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dosukoiiiiiiiiiiii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, what the hell are these guys, they’re no big deal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, let’s smash em to bits!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar was right, although opponents are numerous, individually their power is certainly not great.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, because of that, everyone went wild without a break, and if we keep this up, we’re going to…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Double Lariat】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Mr. Machio swung his stiff arms around, generating a tornado of sorts, and blew away the cloud golems one after another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys were a little taken aback by the sheer destructive power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, follow Earth’s instructions. This isn’t a fight, it’s a battle to retrieve what’s important to us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A quick word, in order to focus the minds of everyone who was getting rowdy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see, guys! I don’t think we should scatter during battle~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Nunchuck Art】 Hwacha ~~, Acha! Wachachachachacha, Hwachaa !!…… Whew…… I’ll go back to my original place now that I’m a little more refreshed “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please, brothers! Hilly is too exhausted to move, okay!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yesh. Somebody protect me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following Mr. Machio, Elder Sis Tsukshi also gave a few words, and everyone who was excited finally nodded and returned to their original position.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This one will do.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s just like Machio. I can count on you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Yeah! This is the man for the job.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if we go to defeat the King of the Heavens with a separate team, if Mr. Machio is there… then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, everyone. It’s a bit unexpected, but calm down. Either way, we’re going into a fierce battle. Surround Hilua and defend this position as the main team. But that’s not enough to win. So…… I’ll leave this brawl and go blow the Heavenly King away in the confusion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a brawl involving this many golems. They won’t even notice if one of us goes missing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s too simple to call a strategy. In short, while everyone is working hard, we’re going to sneak out and defeat the enemy’s boss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Little man. It’s not safe to go alone! Then, I’ll also…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…… that’s right…… it would be reassuring if you came, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis ill-advised. She holds everyone’s weapons, and can use Recovery Magic. She can also be resourceful in counter-magic and situational assessment. It would be best if she remains and supports Machio.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… as support for Mr. Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is it Little man who is saying that? Or maybe, the invisible to me…… You-Know-Who?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Scary. When I tried to tell Sadiz to stay when she says she’s worried and wanted to follow, somehow, a tremendous, murderous gaze was turned to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly it’s dangerous to be alone, aye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t think so, Earth. At least one more person…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the others also expressed their opinion that I should not go alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me, I’m fine with it since Tre’ainar is with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis unwise to split our numbers down the middle. If tis you, child, one person will be enough. But if you were to take someone along…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, before Tre’ainar could name someone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Take me with you, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want to go! No … I think I should go. I have to go! I don’t know why, but I think so!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron raised her hand and came forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, she should suffice. After strengthening everyone with the suggestion of the Daybreak Eye, she would be more useful elsewhere, as the only enemies here are golems that are immune to her illusions. Rather, she would be an additional burden to be protected. As such, it would be better to work with the child and take her to that Heavenly King.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar had no objection to taking Kron, but rather seemed about to make the suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… seems to be the way to go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh, guh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I nodded to Sadiz with the meaning “Tre’ainar agrees” she was blatantly mortified.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Sadiz seemed to hate Tre’ainar more and more, and her glance hurts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, the second wave is coming!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You mute bastards… bring it on, if you dare!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s not the case when we have a strategy meeting forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Golems were blown away by Mr. Machio, but they generated one after another from the clouds, multiplied, and narrowed the circle while surrounding us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, Kron. Shall we go?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you! I’m inexperienced, but please treat me well!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Um, that’s a little inappropriate …… to say…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost lost it a little at Kron’s comment, but I regained my composure and held Kron’s hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Firmly squeeze it so that we do not separate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, we’re going to hold this spot until Earth and the goddess can complete the operation. Gritting our teeth and enduring is what we’re good at, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Macho is right~! Let’s see if we can hold them off here ~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stick together in groups of three and don’t get too carried away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you need medical attention, call me. I’ll be right there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, aye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oueehh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone seemed to have been convinced, and prepared to rekindle their spirit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time, they don’t jump out right away, just wait.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘What is this? I thought thou would rampage on thy own, fall to conceit and destroy thyself, but … art thou thinking to wage a war of attrition? Fufu, what unseemly struggle…〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The King of the Heavens laughed at our situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘I say…… hmm? What’s wrong, friend? What?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? What? Suddenly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘What else might be their aim? What does thou mean? The basis of warfare is the general’s head? What does that mean… Drat, we are still connected telepath――――〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was the Heavenly King talking to someone just now? Is there anyone nearby?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was carelessly broadcasting through a telepathic connection…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar, perhaps caught by what had just happened, put his hand on his chin and gazed at the palace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Although the people do not seem to really appreciate him… i still, is there anyone beside him who can advise the king? And there is a person whose advice the king obediently listens to. how unexpected…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that something to be concerned about… no, if Tre’ainar’s concerned, maybe it’s something important?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But either way, I have to go now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
