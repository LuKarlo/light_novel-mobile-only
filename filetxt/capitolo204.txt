 It seemed Tre’ainar was bothered by something, but in any case it doesn’t change what we’re going to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well then, everyone! Look me in the eye!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I signal Kron, and she nodded and called everyone’s attention to open her magic eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daybreak Eye, Activate! Magic Eye Skill, 【Placebo Kiaida】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, including myself, fell under Kron’s suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone. The enemy is mighty. But you can do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know how hard you’ve been training every day. Now is the time to grit your teeth and show off the results of your stoic self-improvement!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m motivated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll say it again and again. You can do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The heat was overflowing
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Defeat. The Enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Protect. Our Comrades.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone … if we can’t do it, who can!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we don’t do it, who will!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s go, everyone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uoshyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, let’s gooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, as always! To the heavens and the world…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Every one of you, all together, bring it ooooooooooooooooooooooooonnn!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Our roar resonated in the sky. In this world where the air is supposed to be thin, our enthusiasm made the air crackle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Our voices overwhelmed the Seraph warriors, who had no place to swing their raised fists and were ordered to stand by unwillingly, as well as those who knew nothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Those who won’t fight, back away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if they come at us, we will knock them all down!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here they come, don’t let any of them through! Beat them with your strength and stop them with your bodies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa, there’s nothing bulging in their crotches, bunch of mute bastards!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I can’t ravish it, I’ll erase it, cloud bastard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First strike always wins!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll prove with this Seven-Star sword that Arcane True Zenith is not the only Magic Sword in Cacretale!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kabaddi kabaddi kabaddiiiiii!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Howaaaaaachaaaaaaaaah!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the Seraphs, the emotionless golems were undaunted by our spirit and attacked us without hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I hope you don’t look down on the Surface too much! Sei! Hah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heavenly folk~, I don’t think you’re fast enough! Ha’haa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless of man or woman, raging as one mass, no mere golem could stop us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mumblemumble… right…… let’s liken the golems to the Great Demon King Tre’ainar… Fufufu one Great Demon King down, two Great Demon Kings down, three Great Demon Kings down. ……oh my, that makes me feel a little better.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even more so, now there’s Sadiz who was beheading the Golems with a really terrifying look on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey hey… what, those Surface people suddenly …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, the housekeeping Knight Order, isn’t it a little different from your information?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They are … strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That … the people on the Surface who couldn’t even reach the prince… are so……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, are things not dire?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’d best go as well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraphs were watching our scuffle at a distance. I could see some agitation, but it seemed that there was still no one who would disobey the king’s orders and come at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘…… tch… such annoyances… however, if thou rampage as much, thou will soon exhaust thyselves and be unable to move. Suddenly becoming quiet earlier, I thought we would wage an endurance battle with thee, such buffoons.〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although everyone’s rampage made him click his tongue, a sneer escaped from the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this momentum may be great, but won’t it suddenly overshoot and quickly burst as I feared at first?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, tis unlike a moment ago. Under Kron’s suggestion, everyone responds not only to the assumptions in their heads, but also with their brains and bodies. With such increased motivation, fatigue and pain will eventually turn into pleasure. Tis referred to as ‘Intracerebral Narcotic’. I call the state filled with it ‘Magical Runner’s High’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar dismissed the mockery of the Heavenly King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『These one, who were artificially put into Magical Runner’s High state by the Daybreak Eye… will not tire for a while!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, well, there is such a phenomenon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s true that sometimes, when I do a lot of running or exercise, I don’t get tired as much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, I want to do more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s eyes seemed to always keep us in that state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uhohohohohoho, insane! After peering into the eyes of the goddess… my crotch is so insane! Ouuuh, now you cloud bastaaaards, I’ll make you my Dutch-Husbands!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See, hey! Can’t the Seraph hunks over there come closer? Damn, what a kill-joy… Hahahahahahah, it’s not going to wilt even if I mess up a cloud bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I hate you! Thinking about it, not only the Great Demon King, but also that José, if he didn’t interrupt me, Little man would have been in an unstoppable boob-fest state with my girls, and he would still be… aaaah, I hate you! I hate the Great Demon King and I hate José!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, no. It’s getting too hot… I wonder if Machio’s muscles are too nice! No I shouldn’t, at a time like this, I’m such a… but oh, to be able to fight as a woman standing next to Machio, and those muscles are already mine… mushy writhing~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I guess it’s partly dangerous……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s about time, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, no matter where!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rest is timing. Get away from here and get to that palace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this second wave of enemies are gone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, oraoraora what’s wrong, Seraphs!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The heavens at this level, absurd!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So much for the magic of the Heavenly King.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re still on your mother’s teat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, everyone defeated the enemy with the momentum, but gradually became more radical, and finally ranted to the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this all right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, since the other party also calls himself the King, they’re so easy to provoke…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘What was that …? These lowly creatures! Say what about me… thou shall not be forgiven! Is the power I wield this level? Thou shall bear witness with thy eyes! No, don’t stop me, friend! I shall demonstrate my power to these cretins!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, he took to the provocation!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, apparently a close adviser who seems to be by his side tried to hold him back, but the Heavenly King would not stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘300 New Cloud Golem Reinforcements! Also…… also!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, he generated and increased more golems that have lost their numbers in a burst of everyone’s rage … and in addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Five Great Cloud Golems!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How should I put it … yeah … one after another, the newly generated stuck together and merged to create another huge humanoid cloud golem that was so big that it cast a shadow on us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s big…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked up and instinctively muttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the Heavenly King was getting serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, even though he is King… to lose yourself to simple provocations… unaware of the bottom, the Heavenly King.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child. Why do you stare at me with such eyes?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… it’s nothing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also easily pushed by my provocations… well, let’s not say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even if you can see the bottom…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, nothing to fear. Such a huge body, its movements must be slow. With my data ――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After all, it’s all show. By the Seven Stars beyond the clouds―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he is morally bankrupt, the opponent is the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Great White Punch!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uboh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some of the allies, who were undaunted by the big guy and were bracing themselves, were knocked away with one fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lyron!? Gran Chario!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the… it’s pretty fast for that size!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Ms. Sadis!? Please, two people!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A huge punch with considerable power. And four more bodies that can do the same thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, we are surrounded by hundreds of golems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘I’m still coming. Weather Spell, Megastorm. Weather Spell, Mega Thunderbolt. Weather Spell, Megasquall!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the Heavenly King chanted, the Great Cloud Golem’s big bodies came together and cast a spell on us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! Uh … Great Magic Spiral!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a hurry, I jump out and protect everyone with the maelstrom of the Great Magic Spiral, repelling all of the enemy’s magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I managed to avoid any damage…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Nu…… thou blocked it… huh? Friend. Thy eyes sparkle, why?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought the golem would use magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuha~… they are capable of magic!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You saved us… I’m sorry, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re amazing, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not the only one. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief in spite of themselves, but even though they were enthusiastic until a while ago, everyone’s faces suddenly became tense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, I thought they could only follow simple instructions… if he wants, can all the golems use Weather Magic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So it would seem. Tis a fairly advanced technique… that allows the use of magic through golems. Though depraved, it fits the occasion…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch! This is pretty tough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So far, the cloud golems had only simple movements, but there are five golems that are tougher than before, and above all, ridiculously large.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Hmm, thou seem to be able a little capable…… but how long can thou endure? I shall have you understand… thy sins of defying the heavens, in the depths of thy pores!〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It means that the King of the Heavens has taken the provocation seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What, do not hesitate, child. The fact that he exerted so much power should mean that the King of the Heavens has consumed a considerable amount of magic power. And from the accuracy of these golems and the magic contained within, the magic capacity of the Heavenly King may be roughly estimated. If you face him… he should be far easier to defeat than Jamdi’el.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, Tre’ainar’s calm doesn’t change, but rather tells me that this is more like an opportunity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, if we go according to the original strategy, it may be somewhat tougher, but I have to go…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, I can manage things here somehow. That’s what I do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, you and the Goddess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio whispered to me with a rugged face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said he would draw their attention alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even Mr. Machio, who is a true rock, would have to take on those five bodies alone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, look up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, a huge white fist was swung down from above my head, which was ugly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, stay alert!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Great Magic Spiral … won’t make it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My feet suddenly glowed, and at the same time a magic circle appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no idea what it was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis… Transfer Magic Circle…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what Tre’ainar murmured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Transfer? Why? A newcomer? Who the hell……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I did it, it finally worked!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An unexpected appearance suddenly emerged from the magic circle… eh? Why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously… tte, what the heck is that big thing!? Suddenly!? Oh, oh, yes, 【Megawind】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guy who appeared, surprised by the sight of the great cloud golems that suddenly entered his field of view and its attack, unwittingly unleashed his Wind Magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was magic that wasn’t specifically chanted or formulated for power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, its power was like a storm, and it flicked away the fists of the Great Cloud Golem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu~, I was surprised… but is this… Cacretale? Until now, the barrier warded and repelled us, but suddenly I thought it was gone and gave it a try… anyway, I don’t get the situation at all. but…… anywhere is fine, right? And I got to meet the people I wanted to meet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, he looked around and looked back at me… while unleashing such magic, and turned his smiling baby face toward me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… he’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who? That good kid?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uho~, I like.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone but Sadiz was tilting their heads at the sudden appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I know him well. So does Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… are …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those were the only words I finally got to say.

 “Hey, Earth. Who is this person? …… tte, Earth! Behind you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuo!”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, man, I was in a daze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dozens of golems from behind me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why? Don’t be silly, do I need a reason?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t go thinking you can run away from us forever. Hey, Earth… h, hey! Y, y, y, you’ve been, holding hands with th, th, tha… eh? Hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re kidding me, right? These two pierced, crushed chopped up the golems that attacked me from behind in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A long-haired, tall, handsome swordsman, and a spear-wielding princess who glared at me with a haughty attitude…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuun~, why even me… eh? Is this Cacretale? No…… clouds? Eh? That? …… ah… by any chance… is this where…’he’ is…!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huuuuuuuuuuh! Eeeeh? As for this person, seriously, why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A reclusive former classmate of mine, a girl with a flute, scurrying around with a surprised expression on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Above the clouds? Are we in the sky? But I’ve heard that the sky is freezing, but it’s so hot. No, this heat. It’s the surging pathos that’s burning me up. Yes, this is love!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s with this lineup!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t say anything anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A beautiful girl who confessed to me …… that she has a crush on me …… with her long black hair flowing……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey, is your chastity still safe?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Heeeeeeeere? Eehh? Um, oh, eh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Also… you two are holding hands very firmly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But that’s her, right? Finally, I was able to meet her and at the same time as our reunion … surprisingly though, she was a demon…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And she saw Kron holding hands with me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You must be Ms. Sadiz, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes? No? I’m not?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And they’re tilting their heads at the same time… sorry, I want to tilt my head, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why are these “five people” here?

 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your continued support. This story has finally reached 200 chapters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am glad that I was able to reach it before the end of the year and even before the book was released.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think the reason I was able to reach this milestone sooner than I thought was because of all of you who are always giving me hot drills and infusing me with spirit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Comprehensive evaluation 110,000 drills. Impression 5000 impacts. Review 20 spirits…… In addition, the reviews received new one spirit last night, and I do not feel like stopping anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Please continue to give us all your support and infusions of energy. It encourages me to go further and aim for more beyond the heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will work harder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your continued support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And sorry. I really thought about reintroducing “these guys” at a different time and in a different situation, but I decided to bring them out in this form.
