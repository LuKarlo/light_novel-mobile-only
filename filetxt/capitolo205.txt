 Why? They got angry when I asked. But even so, that’s all I can say now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys… what are you doing here? On top of that…… even Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Should there be a reason for a woman to come to the man she fell in love with?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh~, why is she suddenly doing this after three months apart… my face was getting hot…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my! How lovely! Is this Earth’s lover?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Kron took her hand off me with a twinkle in her eyes at Shinobu’s words and happily grabbed Shinobu’s hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? You understand, don’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understand, Earth is so wonderful!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed. That goes without saying.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! You also seem like a very nice person… you two look good together!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…ah…that’s an unexpected response. I thought you were a thieving cat… but I…… can I hope to make friends with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To be friends!? I would be so delighted!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, so peaceful and heartwarming? Such a scene was unfolding before us, no, you guys! Right now……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Who art thee!? How have thou crept into this heavenly world, sullying our lands with your feet. Such scoundrels! Cloud golems, take them―――〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~ … The reunion with my beloved Honey? If you interrupt a maiden in love…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘…… Nuh?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You won’t survive the burn! Fire Ninja Arts, 【Crimson Lotus Spiral(Guren Rasen)】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 〘Eh!?〙
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And just as the Golems were about to attack Shinobu and Kron en masse, Shinobu suddenly blew out a flaming spiral from her mouth, and instantly wiped out dozens of Golems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really. Unable to read the atmosphere at all. Perhaps because it’s so thin above the sky.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a generous smile… I mean, what a… by normal standards, tsue~…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow! Amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa! Th, that girl is awesome!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She spit fire from her mouth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s friends? No, Lover?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… does Ms. Sadiz know, aye? …… what’s with the Ninja Warrior…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I suppose this means you have been working together since then? But I haven’t accepted you as a partner for the Little man yet, have I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, the allies were surprised at Shinobu’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeeeii! Wa, wait a minute, Shinobu! F, for a while now, I’ve just listened in silence, a, also the girl there, Earth, she’s been flirting with your hands!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the princess, who was even more air-headed than the Heavenly King, made a hassle in such a situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? You have complaints about something? Princess Phianse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! I say it almost every time, but Earth is …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my! Are you someone who is also aware of Earth’s charm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? H, hey! How many years do you think I have known Earth! Me, an ‘also’? Don’t confuse me with the rest of you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Geez, this princess. Hearing the conversation between Shinobu and Kron was embarrassing enough, but she actually told the two who thought well of me, “Don’t put us together”. Well, I know this person doesn’t really think well of me, but… no, that’s what she’s been doing for years…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is also Earth! I haven’t seen you in three months and, d, doesn’t matter… she doesn’t seem to be human, but who is she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, well… something like…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this was always the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, this was not the time to explain all that… as usual, this princess is a pain in the ass…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, well, I’d be happy if you could tell me about Earth’s female relations later, just in this situation…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, where are we… and what are you doing now? There’s even a hippopotamus with wings… the golems made of clouds… and there seems to be winged demi-humans over there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although a little surprised by such a princess, Fu and Rebal were beside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I know these guys have questions they want to ask me, but there’s something I want to hear, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But right now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I don’t really need an explanation.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surely this is not the place for talking. What is important is how you feel about the current situation as you see it with your own eyes and how you judge it. For me, Honey is fighting hard. That’s enough. If you fight, I’ll fight with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Shinobu suddenly insisted, as if to cover Fu and Rebal’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was totally flabbergasted in spite of myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A… are you sure? Asking no questions…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, even if I regret my reason for fighting later… it just means my judgment was wrong. But the outcome, wrong or not, is something I’ll know later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, but I can tell you this. I don’t know if my decision is wrong or not, but this love is not wrong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 C, come on, no way… my face was so hot, how embarrassing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At a time like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I crouched down, feeling as if I had been punished for not seeing her for the past three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wai, wait a minute, Shinobu! Th, then, me too! Th, there’s so much I wa, want to ask Earth! Ever since ‘that day’. But…but now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I was getting lost to Shinobu’s words, the princess interjected as if to reprimand us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, the “that day” that the princess mentioned was that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the day of the Commemorative Graduation Match, the day I ran away from everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now I’m just going to fight alongside Earth, who is desperately trying to fight! I have no hesitation about that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the princess also seemed to have things she wanted to say, preach, and ask me, but she still says she will fight for now, and held up her spear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When they heard the princess’ words, both Rebal and Fu nodded, smiling bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dear me… you’ve always been so… but things being like in the old days once in a while isn’t bad?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I agree. Princess, Earth, Rebal and me. The four of us, working together to fight something… I’m glad to see a day like this again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They squint their eyes as if reminiscing about the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re the leader. Now… I’ll fight with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a little awkward with Fu, but not with Rebal, since our fight at the Graduation match had an unsuccessful conclusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Rebal, while sensing this, dared to say let’s fight now and didn’t talk about the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t dawdle, Coman. For now, some people are wounded, go give them some help!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, y, yes, princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I don’t know how she got involved, or really why she’s here, but I’ll ask about Coman later anyway…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I mean… Earth? Does that mean these people will fight with us, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you old friends of Earth? If so, we can count on you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aya~…… this is also in a sense, the greatness of youth aye… everything from the lineage…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, let’s fight together. No one was against that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I appreciate it. Princess. Master Rebal. Master Fu. Ms. Coman. And Ms. Ninja warrior?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, you’re safe… Well, you’ve spent the last three months… with Earth and all… Or rather, what the hell is this woman doing here while you’re here… among other things… anyway, I’ll hear about it afterwards.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, eh, th, this is Ms. Sadiz!? …… I see…… I’d like to have a woman-to-woman talk with you later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my! You are all going to fight with us? How reliable! I’m so glad!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be a bit of a jumble of members, but it’s true that if you consider just the simple strength of the group…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘I can’t let myself be outdone. Young ones. My muscles are aching too.””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This guy… he’s overwhelmingly strong. And if you look closely, the others are also well trained… and with such people in tow, Earth really is a very good man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now now, Rebal, Now… together with our leader!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uwah~, I don’t know what’s going on, but it looks amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I don’t feel like losing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here we go, Kron! You guys!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right! It’s the second round!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uuooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here, it’s a dash to the Heavenly King!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tomorrow, it’s going to be unleashed to the world… and… whether or not Shinobu will be born as a picture…will depend on tomorrow?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 December 14. Everyone, prepare for a raid on the bookstores!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
