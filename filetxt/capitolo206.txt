<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I rushed to Daddy after receiving the report of the invaders, only to be given but one order, “stand by”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was told not to do anything unnecessary, so I couldn’t sortie and merely looked down at the city from the palace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My little birds and the Guardian Squad were not allowed to fight, only guide the evacuation of the people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only Daddy’s golems were in battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The golems, however, were overwhelmed by the furious momentum of the Surface people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Mu~… why, that demon woman held Earth’s hand… uh, he’ll definitely get a sermon later! Until then, I’ll pierce you all!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Fufufufufu, oh dear, Little man is so popular~ I’m happy, but also a little frustrated~]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, I’m not so narrow-minded that Honey touching another woman a little bit would offend me, am I? It’s just not funny, so I’ll let the melancholy slide.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Warriors of the Surface, united under one will without taking a step back in the face of Daddy’s mighty power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [We can count on Earth’s companions to lend us a hand. I’m Machio. What’s your name?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Rebal… you know of Earth’s strength…?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [I know it very well. I fought him recently and lost.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Huh!? …… ah I see… same as me. I lost to him, too.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hoh~]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [So Earth… faced someone strong like you… and won…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Fu~, well, that’s the way it is. Then, we’re both losers. But let’s make this our comeback.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 […… yeah, I’m with you.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The strength to kick away Daddy’s golems one after another while chatting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just watching them fight made my heart flutter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of danger as their fangs were digging into the Heavenly World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I’m here still.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daddy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can stand it no longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So in the throne room, I gave my suggestion to Daddy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Permit me to sortie! They’re quite skilled. But if Daddy’s golems are joined by the Valkyrie Knights and the Guardian Angels in this battle…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold your tongue! Thou do not understand how troublesome this would be for thee, a failure who art incapable of resisting the manipulations of a Magic Eye! Stand down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the frustrated Daddy only looked displeased at me and didn’t listen at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daddy… however, with my Heraldic eye, surely I can resist …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou…… lowly creatures. Do thou not comprehend? With my magical power, I can further strengthen the golems! Or…… deploy my hidden hand…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No longer am I in Daddy’s sights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The King of the Heavens, fighting all on his own, refused the aid of his comrades, subordinates, or family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Were I stronger and more reliable, would he have done something different?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, come now~ Dick, you got this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even though Daddy is such, there is only one being whose words he hears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the only one in this country who calls Daddy with such familiarity as “Dick” from “Dekte’ita” as a nickname.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Friend, this is no time for mirth! If thou know of them, tell me everything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha no, no, no, I also, got no clue what’s going on, I’m just as surprised.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, it looks like we got a surprising girl here…… so we’re going to have to get a little instruction from ……that young lady.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu? Who art thou referring to?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Look, that flute over there is… tte, hey Dick, let’s cut the telepathy, shall we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Daddy also listens to his friend’s advice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Friend? That man who appeared in this country a few years ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Had it not been for that man, Daddy would not have become the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, Daddy trusts that man more than anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, much more than I, his family…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe it’s… because I’m a failure… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If only I could do more…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Ga’al! How long art thou standing there! Don’t just linger and keep the people away! From now on, I will perform the final techniques of my golem magic… by combining the five great cloud golems… to summon ‘The Ultimate Perfect, Great Cloud Golem’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooh! That’ll get things going again! Yay, that’s the Heavenly King for ya!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were more capable… I would live up to Daddy’s expectations… instead of being a failure… nay……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Nay…… I…… I’m no failure!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll prove it with results.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That I am not a failure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Daddy became a new Heavenly King. I… I’ll make him acknowledge me… as his child…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without fail!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha… ah… young Ga’al… you’re much too shortsighted…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What’s wrong? Friend.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s nothing ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let us sortie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will not push it all on Daddy alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, it is I. Ga’al. Attention all members of the Heavenly Valkyrie Knights.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the palace, I hear only the sound of my running, for most of the warriors of the palace are currently outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, the warriors ready for battle are already waiting outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will be disobeying Daddy’s instructions, but with all the responsibility on my shoulders, I can send forth all the warriors who are waiting right now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ara?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me as I went down the grand staircase of the palace and was about to exit the main gate…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ridiculous… thou art…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? We met on the Surface… the man who hurt my cheek and… that doll…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe… never thought I’d see you again like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good day to you, pardon the intrusion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou… scoundrels…… why art thou here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because they were in the city with the golems… and yet they’re alone in this castle… for Jamdi’el’s rescue?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nay, perhaps…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Where is the King of the Heavens?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Their purpose is Daddy! While others fight the golems in the square and garner attention, a small group aims for Daddy… with these two?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Does thou expect I would tell thee?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In that case, I’ll beat it out of you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does thou think I shall let thee go?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll push right through you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, he stepped forward from the front without any hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My opponent had the leeway to have a broad smile upon his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I don’t understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Why go so far…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because you took something important from Kron and everyone else, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You mean Jamdi’el? Thou have no notion of how much she has―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I don’t care about that stuff anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to save Jamdi’el, the great sinner who has committed unforgivable sins, he has risked his life to rush from the Surface to this Heavenly World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do so much? When I tried to question him, he smirked and moved forward further.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not about who she really is, what she did, or anything like that. It’s just that there were a lot of people in that country…… people that I got along with… that don’t want to lose her. I’m just trying to help with that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I just want to reward them…… for accepting me as me. That is my reason… and that’s also why… I want to repay the debt from what you bastards have done to them!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I was perplexed by the words of the man in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A human man, shorter than I, and I suspect, much younger in age.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, his words were――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! Breakthrough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Earth Misdirection Shuffle】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was his unique fighting technique, he used it on the Surface!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t allow it! Heraldic Eyes―― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the same technique will not work again. With my Heraldic Eye, I’ll see through―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Body Blow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Upuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… see. throu… all? Eh? Wh… what is this? Internal organs… my body… deep within…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Urup, go, gaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell? You have very soft abs for a guy, don’t you? I can’t believe you got down on one knee with one shot.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ridiculous! It’s much more complex than it looked on the Surface… faster…… and…… what, in heavens is this punch!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nay, one blow? Against me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the Surface, he was already exhausted, but the truth is, this… had this much……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is for what you have done on the Surface. If you step aside, you can keep that handsome face of yours from a beat down. But if you stand in my way, even I don’t know what will happen.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th… this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, this is a raid!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the man before me, though smaller and younger than I, looked ridiculously large.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, we were able to reach today. I pray for the rest. This is the last prayer of this year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come on, let’s break into the bookstore!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, about the manga, it will be out next spring … probably.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know the details yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
