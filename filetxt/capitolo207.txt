 “Are you all right, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, don’t worry. Step back. I’m not going to lose.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I believe in you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until here, in the sky, above the clouds, I had done enough warming up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My body was warm and sharp enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, with Kron’s magic eye, I’m in my best condition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku … thou art capable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My best is yet to come.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t feel like losing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Fufu … so thou claim… Boy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahaha, kids these days have no discipline, a little provocation, and they’re in over their heads, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My body blow brought him to his knee and distorted his face, but it doesn’t seem like his fighting spirit will break with only one shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He opened the Heraldic Eye in both eyes and slowly stood up…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the prince tried to get up, I bent my knees and sank my body, then unleashed a low-altitude smash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, the swing was too big.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince rolled on the floor on the spot and hurriedly distanced himself from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it was a bit of a chance, so I suddenly used a big technique, so it can’t be helped…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, how do you like that? The feeling of a Seraph rolling around on the floor”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, boy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, not only were his eyes opened, but the color of the eyes also changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No more … stay alert!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like he recognized me not just as a boy, but as a powerful enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Giga Rose Thorn】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, with his hands on the floor, cast a spell as he yelled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, a thick, prickling rose vine shot out from the floor and attacked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I get caught, I will be unable to move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, such false threats will no longer work on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… eh??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shockwave on the left at the speed of sound.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If his is a giant rose whip, mine is a fist whip.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I deflected all the rose vines that reached toward me, and on the contrary, crushed them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… thy fist? My Giga-class magick!? Is this magick? No, martial art?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong? You’re just idling away in thought. Do you have time for that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte… 【Giga Rose Whip】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One after another, I crushed every vine that emerged from the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the vines were crushed and fell to the floor, I made them a blind spot and moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it okay? What are you doing, making it harder for yourself to see?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Earth Misdirection Shuffle】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of that, I move around in this space with more footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Scampering about… but, however much thou move, with my Heraldic Eye…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can you catch me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Heraldic Eye. As it is known to be legendary, having that eye is probably the basis of the prince’s heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, if this had been my first time, I would have felt threatened by the eye’s ability.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fear not. After all, this one was raised in a lukewarm heavenly country. You, on the other hand, have faced the Heraldic Eye of Jamdi’el of the historically renowned Six Supremacy that were forged in a hundred battles, and survived. Play on with confidence.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. This guy is…… weaker than Jamdi’el. There’s no need to be scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, nu … right? Left? Ah, the rear? Stupid… wha, what in heavens? Every slight… arms, head, glance…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if you can see my magic, you can’t see through my movements, can you? 【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Prince tried to capture my movement with his eyes, as if to undermine what is hidden behind the movements and disrupt them, but by making meaningful and meaningless movements, he was at my mercy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I released my fist and finally caught the prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, uh … fast!? Tsu, it hurts…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oruaaaaaahh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince tried to guard him by crossing his arms, but my flicker tore his skin from above the guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His guard was up, as if he didn’t want any attack on his face. Covering your eyes, what were you doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you are doing that, I’ll just go with that theory…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Body Blow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ubu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My shot landed again, in the exact same place as before, not an inch of difference.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The face of the prince, as he trembled and sobbed with convulsions from his toes to the top of his head in an instant as if in agony, was completely defenseless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I slam it into his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Corkscrew】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A fist to destroy the opponent’s head. Add a twist and screw it in more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a good response.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gatsu…… Kah, um…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince ate my hit and rolled again while being knocked to the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was decisive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His Heraldic Eye can’t catch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nonsense… me…… with hands and feet… I have the Heraldic Eye… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahaha, you got bad eyes, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince looked up as if he was taken aback by my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the beautiful, sculptural face is swollen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou dare to hit me. Even Daddy never hit me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. But what about it? I don’t think getting hit is a good thing, but I don’t feel like losing to a guy who’s never been hit before.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh … wh … at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I don’t feel like losing, that doesn’t mean I’m going to underestimate him and let my guard down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, the opponent may seem to be lying on the ground and full of gaps, but the prince was considering the distance between us properly, and the moment I try to close the distance, I guess he might unleash rose vines from the floor with the same magic as before, but that’s not going to happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Straight】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhwa?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shockwave from a distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even with the Heraldic Eye, there was no way he could avoid my punch from his fallen position since he couldn’t keep up with me, and the prince rolled again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gahah…… im, posible… me…… hands and feet… strong…… thou was…… so strong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince was hurt by me and let out an involuntary squeak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he did not crawl away as it was, but got up, whipping his aching body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… no matter how strong thou art, I cannot let thee go any further! I will not… disappoint Daddy! For his recognition… I cannot lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shouting this, the Prince took up a stance with the will to fight in his eyes again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I got a little caught up in what he just said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His father is the Heavenly King. So, I thought it was “because he was my father and my family” that he would protect the King of the Heavens, but now he said “make his father accept him”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Do you want your father’s approval?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Never mind…… it’s nothing to do with thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who thought that he made a slip of his tongue, held his mouth in a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I saw the situation, I just spoke unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re just trying to get your dad to recognize you… huh? Pretty much…you’re a narrow-minded bastard?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, in my ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, boomerang.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar, with his arms folded, pushed in, but I ignored him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inexcusable… in essence…… what would thou know? What about me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, naturally, he reacted as always to the words I said, that I didn’t know anything about his life and had nothing to do with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for some reason I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is your father the only one in your field of vision… or your world?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You want to be recognized by your father… I’ll make the world recognize me someday!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t mean to preach, and that’s exactly what I said, even though it should have had nothing to do with this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, although the prince looked slightly pouty, he immediately laughed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha… the world is it… why not save such grandeur for after thou beat me first?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure, in seconds!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I rushed in and closed the distance in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince reacted instantly, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both eyes wide open, he tried to see through my every move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sometimes, feints become feints, by not doing them?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he reacted too late after seeing my left. All according to prior predictions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I pierced all the way through…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My left took the prince’s lower jaw. The next moment, the prince crumbled in place like a puppet with broken strings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kah, ah… ah… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the front, a simple left jab with no tricks or feints.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, it became a feint, and the prince was hit squarely, his brain was shaken and he went down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking down at the prince who had fallen in front of me, I clenched my fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince was by no means weak. Even more so, he had a legendary magic eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was the one who won.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what it is. I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, child. Are you not getting stronger? After your battles against Machio, Jamdi’el, and the Dragon King of Hades, you have been further refined.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And those words made me happier than anything else that could be said right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Kron wasn’t here, I might have thrown a guts pose in excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if my father doesn’t recognize me… if there’s someone who recognizes me as I am… At least, I’m…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… As such…… you are transparent…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, I didn’t care because I was so happy, so I just did what I thought in my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
