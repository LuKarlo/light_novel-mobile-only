 While looking down at the prince who crawls and cannot stand up, I realize that I have become stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeaarth~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the goddess who had been silent all this time jumped at me with excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re amazing, Earth! I knew that Earth was strong and cool, but today’s Earth was better than I knew!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I, for one, am thrilled. My heart is beating so fast! I mean, Earth is so amazing~, right now. Do you understand?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron pushed her soft body against me and hugged me while thrusting out her chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m already active, but I don’t know what it feels like to be a man. It’s cute and embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, calm down.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I’m sure the King of the Heavens is up ahead.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, nothing is over yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As long as we haven’t beaten the enemy boss, the golems that everyone is fighting outside won’t stop either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. If you lose to him, Jamdi’el and everyone… isn’t that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, who was frolicking, also tightens her loose face again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But——
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Eh, child! They come!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, Tre’ainar suddenly roared-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If thou don’t want to lose, die.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shadow approached from behind Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They raised their hand and tried to target Kron’s thin white neck…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, tch…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Tre’ainar hadn’t told me about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not let your guard down while telling others to calm. This is the belly of the enemy, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Tre’ainar scolded me, I nodded and followed Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch… couldn’t kill the magic eye doll…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man, who was disrupted by my left, was not able to kill Kron and clicked his tongue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man was dressed in a pure white robe, and on his back were wings, a testimony of a Seraph.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He has a scraggly white mustache, but his head was smooth and shiny.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a sharp eye, his whole body emitted an angry atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Da…… di…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who had fallen to the floor and was crawling, muttered in a murky voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re… the Heavenly King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even standalone golems have a time limit. And I have no intention of conversing with filthy lower creatures. Die.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without answering my question, the bearded old man was coming towards me again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does this mean that he thinks Kron was such a threat that came to catch us off guard?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, he didn’t answer, but this guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m most certain. If I rid myself of Kron, other soldiers can be deployed. Golems lack a decisive strike, so I must stealthily act with my own hands… such is how it must go. Well, for thou and Kron to be here, it was most unexpected, and yet…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There seems to be no doubt. Even though he was a king, he was very impatient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How careless of thee. This is an opportunity.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Exactly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron, he’s coming. Don’t leave my side! Get your eyes ready!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we defeat him here, it will all be over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t make light of me! Even with magical eyes, in the end she is but a little girl! If I fight by focusing only on thy feet without making eye contact, nothing can go wrong! Blow up! 【Gigastorm】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ve come this far, I suppose, because you don’t look your opponents in the eye like that! 【Great Magic Spiral, Earth Spiral, Sonic Impact】!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we’re indoors, he shot a powerful wind magic spell at me and Kron, but I quickly intercepted with a shockwave of the Great Magic Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuku!? My magick…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, you see. Because you don’t look closely enough… you can’t really understand the enemy in front of you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, amazing … kyaa, the wind…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. If you don’t look closely… closely…… White…… String…… not that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is the one I have to keep my eyes on and blow away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoraaaaaaaaah!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The clash of the storm and spiral created violent whirlwinds and turbulence in the palace, destroying the walls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, they canceled each other out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, did you finally see me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even though we were evenly matched, from the King of the Heavens’ point of view, he may not have thought that I could use a technique as powerful as his, and like the prince, he had a surprised expression on his face as he looked at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daddy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ga’al…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, hah~… Daddy…… be wary… he is…… strong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Prince was almost blown away by the clash of our techniques, but he crawled to the feet of his father, the Heavenly King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the child who is worried about his father… a child who fought against the enemy but was defeated and covered with wounds on the floor…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imbecile! If thou were better…with the Heraldic Eye, what is this plight?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How far will thou go to disappoint me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The father trampled on his fallen child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In place of the former King of the Heavens, who was content with such small environs without expanding our world for over a thousand years, I, as an apostle of the true god, have the responsibility to expand the world, supervise it and guide all life. And if thou, the Son of the King, should be so useless…how utterly disappointing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is…… the Heavenly King? King?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He just looked like a domestic violence bastard to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How terrible… my goodness…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a scene that even Kron had to hold her mouth shut to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good, I’m not the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The scene unfolding in front of me was absolutely appalling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That eye is wasted on thee. Hey, Ga’al… gouge out those eyes and hand them over to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If thou disapprove, take off your clothes and conceive my child! Oh, yes, that would be better! 　Thou who was born in exchange for the death of my beloved wife!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Daddy…… Wha, what… the.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I shall have a more decent heir this time――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My anger has reached its peak, and I’m at a loss what to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That prince, too, his expression was saddened by so much of his father’s remarks, and he looked weak, as if he were a child or a woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have you gone mad? Are you crazy? A father to his own son ugh I feel nauseous… yeah…… I can’t take it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fugu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fucker was yapping about something, but my hand was out before I noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Heavenly King, who was completely off guard, was punched out by me, and somehow regained his posture and stopped, but bled from his cheek.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou wretch! What! In the first place, this nothing has to do with thee―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut it! If you don’t want to love your child, then don’t meddle in your child’s life any more. Shut your mouth already, you bastard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wh, at? Wh… towards me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in a way, this is… after all, I felt somewhat uncomfortable at first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, for the time being, I don’t have to hesitate to blow him away. I’m glad you’re such a piece of sh*t.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Striking at the enemy’s country and knocking the king of the other country was something that can’t be undone… so…… I was relieved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… this is why…the ignorant folk. Thou know nothing. My friend taught me. I am the apostle of God who controls the world and guides all life… why art thou so ignorant?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not how you get people to understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Heavenly King sighed, as if mocking and making fun of people. I was not in the mood to listen to what he had to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll make an opening and give the signal. Then… can I count on you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Kron listens to me, and Tre’ainar gives me the best timing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fu~, child… huh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This Heavenly King… insane eyes… incoherent remarks… missing hair… short-tempered personality… solid footing at the moment, but… hmm…… surely not…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, beside me, Tre’ainar had a difficult expression at the Heavenly King, as if he was concerned about something else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Thank you for purchasing the book. I don’t know if the second volume is going to roll out, but I’ll still do my best. Review in dense forest… I’m glad that I got the spirits! I’m so happy I don’t know what to take off anymore.
