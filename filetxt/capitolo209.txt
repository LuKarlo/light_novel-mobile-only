 “I am King! An apostle of God! No, I am a God now! All who defy me shall be put to death!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, Prince… you really have love for such a scum of a father? I mean, will being recognized by someone like this make you happy? Or maybe, is this normal in this country? Cultural difference, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Heavenly King shouted with madness and emitted raging magical power from his whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Silence, silence, be silent! I had surrendered to a thousand years of malaise and futility… but I have awakened! My friend taught me! I am the King! The lowly creatures that pollute the Surface! They must be exterminated and ruled! I shall build a new legion of God! Jamdi’el, the doll, and Ga’al, I shall rip out their eyes, and have them give birth to my progeny, surely the strongest――――”

 “【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No more, I’m beyond disgusted and offended, I’m just completely fed up with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I strike with the shockwave of my left whip.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, this… braaaaaaat!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t want to talk any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heavenly King!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know what it means to be a parent and child … or to have children… but I’ll just say this! I, will never have your child! I don’t want to!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, who had been leaning against my back, stepped forward and said to the King of the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What was that? A doll should not be so impertinent! Thy will doesn’t matter! I am―――― me! 【Giga Wind Cutter】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Corkscrew】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t stand hot-tempered bald old men… I’m so mad that I can’t stand it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does it mean so much to this guy that we’ve come this far?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t move ahead, Kron. Step back a little…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Back on the Surface…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I had Kron step back because she was in danger, she pulled on my arm, and smiled sadly next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me and Jamdi’el… we were telling you the same thing as the King of the King, weren’t we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment I had no idea what she was talking about. I mean, what are you saying at a time like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wanted your baby, so I asked you to take me. Jamdi’el also tried to force you and me together. But for you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What I felt just now when the Heavenly King said that to me… you were thinking that too, weren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No…… well, it’s not that I hate it that much… it’s just that men and women think differently about these things, and Kron is cute. I mean, I don’t care about that now… no, because it’s now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you understood me, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I… I won’t say anything like the King of the Heavens anymore. I want to have your child. I want to have a child with you… only when you feel the same… then we will be able to truly love our newborn child.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At times like this, it was really inappropriate, but we laughed at each other, it was kind of embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, that’s why…… let’s not only knock out that Heavenly King… but once he’s calm… can’t we talk calmly with him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was quite unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What art thou saying! Die, perish, vanish! Be gone from my sight!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were under the fury of the Heavenly King’s magic, and we didn’t have the luxury of time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, we don’t have that leeway! I mean, there’s no point in talking to that guy! Why would you do that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, you said, that it’s …… narrow-minded for that prince to try so hard just to get acknowledged by a father like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah … oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe that’s the case for you. For someone as strong and great as you. But somehow, I understand how the Prince feels.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic of the Heavenly King was being unleashed without a break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we were no longer in the palace, he was rampaging without any concern for damage to the buildings or the surroundings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the midst of this situation, Kron said that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than the Heavenly King, Kron spoke for the prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because I’m the same…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Same? How are you and the prince…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. Jamdi’el, to you… and the world outside of the Cacretale… and to the people of this world… she has done terrible things, hasn’t she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron said something like that about Jamdi’el, wistfully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what we talked about on the Surface as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An enemy of humanity. A Six Supremacy. And even here in the Heavenly world, she once did a lot of terrible things to her compatriots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the past of Jamdi’el that Kron did not know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still, I can’t hate Jamdi’el. I want to be acknowledged. I want to be praised. I want Jamdi’el to be … pleased with me. That’s what I want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I… I want to ask the King of the Heavens.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron was serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my perspective, I couldn’t help but think, “That guy’s sh*t, get rid of him right away”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, who had run away from home and now had Tre’ainar by my side, I would have thought, “I’m not that bothered if my father and family can’t recognize me”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Kron empathized with the Prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s a point in meddling on this. There’s a limit in how involved you can be in other’s family affairs. Beside, this crazy bastard’s too far gone to even try to have a talk with, it’s impossible, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You still want to do that? Talk to that old man? I asked Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong, perhaps not so unexpected?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That Heavenly King… tis not so much what he has gone through so far… rather… the proportion of side effects…… may be grand.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Unravel the truth, and you may certainly manage it. You may be able to reach his consciousness with Kron’s Daybreak Eye.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar spoke as if he were somewhat sure of what he was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With those words, he seemed to say, “the Heavenly King is not just crazy”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… th…… ou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, listening to Kron’s words, the prince lying on the floor raised his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pitifully, his eyes moistened with tears, a weak expression on his face. He looked like an abandoned dog…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… if you use your Daybreak Eye, it will do something… it seems…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It could… but… you, are you in a pity party?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you think we’re doing here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I said was not entirely wrong. This is nothing but meddling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn’t that right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. It means nothing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You see…… Tre’ainar too…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As such, you should get on with it and defeat that foolish king. We need not help this country, this world, this royalty, or anything else.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? You’re telling me, “that’s right”, but you’re somewhat testing me… and…… what’s tugging at my heart?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s words… and…… the Prince’s face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What is it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In my heart I ask Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’m not like my father. That’s why I don’t go on the path he wants me to go, and I have no obligation or duty to do the same thing he did.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then, dare I ask. What would my father do… in a situation like this?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis obvious. That single-celled idiot does not think――――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I knew that. I knew it even before I asked Tre’ainar for an answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure my father would say something like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll save them all. Leave it to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I can easily imagine the scene… and…… my father has the power to do it, so he would say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I suppose, it can actually be done.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not like my father, so I don’t have to do the same thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. There is no need for it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is there something that my father can do and I can’t?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apart from that, just because I don’t have to do something doesn’t mean I can’t do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So if I want to do it, I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu, tis easy to say anything with just your mouth.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I’ll prove it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…… Either way, it’s no use trying to seal his movements…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… when I take him down, do whatever you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Hmm … yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s all right, isn’t it? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can’t seem to do the same thing as your father, then how can you go beyond your father and become recognized by the world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can do it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So let’s do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
