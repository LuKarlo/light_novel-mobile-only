 “Well, I’ll be handing out the [Volunteer Warrior’s Notice] paper before everyone goes home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During the lesson, I spent my life training, and my mental energy rather than my body was greatly diminished.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lay down exhausted on the desk, but there was a piece of paper from the instructor in the class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It confirms the will of the Academy students in terms of their career path after graduation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, path… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. And this is delivered to the destination, and the organization of choice will send you notifications of interviews and the examinations.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are columns from No. 1 to No. 3 in the application form. If there is no employment up to the third level, it becomes a consultation again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You all know that it’s not an exaggeration to say that this will decide your future life. So seriously think of your choice before I submit it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, aspiring warriors decide our course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, the number one in popularity for aspiring warriors will naturally be 【Imperial Knights】, but last year’s pass rate was 20 times. Please think about that and decide. Well, I doubt the top five students will have to think about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, the 【Imperial Knight】 is truly a warrior’s flower. Higher salary than hunters and magicians.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, it is possible to rise to the ministerial class such as the aide of the king if promoted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, it’s no exaggeration to say that most of the academy’s students are aiming to be Imperial Knights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis quite a high acceptance rate. But…… However elite the lineage, you are but a soldier? Why is it so strict?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, that’s right… The war ended ten years ago and the world is peaceful. Because there are enough soldiers.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, I see… Not only the level decline, but also the sever disarmament… Tis the price of peace. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, in the days of war like in the past, the country’s budget was put into the military, and the Imperial Knights were being adopted more and more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not the times now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If peace comes, we will be able to focus on reconstruction and development, and the hiring of high-income imperial knights has become a narrow gate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it doesn’t matter to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By the way, what about the top five students earlier mentioned by the teacher’s man? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The top five members of the Academy are 【Imperial Knights】 almost unconditionally, without any recruitment exams, only interviews in the form of recommendations. Moreover, the assignment to the Career Group in the Imperial capital………… In other words, it means riding on the main line in the middle of the career path.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. The top five applicants will be prepared for the success course unconditionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, as second place I can ride the course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And…What path will you go?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hah? …… What to do…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was puzzled by Tre’ainar’s obvious question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever course…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So I’m second in my grade. Even if I don’t do anything, I’m still in a career group. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I was able to go on the road of success of the 【Imperial Knights】 as it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? You want to get ahead in life?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh…? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Assigned to Imperial capital… In other words, you seem rebellious with your father, but do you mean to end up drinking sweet juice in your father’s prestigious environment after all? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh… Wh-What? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eyes as if they were making a fool of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I saw his eyes, my heart roared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh-What are you saying… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No…Now that I mention it, I have yet to hear that kind of story. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What do you want to be an 【Imperial Knight】 for? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『From you, ‘I will protect this Imperial Capital and the peace’… never have I heard of anything fishy, like protecting the Emperor… Tis why I assumed that the purpose was simply to succeed in life… Unless… Is there something else you want to be for any reason? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You repel your father, if as an 【Imperial Knight】 the annoying public assessment you gained would continue to follow… If sweet juice and success are not the purpose…… Why become an Imperial Knight? Are your intentions truly there? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did I want to be an 【Imperial Knight】 in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was brought up in an environment where I had to be. No, do I have to? Wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because my father, my mother, and Sadiz have never told me to be an Imperial Knight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, I wanted to be an 【Imperial Knight】 like my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what about me now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, what are you going to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Imperial Knights, of course! I’m going to take the exams and interview preparation, and I’ll protect the Empire!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m applying to the Magic Institute. I want to study more.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… Well… After all, I can’t give up. We have to try!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My classmates are also talking about the volunteer warrior report handed to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Each of them is thinking a lot about the future. It’s a dream, it’s a goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s natural at this time of year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s the matter?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, oh…… Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me, there was a Phianse looking down with her arms folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… Nothing in particular…… out of the blue,…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right? Somehow, I’m worried that you’ve been neglecting your classes lately.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, it’s okay…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I hope so. Anyway, you need to be firm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Firm… I don’t…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Phianse just started talking to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. I think you know, I was in the Academy as part of my education, but I’m not going to be an Imperial Knight, Instead I’m going to study politics under my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, you’ll be at the top of the class. Do not be ashamed as our representative, I hope you will do well even in the capital.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I thought, ‘Why am I going to be an Imperial Knight?’, I couldn’t immediately respond to the princess, who had no doubt that I would become an imperial knight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Phianse is the princess of the Empire. Although she is the academy’s top student, she will never become a warrior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After graduation, she will certainly go on her way as a member of the royal family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s politics, and there’s a lot more to it, like marrying someone somewhere and securing a succession.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, the current emperor married in his teens, and that will not be far in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why as next in the class when we graduate, I’ll rank first in the class among the candidates for the Imperial Knights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In the capital… huh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, make a solid achievement in the capital, and eventually you will become Warrior Prime after your father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is, naturally what I appear to think, even those around me would think so, my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I-if that’s the case, everyone would agree… w-with me about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know. Even if I became a warrior… In the end, I’m not as good compared to my father… If I leave any achievement, as expected, he is the son of the hero ‘Hiro’, that’s it… That’s my life.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… Huh? What’s wrong… Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m still talking to Phianse, and I started to think a little bit, and gradually I felt like I could understand what Tre’ainar felt as he looked at me like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s boring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about my life from now on, I felt that way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, I haven’t thought about my life or the future, but every time I did, I was under the impression that ‘I had no choice’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for some reason, now I don’t think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more I think about it, the more I can’t think of a reason why I want to be an Imperial Knight, and I can’t think of what I want to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only thing that comes to mind is that I want to repulse what Tre’ainar said to me, the life of ‘drinking sweet juice in my father’s prestigious environment’.
</div>
