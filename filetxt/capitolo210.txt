 “Here we go! Breakthrough! 【Earth Misdirection Shuffle】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!? This brat… just shuffles about! I aaaaaam, emineeeeeeeeeent!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A measly trick… such disillusioned swaying… makes me more frustrated and hurts my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, the extent to which he darts about, there is no opportunity to cast great magick… no… I’m losing my focus… but ‘that’…I must ingest ‘that’… but if I try to do anything other than attack…

 “【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, 【Mega Wind Wall】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His fists fly. Even though blocked by the wall of wind, if not careful, even this wall will be pierced lightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Drat…… once again…… if only I… could take that again… nay! What am I thinking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heavenly King, try to catch me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I need not rely on such a thing for this lowly brat… I’m a king!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Mega Wind Cutter】! 【Mega Wind Cutter】! 【Mega Wind Cutter】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My blades of wind shall cut thee to shreds!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its power is inferior, but it fires continuously in exchange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He will not evade forever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… it’s getting rougher and rougher…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why! Why does that brat smile… is he mocking me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, don’t think thou can remain so flippant!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not flippant. I’m keeping my eyes open and… also sharpening my concentration…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He smiles, why? Those eyes. Is he plotting something… some goal? Concentration?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah…… I get it. The opponent’s blind spot… out of sight and thought… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, what is he? Talking to himself? Nay, it’s as if he talks with someone… nay, for me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s no concern of mine! I shall slice thee up and dispose of thee on the Surface! 【Mega Wind Cutter】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever thy plot, I shall crush you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if the brat moves about, just aim for that doll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, that brat stopped to protect the doll!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! Ah…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay, it’s not much magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s sturdy. But there’s damage to his legs and arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He will wander around no longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not yet! Stay down, Kron!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll take care of it! Because I can do it! So stay down till ‘the time’ comes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, thou talks with such a big mouth and have such eyes? Then more…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or rather, hey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your son is here too you bastard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Son? Of mine?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… guh… Daddy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… Come to think of it, he collapsed… art thou too injured to get involved?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, does thou still crawl in such a place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This foolish… failure! Unlike me, utterly useless! Nay!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Da… di…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Utterly deplorable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a foolish, failure…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s… is there really any point to talking with someone like this? Would you be happy if he recognized you? Well…… I’ll make a place for it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That brat again… on top of that…… that…… condescending look in his eyes… the way his eyes look down on my personage!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fools all of them, because they can’t understand me, they looked down on me… with such eyes…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This brat! To look down on me with such eyes! Who art thou showing such eyes to?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t think a man who looks at his kid like that should care about people’s eyes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Die…… along with all who are foolish enough to look down at――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why look at me with such eyes? Every last one of them. Everyone…… I, who am I ――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Phantom Punch】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… wh… at? Just now…… something…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shockwave version of the Phantom Punch”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The control to pierce through the eye of the needle and the little shockwave from my small swing, your wind magic became a blind spot that let me drive a hit in.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kah…… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something touched my jaw… the world is spinning… regardless of my will, my consciousness was almost lost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I punched him out, he’s not unconscious… but…… this is fine! Kron!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve been waiting! King of the Heavens! I’m stripping you naked! Magic Eye Skill, 【Tweet of Bygone Days】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, the eyes of that doll that came forward glowed and enveloped around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First of all, you will tell me. Tell us about yourself…… and how you came to be this way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at that moment, many things ran through my mind in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did I do this in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I, as a King and an apostle of God, only tried to fulfill my responsibilities.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Captain Dekte’ita. i, its useless… the traitor, Jamdi’el… is too strong…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Killed… we’re to be killed… we should never have come down to the Surface…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Even if we hide like this, it’s only a matter of time before she finds us…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do I remember this now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tch…… no choice…… we return to the country at once to rethink our strategy…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Even if I say to return… once the battle is set up, Jamdi’el will never allow our escape…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, that’s right. So…… thou must fight and buy time.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh!? What… w, will thou not fight with us?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I am not one to die here! A venerable nobleman of the Heavens… the value of life is different between thou and I! In the first place, will we all be annihilated here… will one of thee survive… or perhaps I shall survive… which do thou think is the best choice! I will make sure thy families are compensated! They will know that thou fought bravely to the end. Therefore, go forth in peace!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where did I go wrong? What is my life? Nay, I’m not wrong. I’ve lived a righteous life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter the sacrifice, I am the one who must not die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chosen of the Seraph tribe… the king’s hand… nay, a legitimate lineage even worthy of becoming King…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Say, did thou hear? The other day, the Jamdi’el subjugation operation.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Aye, apparently, he’s the sole survivor…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tch, the incompetent with only his family name… I’d rather even a single young soldier survives than him…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And yet he claims that he will one day become the Heavenly King?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ha, such conceit, even though that’s impossible.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what the incompetent petty citizens say, I will not be beaten.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My existence, the chosen of the elite, is heaviest of all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Thou know nothing… foolish… and pathetic… most of all, thou remain ignorant of that…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… there was only one person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I often receive their cheeky tongue… she was the only one from whom I allowed it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Thou still aims to be a King, then I’ll show thee how tiny thou art…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was a strict woman. Should I make any folly, she slapped me on the cheek.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But whether I’m wrong or not, she was the woman who saw me as I am… so I allowed it… and, gradually we changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Lord Dekte’ita… thy wife is in considerable danger. Even if she gives birth to the child, the mother’s body is…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu… then…… do I abandon the child? At last, a life born between I and my wife… a Seraph woman can only bear a child once in her lifetime…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But not at the cost of her life. After all, the child in her womb… it bears the Heraldic Eye. Therefore, all her magickal power will flow to the child. However, if thou acts now…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「… Ku… That’s right… for my wife’s life… I’m sorry… my child… I’m sorry, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For my wife, who was frail to begin with, childbirth was far more severe than we had imagined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was particularly life-threatening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was determined to save my wife’s life, so I tried to pour magick into the child in her womb and abort the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, my wife squeezed her lifeforce and repelled my magick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nay… absolutely not…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, my wife was the very definition of a mother protecting her child at the risk of her own life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What… art thou so intent on this birth?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Yes…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, th… then give birth! In exchange, I will not tolerate failure! Thou must give birth! No matter what, thou will give birth to our child! A child born of us! Without a doubt, thou should be the bearer of the future of the Seraphs!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… that day… I saw… one life was lost, but I saw a new life sprouting… yes… life is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Was life always so heavy… or is it just me… this life… of mine… should I have survived …… in exchange for those who once had a future …… sacrificed for me? Nay. I never even realized… such a needles life…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I reconsidered the weight of the lives I once abandoned… so……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Jamdi’el, I… I shall subdue Jamdi’el! I shall take responsibility for my actions! To avenge those who sacrificed for me… I will…… avenge them, I will…… avenge them! Even at the cost of my life, I will defeat Jamdi’el and the King of the Demons who drew her in!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really meant to fight… even die for it… the moment I held my newborn child, I knew the weight of the life I once abandoned, and for that purpose… however……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Hence forth, the subjugation of Jamdi’el and interference with the Surface is forbidden. No longer can we allow any more victims. All for the sake of the peace of the Heavenly world. The kingdom will also be moved, drifting in the skies where Jamdi’el and her ilk cannot interfere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the decision of the predecessor king.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surely you jest… then how can the souls of the dead attain peace?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Thou disobeyed the King’s decree? Dekte’ita. However noble thou may be, this cannot be overlooked. Therefore, thou will be imprisoned. Brace thyself for hundreds of years of imprisonment?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I didn’t know anything… until I lost something irretrievable… and when I tried to act at least to at least make amends, I was condemned again… so what should I have done?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What should I do……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Congratulations on your release… Daddy…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu? Art thou… Ga’al?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the time I got out of confinement, I was perplexed by the sight of my own child, who had grown up so differently, and at the same time I felt inferior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although neither his mother nor his father was by his side, Ga’al had grown up strong. In fact, unlike me, he was adored, recognized, and admired by people all over the country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had the brains, the strength, and the talent of his Heraldic Eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he smiles at me, I only feel pity for myself and wonder if I am being looked down upon by my own child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have no dignity as a father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is only natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was imprisoned, this Heavenly world was at peace, and moreover, the Demon King’s Army, to which Jamdi’el belonged, had been destroyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What in Heavens am I to do…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hihahahaha, you did nothing wrong. You are really the chosen one. It’s everyone else who is stupid enough not to know it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… was that the moment? It was when I met the wandering traveler who suddenly emerged from the Surface world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What do thou say? My life is full of mistakes and meaningless… I’ve done many irreparable things… I can’t even properly face my child because I feel as if he looks down on me.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nope. The wrong ones are the Heavenly King and the Seraphs too stupid to realize it. Your potential is different from other Seraphs. Even if you don’t have a magic eye, you will not be outdone by your kid. If that potential is awakened, it will surpass even Jamdi’el… so you didn’t do anything wrong. You are the one Seraph who should survive at all costs.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Potential? What nonsense? As if there is any such thing in me… even if I know such a thing now, generally… I don’t need that kind of power anymore, do I? The Demon King’s army has fallen, hasn’t it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But Jamdi’el isn’t dead. She’s alive. Have the last few hundred years been peaceful? How can you be sure that the next hundred years will remain peaceful? there is nothing more frightening than a Jamdi’el who has lost her Lord and fallen into despair. Even if she’s just hiding now, she’s bound to come out into the open sooner or later.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nu…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Right now, it is not fully grown, but… when the next king is raised, Jamdi’el will surely rise again to have that king take the world. And once they destroy the Surface, that madness will naturally turn to the Heavens.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can do nothing… not even talk straight with my own child… before me, who lived quietly in hiding, with nothing to do and no one to talk to, interact with, or engage with… appeared this man who became familiar with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t talked to anyone that much in a long time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Besides, if the war between the Surface world and the Demon Realm is over, don’t you think the humans will come for the Heavens next anyway? Those are the ones who defeated Jamdi’el and the Great Demon King Tre’ainar. A threat stronger than the two… don’t you think?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then you will be the king and protect everything. A coup… no…… it’s a crusade. I fully support you. You see, we’re best friends, aren’t we?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the man was a blabbermouth, but for some reason I listened to his words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Here… I’ll give you this potion and needle.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What? What is… this potion? And this needle?」
</div>
