<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The barrier around Cacretale, which had prevented any contact in the past few months, had been lifted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth may be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Jamdi’el may have something to do with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just thinking about it, how many times I had considered forcefully breaking the barrier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wasn’t allowed to do that, and for the last three months all Mamu and I could do was pray.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But those days are finally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As I have mentioned before, in order to reach Cacretale, you must negotiate for entry through the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bethreal. There is also a pre-application inspection which will include the purpose of travel, the number of people entering the country, the size of the ship to be anchored, the duration of stay, and even restrictions on weapons and magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rumor has it that the civil war has been intense in recent years, so the immigration process may have to be very strict. Along with that, you will also have to pay an entry fee to Cacretale and even an intermediary fee to the Kingdom of Bethreal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Furthermore, if you wish to go to Cacretale by sea, you must notify the Navy Admiral of the ‘Kingdom of Zengeva’, which claims the waters in that area as its territorial waters.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s grave, Lord Hiro! The Kingdom of Betrayal applied for entry to Cacretale immediately after the boundary fell, but it seems that the contact point has changed due to the victory of the opposition, and it seems that they are currently trying to communicate with the new contact point, but they can’t seem to make contact at all… something may have happened!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We couldn’t just fly in, ignoring the procedure, even though our beloved son might be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We can’t get you into Cacretale!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fell down with my head in my hands at the sound of that voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cacretale, a secluded nation that has been out of contact for the past three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Empire, which is also a member of the Union, is strictly prohibited from interfering with or landing on Cacretale without permission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t do anything about it, but it was only the other day that the barrier finally came down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had been preparing for the application procedure for the last three months, so I thought it would go through right away, but in the end it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lord Hiro, we’ve got trouble! The princess we brought back to the Imperial City… Rebal… Fu … and the daughter of the Paiper family, the Ninja Warrior of Japone… the five of them disappeared. According to the report, there is an operational method of Space Transfer Magic in Fu Meday’s room… possibly mastered in the last three months…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems while we adults were idly lounging around, the next generation quickly moved by skipping the bothersome stuff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was dazzled by it and felt sorry for myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… this is the only way to go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really. It’s been a long time since we’ve gone on a date. On the ocean, on a boat, just flirting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then we drifted off and got lost. What a mess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, do I see an island over there? Are we saved?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooh, that’s right. We’re gonna make it. Let’s go for the time being.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the barrier was down, this is the only option.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mamu and I rowed a small boat from a spot far from Cacretale and arrived by chance, like castaways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, this was kept secret from the Union, Old man Mikado, and the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, it’s our responsibility. Well, if anything happens to us, we’ll probably be fired…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… when I was a kid… I was annoyed by the rules that adults decided and bound, so I always lost my temper and broke those rules. I remember Old man Mikado would get mad at me every time I did that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. At that time, I thought that if I quickly grew up and became a big shot, then I could do anything I wanted…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! I can’t do anything now… what am I doing … really.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As we rowed the small boat, I lamented our own pettiness with Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It took us this long just to go to our missing son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s all my fault.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s mine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s my fault! I’ve been neglecting him all this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And so did I! In the first place… I should have just quit my job and been a mother… not push everything to Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘You weren’t in a position to quit easily either. It can’t be helped. I’m still the father and it’s my responsibility.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many times have we had this exchange in the last three months?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’re both blaming ourselves, and repeating things that don’t make any sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But after all it’s me, I… if I had caught him in Cantidan! If only I had noticed Jamdi’el’s approach!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm……well…that is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s just, that woman is basically a mass of madness full of disastrous air and you didn’t notice she was approaching until the last minute…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! I, if you’re going to say that, then why did you go out of the Imperial City with your head held high, saying, ‘No matter what, I’ll find Earth!’ only to leave the Imperial City, and go to Inai City, in a completely different direction?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in other words, no matter how many times we’ve talked over the past three months, all we’ve been able to say to each other is that we’re both idiots and unfit to be parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s no way to make up for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But so what do we do now? Give up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the one thing I couldn’t do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if Earth doesn’t recognize us as parents anymore…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Finally… we arrived. So this is Cacretale.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With these thoughts in mind, Mamu and I finally reached the shoreline of Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been to various countries so far, but this was my first time landing here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were no buildings or people on the beach, but the first thing that caught my attention was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s so devastated.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. It’s like something fought… and was destroyed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Desolate coastlines and vegetation. It wasn’t like that originally, and it was obviously broken by someone’s hand, it was rough, and there were holes everywhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if there was a fierce battle…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s some residual magic, and it’s a rather large one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe there is a living area over there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going on? For now… I don’t feel like they’re fighting, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a civil war for a while, and there was information that it ended recently, but it seems that something has happened in the past few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s a lot of people, huh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. That’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The glances and the signs of people looking our way. Their power may not be that big a deal, but they’re clearly wary of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, from their point of view, we may be intruders, and I suppose it’s natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now …… we may manage to pose as harmless drifters and get some information…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who are you people? What are you doing in this country?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before we could say anything, the people who were hiding appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dozens appeared in a swarm, some young, some old, and some women who appeared to be sisters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were all hostile, pointing to us with brooms, axes, kitchen knives, and other everyday items as weapons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But none of them look like warriors or soldiers of this country, but civilians.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This country does not tolerate unauthorized entry from the outside!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, a man talked to us as their representative. Still a kid? Is he about Earth’s age?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa! If you attack this country, we’ll show you no mercy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This country, is ours to protect!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, please don’t be a dangerous person…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They all set themselves up for us, but they don’t have much strength… but, “these four” brothers… they seemed to be training a little bit…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey… Mortriage … they don’t look like bad people, but… what do you think?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know, but now without the High Priestess or Goddess… and the country is in this situation… we can’t just let outsiders in without permission.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, neither I nor Mamu carried any visible weapons. We were ready to take them out at any time, though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why we don’t give off the vibe of pirates or some other country that has come to attack, so the people who surrounded us seemed a little confused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sisters and the elderly were consulting with young people as if they were a little troubled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa! You don’t know if it’s an enemy or not, right? Maybe they are trying to catch us off guard! After all, those Seraphs messed up our country like that! I won’t let that happen again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the brawny brother violently raised a loud voice, but what he said was quite righteous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew something was up. Does it have anything to do with the barrier coming down?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, Seraphs…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At least we can’t let anyone in now! I promised Earth! He said he’d leave it to us while he was away! That’s why we’re going to protect this country while they’re gone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seraphs? Don’t tell me it’s Jamdi’el… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, Hiro… he…… just now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment I thought I had misheard him, but there was no mistaking it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He just said “Earth”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait wait, hey, you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, what!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That, now, you just said Earth… as in Earth Lagann!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… eh you… how the hell do you know our friend …… Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, not only the energetic fellows, but also other people and sister-like women looked surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, friend?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mamu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I knew it… I knew it, Earth is here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, there was no doubt. Earth is in this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so happy that I almost cried, and Mamu and I shouted with that feeling in our heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m Hiro Lagann! Earth’s father!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m Mamu Lagann! Earth’s mother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What right did we have to say that? But we had no choice but to shout that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eeehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if Earth doesn’t accept us…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””There is no way that’s true?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”…… Eh?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I didn’t think that we wouldn’t be accepted even by the people I met for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They looked astonished at what we said, and immediately shouted that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How the heck are you Earth’s father and mother? He’s the same age as us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then how could his parents be that young!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s parents? That man’s parents are still…can’t be.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, that girl… isn’t she younger than us?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! You’re much better off claiming to be Earth’s sister!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t be fooled by such an obvious lie!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Mamu and I were stunned and smiled bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because in the Imperial City, there was no one who didn’t know us as parents and child, so I’ve never been told that we don’t look like parents and child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… ahahaha, I wonder why I still look so young? Well, I’m an eternal teen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… your bust hasn’t changed for more than a decade…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!? Hey, when I gave birth to Earth, they swelled up a little!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But they deflated quickly… no, when Earth was a baby, you were always crying about it… and your breasts were overtaken by Sadiz when she was about ten years old―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up, you idiot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, it took me a while to get people to believe me and Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, the city was shining yesterday. Yes, December 24th was the historic day when Apollo 8 flew around the moon for the first time in the world, and broadcast the image of the moon live to Earth. I suppose everyone was excited to remember that day forever. Yesterday I was celebrating such a historic day by biting on fried chicken alone at home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And today, when I woke up, fried chicken bones and an empty beer can were lying on my bedside…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, illustrations of the parents and Sadiz… Ph…… Phi? Phia… the princess has already been published, and I will put it here. Scroll down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
