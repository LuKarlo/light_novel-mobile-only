 The memories of the Heavenly King flowed into my brain through Kron’s magic eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was wondering if there was a lot going on with this guy, but in the middle of the memory, Tre’ainar suddenly looked surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a man who appeared in the middle of the Heavenly King’s memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man had no wings like the Seraph tribe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, he was not human either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that… the man who appeared in the memory…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had long brown hair, his bangs all flowing backwards, and his “pointed ears” had many piercings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Light green skin. Flashy glasses with the lens painted yellow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiahahahah, Good day to you all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A mysterious man in flashy rainbow-colored clothing wearing a dreadful necklace with a skull at the center of the cross on the neck. No, a demon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My friend… why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo. Well, that, uh… who are you again?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… what art thou saying? It is I!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, sorry, I’ve a habit of forgetting those who I don’t care for… well, no matter, baldy. Thanks for the help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wha, eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve harvested all the ‘flower beds’ that I grew in this sky, and I’ve had enough of this place, so I’m leaving.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The person who appeared laughing with a frivolous salute was the same demon that appeared in the memory of the Heavenly King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The King of the Heavens called that person a friend, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While crawling on the floor, the prince also had a troubled face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Paripi…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Huh? Somehow, Tre’ainar muttered… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What was that? I’m wondering why there’s a demon here, but that name… oh? It’s a name I’ve heard before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the name of a legend that used to appear in picture books or horror ghost stories…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This man… was alive…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, to be clear, Tre’ainar seemed more surprised than when Jamdi’el first appeared before me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With his eyes wide open and clearly upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar…… this guy…?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked her in our minds, Tre’ainar huffed and looked at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This man… once renowned as the chief military strategist of the Demon King’s army… one of the Six Supremacy who once made a name for himself as a warrior … ‘The Black Sage, Paripi’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Th, The Black Sage, Paripi!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『O, oi, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I know the name! Paripi? That’s a legend on par with Jamdi’el!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Hey, Earth. Do you know this person?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Ah, eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s face was furrowed when he heard my unintentionally mouthing and exclamation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both the Heavenly King and the prince look at me with surprised faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I know only that name, though I have never met him before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Paripi himself who heard my words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, so overjoyed panay! Thank you! I’m really honored that the new generation knows about me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He smiled at me with an exaggerated reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looks so frivolous and irritating, but when I think that he is that same Paripi, every word he says and every movement he makes looks creepy and scary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tch…… this man… no, there was no corpse to be found, so it was never impossible… by no means, yet here we are… here…… in this place…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did Tre’ainar looks somewhat chagrined beside me? It seemed he was gnashing his teeth with that expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, the Six Supremacy were your former subordinates, right? In other words, that’s a comrade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was like that, but somehow we lived together under the same roof for three months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he is the same the Six Supremacy as Jamdi’el, this guy is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Do not put this one together with Jamdi’el.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar advised me, as if to say I was being “naive”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fine! An absolute with this man… ‘perhaps he is a decent fellow’ is a misconception, is it not? This man is willing to commit cruel and malicious deeds for the sake of amusement that would nauseate and sicken the normal mind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Tre’ainar’s advice reminded me of an old tale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember when I was a kid, Sadiz used to harass me by my bedside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― If you misbehave, I’ll terrorize you at the Paripi banquet
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, I’m glad you know me, but don’t give me that frightened look, Earth Lagann, okay? You’re a man with a more fearless and raging soul, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, a happy-go-lucky Paripi, slowly approached me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you know me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jamdi’el knew of you as well. Perhaps you have surprisingly gained fame for that graduation match. Do not get swallowed in, child! This man skillfully tries to round up his opponents by leading them on with words!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, more than any other time, Tre’ainar warned me in a flustered manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For this man, that’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Child, Paripi smiled… his focus is… not the child…! Protect Kron, child! He is aiming for Kron!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar shouted so, and Paripi looked at me smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nice to meet you, Earth Lagann, I’m formerly of the Demon King Army, but now I’m a man who just plays around without getting a regular job. Call me Paripi the Vagabond. Ah, I’m glad I met you too, Miss Kron, and my what nice eyeballs!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The demon’s right hand was stretched out towards Kron’s eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good thing I stayed in the breakthrough state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was able to repel the wrist of the demon’s extended arm from the side just in time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron sat up, eyes fluttering at the sudden event.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, what if my reaction was delayed by even a few seconds? What if I hadn’t heard Tre’ainar’s voice? In fact, I couldn’t react without Tre’ainar telling me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without any warning, he suddenly tried to take Kron’s Daybreak Eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally…… would you suddenly try to steal the eyeball of the woman you just met? No, even if you’re not meeting for the first time, you wouldn’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hyuu… I was completely caught in the act … in fact, your consciousness didn’t fully predict my actions… but, good job preventing it… I was a little surprised.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You bastard… suddenly, what the hell did you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, but still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I repelled the arm, and while whistling and looking impressed with me, he suddenly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unlike Big Sis, I have a bad habit of not being concerned about the details. Whoa, who did you learn the techniques of the Great Demon from?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unless you had the Heraldic Eye like Big Sis, you could not have used the breakthrough, let alone the Great Spiral.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And how… did you know I was Paripi? It’s true that I could be a picture book… but, my clothes have changed since the war, and I’m wearing sunglasses now. I’m sure no one but the generation at that time, or my friends back then, would recognize me as Paripi at a glance… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I felt an oppressive chill. It was as intense as Jamdi’el’s black miasma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t see his eyes with those strange glasses, but what kind of eyes does he have behind them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh… who knows…… I wonder why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you can’t tell me something you never told your dad or mom, right? So…… I thought that if I get Kron’s eyeball and look into your memory, then I will know. Tehepero!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His tone was calmly jokey, but this guy had a persuasive power which makes me think he’s serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, don’t give that look, Earth. Yeah, do you smoke? I have good cigarettes, but how about getting closer? That’s cool~, bad boy! How about a little rebellion against dad and mom? Now, I’ll give you a pack for free. If you smoke it and embrace a woman, it’ll feel so nice that you can go to heaven, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah… I see…… it all finally makes sense. In the meantime, accept nothing from this one, child. Most likely… tis not cigarettes… but ‘herbs’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, there’s no doubt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, this is one of the Legendary Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, I received the spirit in the name of review. I’m sorry I didn’t notice it, but the tension went up. Thank you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
