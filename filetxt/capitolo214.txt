 Damn it, my body’s numb. I can’t move properly. I can’t even put any strength into my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was told to be careful of poison, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daddy! Da … ah … Daddy!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kah, ah… uh, ah, gah, gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the King of the Heavens, whose belly was blown off just to attack me with poison, was convulsing and gushing blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron also couldn’t even sit up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is bad. Such a……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not much poison, but can you do detoxification magic?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No… maybe if it’s simple, but I can’t put in any magic right now…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Neurotoxin… trembling lips and this discoloration… perhaps a Dendrotoxin strain…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’m sorry… even if I’m told what the poison is…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tch, tis why that academy is currently lacking! To not even cover survival training… tis essential to carry such knowledge and a serum… no, even I did not give that guidance at my blunder… kuh…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also biting his teeth with regret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not good enough…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, kid? How are you feeling? Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Impact on my back? I’m getting my back stomped on by Paripi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y,ou bast… ard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahahaha, you have cheeky eyes. But that’s ignorance, not bravery. If you know me, you wouldn’t look at me like that. On the battlefield, I’ve hollowed out the eyeballs, and cut off ears.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, you’re still too noisy, so why don’t you try another one? Here! There goes! There goes ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, gaaaaaahhh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, that’s it! But … you seem to know me, but you don’t know at all… what does that mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy, my body, his claws calmly like playing the piano… over and over, it hurts!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, what to do? Cut off your limbs as well as your eyes and ears, skin you alive and deliver you to Hiro and Mamu… or have you drugged up and broken? Sell you off to a perverse male brothel? Not good…… I’m drawing a blank and can’t come up with any good ideas.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Horrifying… but in his case, it’s not a threat. He’ll really do it. No, that’s the kind of stuff he does.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if Tre’ainar doesn’t tell me, I know that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His monologue wasn’t just to scare me, but when he says he’ll do it, he really will… this guy……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But first. I have to get the eyeballs from here… Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth won’t tell me, so I must take a peek. Earth… what is he hiding… is there someone behind him… ooh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, of course, that madness went all the way to Kron. Oh no, Kron can’t move either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, can you read my memory? Then, can we talk? No, it’s no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “won’t let… have…… my, eyes… you…… won’t, let.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It doesn’t matter what you want. I’ll decide.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, he’s trying to get Kron’s eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, Boss Hakuki and Sis Jamdi’el have done something fascinating… and it’s such a big deal because it expresses the Daybreak Eye so faithfully.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… ah… tsu…… gah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was made only with genetic information obtained from the hair of the Great Demon King, and grew up to this point…… but isn’t this much enough? After all, it is a doll made halfway. Not as long-lived as we pure demons. It’s just like humans, with less than a hundred years of life. Even if it dies here and now, it wouldn’t make much difference, would it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron bit her lips with her motionless body, tears in her eyes, and still glared at Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no. Kron can’t do anything either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this rate… at this rate…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, don’t mind if I… hn?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Flash step!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, at that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, someone appeared behind Paripi and tried to slash his neck with a knife.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oops… oh, my my… close one~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although he seemed to be in a comical mood, Paripi flew high with an agile movement and avoided it just in time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, looking down, he saw…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you doing to Honey and my friends? Wind Arts, 【Frenzied Kamaitachi】!’ “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s Shinobu! Shinobu, who was fighting the cloud golems in the square, saved Kron and attacked Paripi with sharp flying wind blades.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, no effect, it’s such a breeze!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the countless blades of wind were easily crushed by Paripi, who swung the claws of both hands in the air. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, if a breeze won’t do, what about the storm of ragging attacks?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Ah? … oh my?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the next moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Horizontal Chop】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Howachaaaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial Sword, 【Crimson Lotus Scorching Slash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial Spear, 【Marked Phantom Lance】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Mega Fire】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was truly a simultaneous attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Ororororooooooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Caught up in the unleashed raging storm, Paripi was violently blown away and struck against the wall with a violent impact, which broke down parts of the wall and ceiling and buried him under a pile of rubble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess! Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess! Big brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L, Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah~, it’s okay!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Goddess ah, Earth uh, we’re here!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After the storm, a cry of concern for me and Kron resounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everybody…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, Kron… it’s all right now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sad…… iz… how…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All of a sudden, the countless golems that were flocking to us disappeared, so we rushed here in a hurry. It looked like you were in a pinch, so for the time being, everyone attacked the demon that seemed to be a threat … that’s what it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Golems? Oh, yeah… because, the Heavenly King is in that state, so…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, it’s terrible… a poison…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, ah… but, before me… get to Kron quick…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, Little man has more wounds… we’ll have to hurry―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Sadiz looked at my wounds and made a bitter face as she nursed me, but then Shinobu, who appeared beside me, snatched me away from Sadiz, brought her lips to my wound, then made a kissing sound and then sucked on it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey! Eh… it’s poison, I’ll suck it out… Ju … Pe … Chu … Pe!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is snake venom… a sort of Dendrotoxin. But it’s okay. I’ll detoxify it right away. Don’t worry. I always carry antidotes and serum with me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s part of being a wife. How about it? Are you falling in love with me a little bit?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu showed off a smile on her face to reassure me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was somewhat relieved by her confident expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu… can you tell what kind of poison it is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. I think it’s a poison that’s unfamiliar in the Empire, but rest assured. It’s common in Japone. Leave Honey to me, you take care of her.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I understand. Please, take care of Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I see… then, with a face that looked a little conflicted, Sadiz left me with Shinobu and rushed to Kron… something, chuchu … no, this is a treatment, but… I’m kind of embarrassed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be shy, Honey. This is therapy. It is not a hickey or a marking, so don’t worry. I don’t want to make you mine, I want to be yours. So, whenever you feel like it, do whatever you like with kisses or markings on every corner of my body ♡.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unununu. L, l, l, let me suck out the poison myself…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That princess… Little man is in crisis, so let’s read the mood. Please go help Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The knowledge is outdated. Poison spreads instantly throughout the body, so tis impossible to suck out orally, and tis of little use. Rather, the risk of infection is higher… after all, ninjas are archaic… well, they carry medical packs at least.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s somewhat noisy, and Tre’ainar was a bit flustered a while ago, but he seemed calm and looked at Shinobu with cold eyes. No, even if you look at her with such eyes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But soon, Tre’ainar changed his gaze…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For now, child, you should be able to move soon. The number of people has increased, but… it grants little comfort, does it not? That man…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar looked in the direction in which Paripi was blown away with a serious expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. The opponent is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~… so annoying. The one coat I had left before setting off got covered with dust and a little ripped… how unpleasant Panay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, Paripi stood up from under the rubble as if nothing had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His clothes were slightly torn, but after being attacked by so many people, he doesn’t have much damage. Rather……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Standing up? After all our attacks…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe it… must have been a direct hit…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? This monster is… Earth, who is this demon?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s evil… also…… terribly strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, the air was heavy and a piercing, intense murderous aura was blown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahahaha… oh my… such a crowd… guests that I didn’t invite to my party, raiding it on their own… I’m so pissed off… Hi… Hihahaha … ha ~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone in the room, even Mr. Machio and Sadiz, had sweat running down their cheeks at the murderous atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Paripi looked at all of us…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, aren’t you too relaxed, damn brats! How could I get up? Unbelievable! You punks think you’ve seen the world! The eras we’ve lived through! The enemies we’ve fought are of a different dimension!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was not in the frivolous tone of voice which he had before, nor in the quiet, drunken tone of voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was shouting wildly as if he had lost his temper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s overflowing with anger from his whole body, wearing it and poised for us …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fine, small fries! Let’s give these kids a little old-fashioned hell to commemorate my departure from the land of the skies! Come now, all together! Hihahahahahahahahahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He shouted that he would take us all on by himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am indebted to you. This will be the last post of the year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for 2019.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I started this work in May of this year, and it was the first time that I was a contributor, and I was able to get a response from the audience, and I was able to experience publishing books, releasing books, and making comicalization decisions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is thanks to everyone who has been with us for more than 200 chapters, even though there are developments that got boring and dull along the way. Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the future, I may want to write a new work, or may be busy with my main business and marriage, and I do not know what will happen in 2020, but I would be grateful if we could keep in touch again next year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have a nice year, everyone!
