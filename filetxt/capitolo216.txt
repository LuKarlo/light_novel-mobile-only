 “Haaaaahh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whether it was the missing body parts or the poison, Mr. Machio recovered with his ability, and then gained a sturdier body and more antibodies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha Super Magical Recovery. That’s a very rear body panay. First time I’m seeing it since Gouda.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Arcane True Zenith Spear Tackle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you specialize only in physical strength, your skills can’t keep up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi who avoided the tackle from Mr. Machio’s strong dash with a flutter and doesn’t even let it touch him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that much power in front of him, he’s not in the zone like me, but he avoided it with ease.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll show you my skills.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maid Killer Arts, 【Table Manners】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when Sadiz moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aiming at Paripi as he avoided Mr. Machio’s attack, she threw a sharp-edged fork, a polished knife, and a plate like chakram all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, too easy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi easily knocked off all such things, bare hands and sharp claws.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, at that moment, Sadiz suddenly closed the distance with Parisi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dual Death Scythe…… 【Executioner Flash】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oho, o, ooooh!? So fast…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A high-speed rush that made her two heavy Scythes become invisible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was trying to chop off all the opponent’s limbs and head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was so serious that she tried to kill and injure her opponent without hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You evaded even this… but!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terra Spell――“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 【Mega Sandlock】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With both hands holding a weapon, Sadiz cast a magic spell. The next moment, sand appeared from Paripi’s feet, which suddenly wrapped around and restrained him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? No way … magic from the feet!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi seemed to be surprised at this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never seen it before either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, you cast spells with magic released from the palm, or by touching the ground to activate it, but from the foot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terra Attribute, Thunder Attribute, Composite Spell! 【Mega Landmine】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, this hurts! Ugh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, Sadiz’s attack never stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Paripi restrained in the sand, thunder blew through his body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kah. sh*t… I’m… damn… damn it… damn iiiiiiiit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is…… effective? Paripi was taking damage!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s over! I’ll take your head! My Deathblow… Original Secret Technique!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s here! Sadiz’ special move. When I was little, she showed it only once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a forward-leaning position, she pulled the scythes back, and swung out as she jumped in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Unwise! Paripi is acting! Tis a bluff!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Stop the maid, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar screamed as if he had panicked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Maid Slash】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, it’s a trap! Don’t jump in!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damnit! Damnit! …Just kidding ♡”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heigh-ho!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, fresh blood splattered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the blood that splattered from Sadiz’s scythe hitting Paripi’s right shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Sadiz!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, Sadiz’s left shoulder was also pierced by five claws “shot” from Paripi’s finger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~, you saved yourself by not stepping in as quickly as you should have. You should thank the little guy. If you had taken one more step… my claws would have pierced your heart.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, s, such underhanded conduct…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Could he send those claws flying like a throwing knife?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no, poison!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re still strong, though. You could have made a name for yourself in the war at the time, with the power you have now. As expected of you, the one raised by Hiro and Mamu, and reported as one of the key figures in the Empire.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, y… you bastard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, you didn’t notice my lure, and misunderstood it as a chance only to rush into it like a fool and eat a counterattack, your experience in actual battles is meager. Well, you choose to flirt with your cute young master rather than fight real battles, that’s the extent of it. And you are so pathetic that even your beloved Little man ran away from you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After being poisoned, Sadiz got down on one knee… no way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sh, shut up! Detoxification Spell, 【Mega Detox】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz stood up to her feet while detoxifying herself and whipping her body that was being eroded by poison.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, her body did not recover immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like a nightmare.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never seen Sadiz fighting seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I’ve never seen the bottom of Sadiz’s power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahhh! Imperial Dual Scythe Style!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz was brandishing her weapons with a serious look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooooh, 【Arcane True Zenith Knuckle Arrow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like Sadiz, Mr. Machio screamed, and seriously hit him with his swollen muscles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike Sadiz, I know the power of Mr. Machio’s serious punches because we clashed in the tournament with our all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You did a good job just now! Fire Release, 【Flame Kunai, 100 Consecutive Blows】!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu threw countless kunai covered in flames.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was aiming to toss the opponent with a number of techniques that are not well known on the Surface, and then slit his throat from behind whenever there was a chance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those three…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, just too easy, damn brats!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””tsu!?”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s get ripped apart… 【Wicked Funeral Claw Melody】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were torn and knocked down by the demon’s claws, and then everyone danced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were made to crawl in front of a single demon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiha, ♪ but, that’s some backbone, well, for small fries…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… I was a little bit excited, but I guess I’m getting bored.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t underestimate the Six Supremacy, but this much?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without disrupting his breath, without much damage, he scattered the strong men who gathered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe it… what is… this monster…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s a little too strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I never thought there was someone like this …… in the world… what should I do~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “M, my legs are cowering… I can’t move…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, s, scary, I’m scared… this is bad, bad bad,”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first there were dozens of us, but before long, the only ones standing here were the princess, who had already taken a lot of damage from his attack and got up while her clothes were in tatters, me and Kron, who were finally able to move our bodies, Elder sis Tsukshi and Karui, who were huddled together, and Hilua, who was trembling and frozen in the corner of the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, hah~… who the hell… is he…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “M, my magic… doesn’t work at all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Likewise, Rebal and Fu haven’t lost consciousness, but have been hurt more than necessary by his hands and haven’t yet risen from their knees.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We, who were more or less confident in our strength, couldn’t do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. Just who the heck… is this guy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As she approached, the princess asked me because they still didn’t know who he was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone except me and Kron wants to know the answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that guy… I glanced at Paripi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He is… one of the Legendary Six Supremacy and Generals of the former Demon King Army…’The Black Sage, Paripi'”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Elder sis Tsukshi and Karui, who knew nothing about the world outside of their secluded nation, only tilted their heads, but the expressions of the princess, Rebal, and Fu changed to one of astonishment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, wh … whaaat?! A Six Supremacy and General of the Demon King Army!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ridiculous, what are you saying, Earth! You think he is a Six Supremacy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, besides, I thought The Black Sage was dead…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They would never have dreamed that the opponent they were fighting against was a Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, they are small fish, but they seem to have excellent grades. Do you know of me? No, it’s embarrassing for me, I’ve got social anxiety.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi laughed in such a playful manner, irritating me, but no one was able to make any comment about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But the grades are only excellent on paper. If you don’t have much experience in actual combat, this is the limit. Your folks were already fighting us when they were your age.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to make fun of… no, I guess he’s actually making fun of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was saying that we were “just this much”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, much to my chagrin, I knew what the guy will say next.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After all, compared to our time―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… the current generation just aren’t as reliable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It seems… that’s what you want to say, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Pfft, hihaha.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those who lived in the old days of war always say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that my words were correct, and Paripi laughed again gleefully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. In fact, I’m supposed to have been killed by the parents of those two there, the Sword Saint and the Great Mage… but, their children are so weak that it would be ridiculous to take revenge. That’s right, Panay, not reliable, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal and Fu cannot say anything back, even though they have regrettable expressions at Paripi’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And of course……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know a lot about you… so the first thing I was disappointed with was…… the son of Hiro and Mamu, the bloodline I had expectations of, being so hopelessly second-rate…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu… wh, nh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it wasn’t just me, everyone thought so, didn’t they? The imperial family, the nobles, the warriors, the commoner pigs… of course…… Hiro and Mamu… and even the guys next to you right now. The other second generation are pampered with high praises, but your evaluation seems to have been scathing. A good-for-nothing flop.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This assessment of me. I never thought I’d hear the same thing again in this place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be silly! I don’t think of Earth like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Earth has been leading us since we were little… has been our center…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t speak like you know anything about Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess said, “That’s not true,” to Paripi’s words, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, it’s even worse because none of you knew what Earth thought of you and the voices around him, and you didn’t realize it. If you’re aware of it even a little, if you cared, Earth wouldn’t have left the Imperial City. In the first place, you guys who should have been together all along… especially you, princess? You don’t even know how Earth was able to ‘use that technique’, so what’s with all that pompous talk?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They are shocked at the words Paripi fluently uttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tch, what’s going on now? What’s with that face… sh*t…… I’m me, too… now I can’t help feeling my heart breaking with all this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
