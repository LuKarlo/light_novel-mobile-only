 “Fuh~… Breakthrough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Silence him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Quite so. Even though he was once my subordinate, he was still unpleasant… and frolicked a little too much…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar nodded at my words as he stood by me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, on to the counterattack. Tis time to silence him and put a twitch in that smile.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Listening to all those reliable words, I catch my breath, and clench my fists to check the sensations in my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No problems. Shinobu’s treatment worked and I’m back in form.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well then, child. To begin with…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right, Shinobu, Kron, Princess, Rebal, and Fu. It’s a bit dangerous, so I need you all to go to the corner of the room. Take everyone who has collapsed with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eh!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll take care of him myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first thing I had to do was to keep everyone away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believed that maid, Machio, the ninja girl and Kron would be a hit, but the child would be distracted should the others be attacked… therein lies the problem. That being the case, it would be best if they were not there in the first place.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what he said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s the reason I was poisoned in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was distracted by the fact the bald guy, who was an enemy, turned out that way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the current group, even if I’m told, “don’t react no matter who gets hit on your side,” it’s impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, according to Tre’ainar’s judgment, it was better to fight alone from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, losing Shinobu’s Ninja Arts and Kron’s Daybreak Eye was unfortunate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, wait, Earth! What do you mean?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… we should work together here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Earth! We also…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey, we die together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m with you… I said that, didn’t I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the princess and the others didn’t seem to back down at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s a natural reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys would say “let’s fight together”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You must persuade them somehow. In this sort of situation… they will slow you down. Tell them so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah. Can I say “you guys are in the way, so you should back down”… like that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu, Kron, and… the past that I’ve already cut off… but, after all, they were childhood friends who used to be good friends in the past, and now, even if it’s awkward, I can’t say that so plainly to the guys who have chased me all the way here. I can’t be that coldhearted…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… And we… no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth…it’s ‘something like that’… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu, who was about to refuse to back down with everyone, seemed calm but with a somewhat sad expression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We are… holding you back…… rather, we’re a liability… it’s that sort of thing… isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We can’t help Earth… is that what you’re saying?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t say it, but it seems that only Fu has guessed what I really meant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I thought we caught up today, but… you’ve already gone a lot farther than us… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, it’s been that way since I was a kid… this guy…… unlike the princess, me, and Rebal, he always took a step back, appeased everyone, read the air…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… what’s that? W, we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re… holding him back…… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess and Rebal looked shocked by Fu’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… kuh… urg…… is that so? Honey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… is that what you mean? Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Shinobu and Kron had regretful expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess, let’s go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, at… Fu…… why…… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You too, Rebal. Let’s keep the injured out of the way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, h, hey, Fu! What are you saying?! You can’t let Earth fight a Six Supremacy alone… we have to work together…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re weak. As we are now, we’ll only be a nuisance to Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eh!?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to admit it. Such thoughts appeared on everyone’s faces, but Fu put his hand on the shoulders of the princess and Rebal and pulled them away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing this, with a complicated expression, Shinobu nodded with a sigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s… what it takes to beat this monster… I’ll quietly withdraw so as not to bother Honey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey. Someday I’ll be the woman who stands by your side. So for now… I’ll silently be watching your back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… I…… I’ve just been relying on you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While convinced by Fu and Shinobu, Kron had a somewhat apologetic expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then… finally……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, there is no time for that, child. The enemy is not so good-natured, but a brute.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Hmm…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, if possible… without change, pretend to be unaware and go for the counter. In four seconds.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded to Tre’ainar in my mind and looked at Kron…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron… then…… can you give me a shot?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I suggested that she at least help me a little, Kron nodded happily and opened her magic eye—
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha. How long, will you goof ar――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Corkscrew】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as Kron was about to strengthen me with her magic eye, Paripi thought he caught me off guard and attacked the front with a sharp claw like a fiend to take me by surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, having heard it from Tre’ainar beforehand, and without panicking, I unleashed the counter shockwave on the right from the front.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu! Take Kron with you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, Honey! Good luck!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu! Rebal … Princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… y, yes, Earth! Come on, Rebal! You too Princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on, I will concentrate only on Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to think about anything else but working with Tre’ainar to take this thing down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, stay back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… forgive me…… I’m…… just weak… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu pulled with a strong tone, and maybe Rebal finally understood, I heard a voice full of humiliation and frustration, but his presence was moving away from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh … ugh … gu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… tears? Princess? Was it that frustrating? I haven’t seen tears from that princess since we were children… no, that doesn’t matter now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, you Black Weirdo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, relax those muscles that have stiffened after resting, and get into the zone!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, I’m just going to smash this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha it doesn’t matter if I’m a weirdo or a sage… but hey, don’t get all cocky thinking you can take me on alone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, it’s time for a repetition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Same as when I fought Jamdi’el, two-on-one, with the help of Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Here he comes. But given his claws, avoid infighting ‘for now’. Concentrate on the outfight. That is where it begins. If he cannot catch you, loses his temper and attacks Kron, I am sure to notice that first. At that time, think of it as a chance and hit the Great Magic Spiral. In other words, you have nothing to worry about!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu! 【Earth Misdirection Shuffle】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only difference was that this time the opponent had no hesitation in killing me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that makes me more nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That tension invited me into a deeper sea of concentration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And here is the point. If he does nothing superfluous, but attempts to anticipate your movements and capture you on his own… change gears.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I tried to focus with the small movements of my feet, Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To finally end him, you must have an infight at some point. However, as you lack poison resistance, a scratch of his claws will be fatal. To avoid that, there is something that must be done first. That is――――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a little conflicted inside, but… but…… he came up with a plan that seemed to appeal to me somehow, or one that was going to bring me to tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
