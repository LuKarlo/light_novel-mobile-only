<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not the first time I’ve fought an opponent with a different reach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this time, he’s not the kind of guy who makes big attacks like Mr. Aka and Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s faster and stronger than Bro and Rebal, and just a scratch of his attack is fatal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it was a proper fight, Jamdi’el would be stronger, but unlike Jamdi’el, who was holding back in the fight against me, he was ruthless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, he may be the strongest enemy ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never fought anyone like this guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, tis a rhythm with the left shockwave.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… yeah, that’s right. I’ve had the experience of fighting someone who’s far stronger than Paripi almost every day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, that again! Boring.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Move constantly with footwork, and hit the left long-distance punch while adjusting the timing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this guy is a Six Supremacy, it’ll only annoy him a little and won’t give a fatal injury.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You can’t beat me just by slapping me around, can you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, to deal damage to this guy, hit the right cannon or the Great Magic Spiral directly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in order to do that, I have to close the distance between us and create a situation where I can land a sure hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… don’t run away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, ora! Ra!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Focus on everything about Paripi, his eyes, his footsteps, the creak of his muscles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Always maintain a distance outside of Paripi’s attack range, and if the opponent tries to close in, retreat by that amount.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After repeating the attack several times, I could see that Paripi was getting more and more frustrated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… you really have bothersome legs… more quality of running rather than speed? No way, Hiro’s son was a second-rate swordsman, but his punches and footwork are decent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He will suddenly unleash a spell in the course of the conversation. Maybe to strike at the moment your mind relaxes at a compliment? Pay it no mind, crush it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But this isn’t a talent. It’s definitely the fruits of effort. I see, you’re a genius in that sense… yep, a genius at working hard! Dark Magic—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Sonic Jab】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hebu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi suddenly tried to unleash his magic in the flow of the conversation, but I was able to calmly deal with it beforehand because I had been given an earful by Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I slammed my left into his hand and mouth as he tried to invoke magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t talk so much. All you’re saying is a bunch of gibberish anyway.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… AH゛AH゛……IS゛ THAT゛ SO゛?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The corner of his mouth was smiling, but the blood-vessels Paripi’s forehead was prominent, it’s as if I could hear them snapping in anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, he’s not as naive as Jamdi’el to forget himself and rush at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… I’m really …… pissed off, but …… what to do about it?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This brat… then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, stay alert. To distract you here, Paripi may attack Kron and your friends.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the same tactic as when the bald guy was first done in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A daring attack to my surroundings just to distract and upset me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Should his attention turn from you to the people over there, beat him down mercilessly.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as long as Tre’ainar tells me in advance, the moment this guy deviates from me is also my opportunity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I can go for it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tch…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Paripi seemed to think about something for a moment, but he didn’t attack everyone, and he remained focused on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hou~, this one… apparently, he seems more vigilant than I expected.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar smiled at Paripi’s state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『From the way you have fought so far… your movements…… it may be dangerous to take focus away even for a moment just to provoke you… such are Paripi’s thoughts.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What an honor… can I think that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A Six Supremacy was being wary of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As such you must concentrate more. Do not underestimate your opponent, remain vigilant, victory against a focused Six Supremacy would be difficult, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s right. It means that the difficulty level has increased considerably.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~ I give… I would have liked to know if I could… the mystery surrounding you. Then, I’d love for us to be friends and enliven the new era ahead panay…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I give I give… it’s not mature to get pissed off at being teased by a kid, but …… okay, let’s just tear it up properly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His ferocity grew. This is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, so fast!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, stop prancing around, will yoooooooooouuu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He howled, and the speed went up — but if I shift the timing with my misdirection…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a wide range attack! Blow it away with a tornado of the Great Magic Spiral!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get ripped apart… 【Wicked Funeral Claw Melody】! Play ♫do re mi fa so la ti do♫!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Magic Spiral, Earth Spiral Wall】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, you got it! Moreover, a surprisingly good decision! …… But!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a blow or a medium-range attack, but a wide range attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that’s the case, I’ll throw everything off with the tornado wall that is created by raising the Great Magic Spiral above my head…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you use the Great Demon Spiral in the breakthrough state, your magical power will be quickly exhausted!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Let him believe so, do not use Magical Breathing yet! Leave only ‘three kilo-class spells’ worth of magic power!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi doesn’t know. That I can use Magical Breathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, this was another strategy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha, hello sunny tornado!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Earth Misdirection Sh—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right! Your scampering is an eyesore, but in short, as long as I shatter what’s underfoot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a strategy to ruin my foothold and prevent me from using footwork, which was also used in the battle against Jamdi’el a few days ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a slight attack and defense, Paripi also saw through my weakness and exploited it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I have already experienced that move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terra Spell, 【Kilo Earth Road】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I crouched down and put my hand on the shattered floor and laid the dirt at my feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Even though it’s beginner’s magic, it’s a terran attribute magic… footing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Create a foothold so that I can use footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This surprised Paripi a little——
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihaha, how cheeky. So easy going!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bubo!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I could stand back up and use my footwork, he slammed a middle kick into my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A moment’s delay can be fatal on the battlefield! Even the slightest stop in front of me is fatal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Here he comes! Close combat! Look only at his arm! You need not pay attention to the feet! Brace for foot attacks! Tis impossible to avoid everything!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shaaaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gafu?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, I was caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can avoid his claws with my dynamic vision and zone, but it’s impossible to avoid all of the Six Supremacy’s martial arts with just that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was too focused on my upper body to deal with his lower body kicks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once again, Paripi’s middle kick pierced my abdomen and my internal organs were viscerally shocked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahaha, are you only paying attention to my claws? No, you’re so wary of my claws, but as a result, you can’t follow my footwork! And as a result, you’re getting clawed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『His claws will swing down from overhead, dodge to the left, and immediately roll away. As he comes around, take the toe kick with your forehead and endure it!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… bugu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His feet stopped. His face looked down in agony. At Tre’ainar’s direction, I rolled across the ground and backed away, but was kicked as hard as possible by his toe as he went around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gahh… g, 【Great Demon Head-butt】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Has my forehead been crushed? My head was ringing… if it weren’t for the determination to “endure” for a moment, my consciousness would definitely have been blown away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But compared to Mr. Aka’s punch…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There! He stopped for a moment with pain in his toes! Smash into his crotch! Of course that’s not -“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Crush! 【Great Demon Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oops… Hihaha, can’t let you crush me, for the sake of the maidens of the world! But…… you did it, kid!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hit his toe with a Great Demon Head-butt, but there was no damage. On the contrary, he kicked me in the face once more, as if hit with a stone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! Oh… no, no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, strong… too strong… this is a Six Supremacy… we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… I hear… voices of concern for me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t stand it anymore! As I thought, me too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W… wait, princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu! Let go! If this goes on, Earth will be killed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But nothing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She can’t help but think so… but…… it’s all for this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tch, is that the limit of their patience? However, I simply hope they not to get in the way…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is all according to Tre’ainar’s expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All to win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used my martial arts and got cornered by him, and from there… so……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… I…… I’ve seen you. I’m still looking at you. Believing in you… so…… win! Earth! Fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. I don’t need any help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just cheer me on and pray for me, that’s all!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There! A backwards turn to throw a kick! Receive it at that angle, in that position… be blown away! And right after that, release your magic! Cast two kinds of spells! A mud wall to momentarily block his view… and a thunder spell after picking ‘that’ up!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just need it to work this once!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was my last leg… and…… no worries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if he is wary of you… for Paripi right now, ‘that attack’ alone will be completely unexpected! A blind spot in his thoughts! He can neither react nor respond! Strike him down!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, my bad… on the ground over there… I’ll borrow it without permission, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gran Chario.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note

 We’re getting ready for volume 2 ……, or rather, we’re releasing it. The pictures of Mr. Aka… Bro… and Shinobu are already in my hands!
