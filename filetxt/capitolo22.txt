<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s magic training period in the exercise ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was deep in thought while watching my classmates at the Academy practice their magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah… Hey, Tre’ainar. Why did you want to do to destroy the human race? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment I was concerned about my career path, while not finding an answer had me worried, I suddenly asked Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What, so sudden…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, you told me a while ago… I’ve been thinking a lot about it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What reasons did you have to become the Great Demon King and try to destroy the human race?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a counselor, I feel very out of place, but at this time I naturally confided my worries about my career paths to Tre’ainar, something I had never done before for my parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar also answers without any particular objection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, there was the simple desire to destroy ugly human beings… In order to unify the demons in the demon world, it was necessary to create a common enemy… In the first place, my desire was to acquire territory far from the dark cloud-filled demon world in the sunless lands… If just given, then there is no point in it. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the scale is too big, it does not come intuitively, and it is not helpful. It’s obvious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, the reasons I became a Great Demon King were from too long ago, I fail to recall my goals, dreams and such immature notions… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What, you forgot…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis just… one thing I could say was… I wanted to expand our world… so I thought. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar whispers so with his eyes looking a little distant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The roots of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar. The desire is to expand the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why he forgot the ideals that led to the Great Demon King, or whether he was upset, but it still seems to be ’what I wanted to do’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Used to be… I wanted to be like my father… I used to think about it when I was a kid.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now I don’t have such ambitions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It became even more so after hearing the word said by Tre’ainar a little while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「To find my calling, through the 【Imperial Knight】… could be it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not a path to use as a stepping stone either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, regardless of finding what you want to do, once you become an Imperial Knight, you will probably have plenty of work and not enough free time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you look at my father who doesn’t come home at all, you’ll understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… will one not suffice? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I am not familiar with the employment situation of people in the world today, but… I believe in your father’s time… I think it was a time when one could not choose what path to take, right? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a sermon that I always heard somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think that such a sermon would come out of Tre’ainar’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I always listened to these old people’s sermons, such as ‘in our time’ and ‘things used to be harder than they are now’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But maybe something is wrong with me today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I listened seriously to Tre’ainar’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In a peaceful world, like yours, you have the power, the money, the environment which caters to hope, and so being idle is a supreme luxury and a sin. You must understand that. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been working harder than usual for the past few days, but my goal is to surprise my father and the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That ‘factor’ that has tremendous influence on one’s life, I don’t have that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Therefore, child. Having deliberated on the mater… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar changed completely from a serious expression, and smiled as if he had evil intent…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Without benefiting from your father’s influence… to remain in place so you may have a means to discover your true calling. Tis not that one is nonexistent, is it? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But that… I believe tis too difficult a course for such a spoiled boy. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help opening my eyes wide. A way to find out what I want to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If there is such a thing, naturally I want you to teach me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what bothers me is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey hey, is the road too tough for pompons? What is it? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was asking sulking a little bit at Tre’ainar’s words as he was trying to provoke me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heeey guuuys! I’m baaaaack!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such bull… Don’t frolic about.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two voices suddenly echo in the training ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… They…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was nostalgic for me and everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu! And Rebal! …… I just returned from special studies abroad! Heheeee, everyoooooone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously… So noisy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two men were there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Kyaaaaaaa!! It’s Fuuuu!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Aaaah, Rebal!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Fu, Rival!! You’re back?”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment they saw them, their classmates cheered, and the girls were screaming, especially with their eyes shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis unpleasant. What is happening? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Oh…… they are also classmates. And…… just…… my childhood friends.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And for me, they’re not just classmates.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho. But…… Hm…… Oh… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar seemed to feel something when she saw them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, they are the kind of people who get a reaction from the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heheee, how are you all?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I’m not growing any taller if you don’t Fu. So cute!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wa, wawawa, come on, guys, get back and stop that this instance!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No good! Fu is too huggable!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Waa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I’m so sneaky!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, the man who is immediately surrounded and crushed on by the girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He has the shortest height among the boys of the academy, and an infant body type lower than the girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, his childish face, glasses, and such a childish behavior are always very popular with girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「His magic power and capacity is higher than the princess’… In the field of magic, he’s first grade. The son of the 【Great Mage】, one of the seven heroes.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh… I see…… So that is the reason… the little one there… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he is the son of the seven heroes same as me, and he is a childhood friend since we were kids.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, he inherited his father’s talent, who was a great mage, and became famous as a ‘Magical Boy Genius’, and was especially popular among women in the Imperial capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””””Kyaaaaa! Mr. Rebal!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My ears hurt. Don’t talk to me if you have no reason to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””So Dreamyyyyyy!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While folding his arms with bored ,sour faced expression, he had a cold attitude towards the girls swarming him as if he found it irritating. Yet the girls found that cool demeanor from the beautiful, long-haired swordsman very attractive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What about that tall specimen of beauty?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. He is better than a princess when it comes to sword skill and combat ability. He’s the strongest man in our academy. The Man Who Draws the Blood of the Seven Heroes’ 【Sword Saint】…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, oh… I was there. He fought only with a sword, using no magic, and certainly, he had that assuming air of coldness to him. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he’s the same as me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, like Fu, a man who is said to be ‘The Sword Saint’s Successor’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is said that his ability is already comparable to that of an 【Advanced Warrior】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both of them have inherited their parents’ genes and the expectations of many people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Being witness to this has made me nostalgic. I never have I imagined there would be so many legacies. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh… Last year, the Empire sent out talented people for study and training abroad in exchanges with other countries.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Were you not chosen?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It irritated me when he hit a sore point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「There are only two spots for foreign students. It goes the top two students in the ranking. The princess was the overall top last year, but she declined to study abroad, so those two who were second and third at the time became international students.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho… I see.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What do you…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In other words, your second grade in the rankings is due to being advanced by the absences of ‘those two’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Shut up!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s exactly right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like the princess, the two of them are not equal to the princess in general, but they have the one aspect that makes them ‘second to none’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it was the one aspect that was reminiscent of the talent of their parent, who was a hero, everyone had expectations of them, and they always met those expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike me…
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
