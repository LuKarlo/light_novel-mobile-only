 Irritating little sh*t!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m a little cautious, but when it comes to simple physical ability, there were quite a few at this level in the turbulent times of the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tearing him apart is easy enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, there are a lot of interesting mysteries around this kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really don’t get it, and my curiosity is piqued panay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So what to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, just gut him, and if he’s lucky enough to still be alive, I’ll think about it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahahahaha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, the martial art and footwork that this kid has desperately mastered are certainly at a high level, but not for me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I should be concerned about with his technique is the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But with how he’s using the breakthrough, he should be about out of magic power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, even if they don’t work on me, I just need to watch out for his “footwork”, “shockwaves”, any “lucky punch” and “counterpunch”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially, depending on where the punch hits, even I could suffer a little damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This kid is scared of my poison claws and doesn’t want to get close, but he will if he’s cornered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Soiya, off you go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaha?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How’s my footwork?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s so worried about my claws, he can’t handle my kicks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fact that he got hit by a backward kick, a big one at that, was proof of this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He violently got knocked away from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And after rolling on the ground like that… the finishing blow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s over! Hihahahaha, die!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It ends here. It took some doing, but I’ll finally gut him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the end of the roll after being blown away, the kid will be stabbed by my claws―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu, Terra Spell, 【Kilo Mud Wall】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not gonna give up! Still with the struggle! So easy going!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He rolled over, put his hand on the ground, and pulled out a Mud Wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even with so little magic left in him, he was still struggling?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in the end, it’s only kilo class. Might as well be a piece of paper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At best, it blocked my field of vision… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahahahahaha, I’ll smash them all together head-on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh~, I see. Is that your goal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Block my view, brace yourself behind the wall, and slam a counter into me as I break through the wall and come rushing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the wall breaks down, a desperate counter attack towards me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s all you can do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now then, do I blow it all up with magic? But I was too excited earlier, and to be honest, I don’t have much magic left in me either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would be a piece of cake to kill the rest of them all, but I’d better conserve a little magic in case the Seraphs waiting outside burst in?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, now that I have a general idea of the power of this kid, I can just knock him out head on without any hassle!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll break down the wall, pause for a moment there, and intercept the kid as he leaps out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll take the counterpunch and fake it, and the moment he defenselessly throws his body out first, knock him down into despair!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to hammer into his body that there was no hope at all for any last clever strategy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oruuaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once that was decided, first of all, the Mud Wall, which was almost like scrap paper, was smashed by force, and from behind the wall…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, come on? But I’ve taken all you got… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I broke down the wall and said, “Come on, jump out” and I poised myself with my hands out to catch the punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what jumped out from behind the wall was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was… the nostalgic… link to my past… the Hero……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi… Hiro? No…… Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not… Hiro!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that he’s as immensely powerful as that idiot Hiro can be, nor does he radiate an overwhelming sword aura.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, for a moment, I mistook him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So much so that the kid that made me feel the shadow of Hiro…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooooooooooooohh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The kid, not with a fist… holding a sword in his other hand… jumped out…… with a horizontal slash at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the last Magic Sword in my life! Final, 【Thunder Slash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th… that move!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic was nothing compared to Hiro’s. Even the power of the sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, that Magic Sword here!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a fist?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a punch!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, indeed, the information said that he was a Magic Swordsman before the Graduation Match!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it was completely unexpected that this kid would wield a Magic Sword in this situation right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my wrists onwards, which were defenselessly exposed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, uh, oh, wh, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatt?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ridiculous! Wh, hot, pain, c, cut off!? Both my hands!? Regeneration, no, magic power, not immediately… how?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… that technique! That move of Hiro’s… and Earth’s!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… here…… sword!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, but! He did it! Earth’s sword… a Six Supremacy’s hands!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing… Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A… oooww… damn brats, were surprised… no, of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even those guys were surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The kids who were his childhood friends and the doll who stayed with him until recently were also surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, it was unexpected for everyone here, including me, that this kid would use a Magic Sword at this point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I was hit!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The blind spot in your thinking, let me hit you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, this, braaat! Ts, th, that sword, where did you… Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your hands can’t regenerate right away, can they?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sword that kid was holding, oh yes, the sword that was used by one of the small fish that I kicked away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was blown away and lying on the floor… this kid picked up the sword that “just happened” to be lying around after I hit him, and at the last minute, used this Magic Sword!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blind spot in my thinking? Certainly, this was totally unexpected, and I was rather too surprised to react.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only thing I watched out for was the kid’s footwork and counterpunches…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, ha~, ha~… how… how is, how about thaaaaaaaaaat I did it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You mean he can cut off my hands?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I recall, according to reports, the power of this kid’s Magic Sword is second-rate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His sword skills should be inferior to the princess and the Second Sword Saint, and I kicked them both away earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what he did just now was definitely much stronger than those two!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I couldn’t handle it on the spur of the moment!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been six months since I learned to fight the way I do now. But I’ve been working hard for more than 10 years with the Magic Sword.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But then one day, ‘he’ told me that the Magic Sword didn’t suit me. No matter how hard I try, I can’t surpass my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was caught off guard, he still achieved the great feat of slashing my hands off with a Magic Sword, as one of the Six Supremacy, this kid suddenly … no…… I’m sure about that… previously he talked about……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That story… hey, Rebal! Certainly in your match…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s what Earth said… in the match against me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At the time, I didn’t know it was going on at all, but… come to think of it…… who? Who would say that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, was Honey originally a Magic Swordsman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well! Was that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. In that match, I also had a peek through the magic crystal, that kid said that… That’s right…… who was that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the second generation kids, don’t they know who either?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So even Hiro and the others don’t know… the one who made him give up the Magic Sword… for his current fighting style…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… Little man… well done… and…… that was the last time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Sadiz, are you awake?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, princess… don’t worry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, and more than that, Sadiz… about Earth… you…… do you know anything?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… yes…… more or less…… I’ve heard of it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that the maid who had fainted has woken up, but only that maid seemed to know something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve been trying for 10 years to get good at it. But you know what ‘he’ just said to me ‘now’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, I don’t get it. Who the hell is that? Hey, it’s not the other Six Supremacy. Then who else?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Magic Sword can’t surpass my father. Still, that doesn’t mean my 10 years have been a complete waste… he said…… today…… it brought me to this moment!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy is blabbing on because he’s high on excitement, but… no, my hands are … useless, what should I do? Calm down…… don’t get upset about this… for now, distance…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My ten years were enough to give my fathers’ former rival, a Six Supremacy, a pretty good shot. That’s enough for me! And this is my last sword! And from here on, it’s my way! Come on, let’s get this over with!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this kid didn’t want to beat me with his sword, he put the sword on the floor and raised his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy, from here on, with his bare hands… now that my poisonous claws were gone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, I was certainly surprised, but… don’t get cocky! You just slashed my hands off! Is it because you no longer have to be scared by poisonous claws? But kid, now you’re completely out of magic, aren’t you? Now that you can’t even use the breakthrough, I’ll―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Su~, fuh~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just now…… he took something like a deep breath… the magic power of the kid that should be completely empty… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no way!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?! M, magic power is restored… what…… no way!? No way, it’s Magical Breathing!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahaha! You finally got to show me, your stupid surprised face! But from here on out, I’m going to be all over you! Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The distance I had planned to have was closed in an instant!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seriously, his magical power recovered and he could use the breakthrough!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, this is really what’s happening! Magical Breathing!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like the Great Demon Spiral, Magical Breathing was something even Sis couldn’t do!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s more of a physical skill than magic! That’s why she said it can’t be copied even with the Heraldic Eye!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why can this kid do it!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A cheat technique that allows him to unleash magic almost inexhaustibly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who taught him!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! Goraaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unless he was directly under the tutelage of the Great Demon King, absolutely no one can――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Great Demon King…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Im, possible…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, how could something so weird pop up…in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the “no way” that went through my head made me more upset than ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King is dead. There should be no doubt about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what if…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? That should be impossible. Yet, if we ignore that impossibility, it all makes sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This kid shouldn’t even know me, but he’s wary of my poisonous claws…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Listen… Earth――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Heartbreak Shot】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bupyupa… wa… gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Solar Plexus Blow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kaeh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ve kicked me too many times, you bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The heart and… the solar plexus… not good…… on top of that…… the timing, the angle, the power couldn’t be worse…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash】!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah… Wa,it… let’s talk man to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No need to listen to anything from you, bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no, seriously… it’s really… importan…… ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know! There’s nothing I want to hear about, at all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And my jaw… it’s bad…… this guy, all these powerful repeated hits to my weak points…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s all on you, bastaaaaaaaaard!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it. I was also more or less confident in my toughness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was confident that I wouldn’t fall no matter how many hits I took from a kid ignorant of war and some miscellaneous small fish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if fists of this level were all slammed directly into my vitals, it wouldn’t be a fluke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And without my hands, I can’t defend myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t anticipate his movement because I’m at the mercy of this guy’s footwork, so I can’t even evade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
