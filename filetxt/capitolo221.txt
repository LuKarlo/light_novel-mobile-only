<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi, the bastard was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously. Even I was surprised when Tre’ainar first told me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With my Magic Sword, cut his hands off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Are you out of your mind!? I’ve wasted ten years of effort on the Magic Sword, and now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no way my half-baked Magic Sword would work against a Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For all that, there’s no way I could take him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Certainly, you are ill-suited for the Magic Sword. However, the days of effort spent were not in vain!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a serious expression on his face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Do not dismiss that time spent as a “waste”. Also allow me to enlighten you. Having fought and trained in your current fighting style, it has led to the growth of the arms, wrists, latissimus dorsi muscles, legs, hips and other parts of your body that are also necessary for a swordsman, and your magic has also been further refined with the use of breakthroughs and Magical Breathing. In other words, your Magic Sword prowess has naturally risen to a level beyond what it was six months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Wh, at…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― A sudden blow would be enough to sever his arm. As you currently are, the power of your Magic Sword would surpass that princess or even the Second Sword Saint.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t dismiss it as a waste. It all depends on how you use it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the endorsement of the Great Demon King, nothing else could grant me more confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, just as he said, the Magic Sword that I had spent over ten years on was rewarded here and now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I’m satisfied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I’m really free from regrets.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All that’s left is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All I have to do now is to blow this bastard away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ka, gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Low Altitude Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi, who has lost both hands, can’t handle my punches at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hit him with all my might, feeling the numbness in my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just single-mindedly hit the legendary Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, this brat! With my kick――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You need not take anymore! Focus and hit him in the opposite direction!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A guy, who wasn’t a kicking specialist like Bro, carelessly tried to kick me in the face with a front kick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I responded to his oncoming front kick with a right uppercut to the Achilles tendon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Short Upper】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah oh, ogoooooooooooooooooooooooooohh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Severed with a snap… no, I crushed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kid, just, gah, hold on… Time time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Jab】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, hagah?! Oh, hagaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, standing on one leg, his face contorted in pain, Paripi hurriedly tries to stop me, but… I punched that defenseless jaw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Evade…… no, he didn’t evade the punch… I dislocated his jaw!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He can’t speak fluently anymore with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, awesome… Earth! The Magic Sword he just used was amazing, but… I should say, he’s even more with his fists…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is Earth… yes… he’s even stronger than…… when he overwhelmed me in our match!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… there’s no doubt about it. I don’t know why Earth abandoned his Magic Sword and chose this way of fighting, and I don’t know how he was able to use the Great Demon King’s technique, but… this power of Earth is real!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Look closely, you guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not the son of a hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is Earth Lagann.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hero’s son you sought is no more. So instead, burn this present me into your eyes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fah~, ah, heavy hit… My Honey is no good nogoodnogood! You’re too cool! I’ve had enough… If you make me fall in love any more, my love for you will kill me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go, Earth, there! There it is! Ei, ei, eiii! Fight on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You guys need to calm down a bit… there’s visible heart steam coming out of Shinobu, and an excited Kron was jumping up and down in a punching motion imitating me… no…… I’ll make them fall in love with me… even more?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man! Now is the time… now is the time to let them know! The power of Earth Lagann!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The last push reached me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I’m already…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Go! Settle it here, child! Even if it means reaping his life… make sure you end it right here!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll finish him here! Cut him down! Pierce him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s over, Paripi!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After taking one more Magical Breath and restoring all my magic power again, I concentrated all that magic power in my right hand and raised it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That technique! He showed us at the end of the Graduation Match…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The technique that led Earth to leave the Imperial City…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… we… couldn’t stop Earth from running out… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, Little man… to your heart’s content!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaaah no more… shukii… Honey~♡”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to use that technique in front of them again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is this technique that will decide the end, not the Magic Sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “gah, kaha… Hah~, hah~… Earth…… kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Paripi, who set his jaw on his shoulder and forcibly pushed it, turned to me with his mouth that was finally able to move with a bitter smile…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… Earth… is there someone else… inside you… by any chance?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was, in a sense, the closest words to the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Paripi is not as blind as Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From what has happened so far, he may have arrived at a hypothesis that would not normally be possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, aside from Sadiz, who I told myself, this guy came closest to answering my mystery.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, the right answer isn’t only inside me… now at my back… sometimes by my side… always ingrained in my very being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he’s by my side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We will continue to be together!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Magic Spiral, Earth, Spiral Break】!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t confirm or deny it, I just slammed the Great Magic Spiral into Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It all pierced through like a windpipe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feel of my hand undoubtedly penetrated and ripped through Paripi’s torso.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ea————————eh!!??.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The demon’s final scream echoed through the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there, after I’ve exhausted all the magical power I had…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ka… ah…… gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could already tell just by looking at him that he was incapable of fighting, and there he was, lying there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, ha~, ha~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I recovered once more with Magical Breathing and exhausted it all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A strong sense of emptiness and exhaustion washed over me, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He… he did…… it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing… truly…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… Honey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excellent… Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth won!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won? Did I…… beat a Six Supremacy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing the voices around me, I looked up involuntarily, and when I saw the reality in front of me, I clenched my fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right … I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And before I knew it, I was screaming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The one who has fallen was Paripi of the Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one left standing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one who won!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu… how admirable… no…… child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, for a moment when I screamed with excitement, Tre’ainar looked at Paripi with a serious face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He can no longer move, yet… he still… lives…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that I don’t…… know what those words mean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I was prepared for that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It just so happened that Paripi was alive now, because this guy had more vitality than expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that feeling… again… for the purpose of taking lives… killing… people…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Pay it no mind. There is no need to take lightly the feeling that remains in that hand, but… if you do not do it here, you may regret it even more!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somewhere in the back of my mind, I almost held back slightly against “this moment”, but Tre’ainar pushed me back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, right now this guy, definitely right here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m sorry…… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I heard a woman’s voice that sounded so faint and sad that it seemed to disappear…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Forgiveness Song… ～♪ ～♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard a gentle …… but haunting tone of a flute that touched my heart … I wonder why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I hear this sound… I can’t forgive him, but… I don’t have to kill him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This sound is… this flute… eh! Child, cover your ears! Do not be taken by this tone!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? Oh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I take one more step, I can bury Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, in front of me, lying on his back, with a big hole in his torso, I see Paripi, whose upper and lower body are barely connected with a little flesh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahi, ha, ga, hi, ha… Hiha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike humans, this vitality was unique to demons, and even in such a state, he was not dead yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it’s easy to put the finisher on the guy who can’t even move anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If we go this far… already…… isn’t that enough?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No more…… I feel like I don’t have to go that far…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This, tone… this flute is… ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? That girl…… what is she…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “C, come to think of it, I, I wondered where she was…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That one…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Why is she…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Hey what the heck…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also looked back at the voice of the princess and the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there was someone I didn’t expect to see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The sound of the flute now… sound of Emotional Manipulation Magic…… not quite complete brainwashing, but… enough for the child who has never killed before to stay his hands…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? No, I knew she came along with the princess’ group, but no, where has she been all this time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And why come out now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would she…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s Coman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coman was a classmate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was brought here by the princess, so why… and…… why does she have such a sad face?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is she crying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we were kids, we played and talked a few times, but once we entered the academy, we became estranged from each other and I rarely talked to her properly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was always odd, jumpy, and withdrawn…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh… how miserable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Like this… uh… I can’t believe that I get to talk to Earth face to face like this for the first time in a long time… in the academy, the princess was always by Earth’s side, so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… for getting you into this mess… really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s not the kind of person who would cause any problems, and she’s a kind girl who wouldn’t even kill an insect…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really… that princess………………… so annoying, isn’t she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time, this girl gave me goosebumps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
