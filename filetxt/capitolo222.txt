<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I beat the Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could say so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I defeated Jamdi’el, the Seraphs appeared, and this time, of all people, a classmate?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, what did she just say?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t just me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’ group were also flabbergasted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it’s amazing… that Earth, who should have been inferior to Rebal and the princess, was victorious against a Six Supremacy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coman wiped her tears away and smiled sadly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m being praised, I’m feeling pretty giddy right now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah… kaha… Co…… man… Coman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, lying on his back, a part of his body gone, and his head connected to his torso with only a small piece of flesh, Paripi opened his eyes in a hoarse voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is he still alive?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can you move?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… no… nope…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so… never… I didn’t think you would lose…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… lose…… huh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hold on…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Coman!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is the meaning of this, Coman? Why are you with a Six Supremacy!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I, the princess, Rebal, and Fu all raised our voices in astonishment at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why was Coman with Paripi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why? I have a connection with this man… is that strange? Is it surprising that I was such a girl? Do you people…… know me well enough … to find this surprising?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, in response to our astonishment, Coman, who should have been smiling, replied in a sullen manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… no one knew the real me… after all…… no one could see me until the end…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And now… when the opportune moment is around here … now … it’s time to end it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words from Coman, who should have always been timid, condemning us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, Tre’ainar, who was beside me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This little girl… apparently she was a spy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… This one… she is human, but she has been placated by Paripi… well, I had my concerns, yet I was unaware of Paripi’s vast espionage network…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar declared so about Coman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Coman… you…… were you a spy?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it true, Coman!? Why?! Ever since we were little… weren’t we friends? You…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It can’t be… you…… wait, so your parents!? The Piper family were…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Coman!? What do you mean? Explain it properly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my words, the princess and the others were also stunned and raised their voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Coman smiled sadly at us again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In the first place, my house was this man’s followers before I was born…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And, spies, in short, are traitors, aren’t they? I… was never among Earth’s circle of friends, was I? Did you think of me as a friend? Besides…… even the princess and company couldn’t see Earth or understand anything about him… and claim to be friends… how would I fit? For this journey to track Earth down, you simply brought me along because my abilities were useful, right? That’s why I’m so pissed off.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m the same. I’ve been watching Earth for over a decade and I didn’t understand anything about him… that he had gained enough strength to beat this man… really…… how useless… I am.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She doesn’t answer our questions clearly. But we couldn’t say anything back to Coman’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, in response to Coman’s words, Paripi, who was lying on the verge of death, opened his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I lost… oh I see… I was beat… on the contrary… if you hadn’t been there… I would really be a goner this time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… you lost to Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… I see… yah~…… I say…… I got beat Panay…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A smile on his lips… but the smile on Paripi’s face was always a devilishly cruel smile, so what’s different?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is Paripi calm now, as if somewhat refreshed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Paripi…?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also had a somewhat surprised reaction to Paripi’s state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… this match… you win. I lost to you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You were strong… so strong Panay… well…… I’m not sure if it was one on one, but… I don’t feel like using that as an excuse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, in such a situation, I couldn’t help but clench my fists as I felt my heart burn with excitement at the words he just said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You found a path that suits you … still, if there’s something that’s still missing… then make up for it… play around with an idea… and the courage to do it…… you’ve done it brilliantly… Hihaha… splendid…… is all…… I can say…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shouldn’t believe a single word of this blabbermouth, but for once …… I can’t help but think that he’s not all bad…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From one of the Six Supremacy to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is the ferocity disappearing from Paripi, that mass of malice? … This man… really…… have you succumbed to the child…… to that extent? Hmm… this is…… tis the first time I have seen it. I am witnessing something unusual.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For even Tre’ainar to say that, Paripi’s words right now may be true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just thinking so… damn it…… why am I so happy, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… such a terrible place to hear a compliment… at this point, you… are a guy I think needs to get finished off… Coman… and are you still going to protect him?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right, what shall we do from here on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get out of the way, Coman!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly, letting him leave this place alive would be a folly. Tis best to put an end to him here.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I went into the breakthrough state and warned Coman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Coman stared at me, and the next moment she put the flute he was holding onto her mouth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sound Magic, Mega Dissonance!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a dissonance shockwave! Crush it head-on!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Sonic Jab!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though she suddenly unleashed a sonic shockwave, I crushed it outright…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “kuh… Sound Magic, Shadow-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Too late! Great Demon Jab!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coman tried to unleash a homing spell, but this time I aimed a jab at the flute before it could be activated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah … so … fast…… amazing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, you can’t use the flute anymore, can you? Besides, now I can hit the flute with a jab before you blow on it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh … yes … that’s … yeah … I can’t… amazing…… really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi is too dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was saying something refreshing right now, but I don’t know what he’ll do when his body gets back to normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t afford to leave him like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised and shocked to learn that Coman and her parents were Paripi’s spies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stand down, Coman. You’re right, I didn’t see you at all… I didn’t understand… but…… even so…… you’re not so indifferent that I would just beat you up by force…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not that I don’t think anything of it… but…… I can’t just overlook this guy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was shocked, but that’s why I couldn’t move, so I let it go. I can’t afford to do that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I saw the memory of the Heavenly King. That bald guy is also extreme in many ways, but… he was the mastermind! As a result, it’s even possible that humans will go to war with the Seraphs! Don’t you understand? If I made one wrong move, he would have killed us all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Fufu… Earth… you sound like a hero.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t make fun of me! I’ll say it again! Get out of my way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I appealed to Coman with the intention of “ending” this now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Coman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is how… Earth… is seriously talking… with such a dirty, ugly girl like me… even though the real me is terrible… and I hate everyone…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How…… did I end up…… in this mess? Even though I… no…… the world is… but…… Huh!? Ugh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She smiled sadly again, but suddenly crouched down, holding her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s wrong? When I thought about it and tried to look into her face, suddenly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… Earth… is watching my every move… if I fight… will he watch me more? Will he hit me? Will he force me to surrender…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Ah~…… Hey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha… then… I wonder if I should have done this sooner? Being inconspicuous… minding that woman… because it’s more troublesome to catch the attention of royalty… left me constantly pissed off … ah…… can I show myself now… I wonder if it’s okay? I… I wonder if they would see me? Hey, how… I wonder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh… sort of like… this girl, she’s in a different direction from Jamdi’el and Shinobu, but somehow similar… yeah…… in a way… creeps me out… was this the kind of girl she was? No, is this her true nature? It’s like she’s suddenly a different person…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha… stop stop, Coman dear. Don’t do it. Don’t show… ‘That face’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… eh…… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, it was Paripi who stopped Coman who was about to go out of control.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the sound of Paripi’s voice, Coman, who had a face agitated with excitement, suddenly stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your magic isn’t for a one-on-one fight… you’re no match for Earth in his current state of sensitivity panay…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… but…… if this continues…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know … both of them … no … you and your parents are done for… Earth won’t let it go… and there’s no benefit to him… even if he lets me live now. I don’t suppose you trust me in any way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Paripi turns to me with a small smile on his lips.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you looking at me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don’t even have to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s a given, dying bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trust? Absolutely not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to let it pass.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… goho… if…… if the ‘someone’ in you is the ‘one’ I know… he would say ‘Kill me without mercy’…… I guess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… I was right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Too close… this guy, it seemed he has almost reached my secret by now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m not going to tell him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, stop, Coman. It can’t be helped.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Then…… what are you going to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t worry about it, I’ve already… decided…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Decided? What? Did he resolve himself? Did he give up by any chance? No, he’s not like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The benefits of keeping me alive… is that I could start earning your trust… little by little from now on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come again?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he wasn’t making any sense at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coman and I, and even Tre’ainar, tilted our heads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey I don’t get it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the heck was Paripi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Earth Lagann.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, uh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Paripi suddenly became serious… I mean, could he even say anything with a serious tone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that was a trivial matter, and the next words that came out of Paripi’s mouth were…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll… be your subordinate… okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Ha?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””‘Hah!!??.'”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather than inciting the idiot Seraphs or dealing drugs… watching to see where you go… looks like it’s going to be more fun Panay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Auditory hallucination? I misheard? Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh, e… eh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh… Tre’ainar froze with a strange expression on his face and his mouth wide open!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then… he must have also misheard that just now, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, as I am… for the time being… I can’t accompany you… until I heal… but… I…… I will absolutely… be useful Panay!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “E… even if it kills me, I won’t accept!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway…… I was so surprised that I couldn’t think straight either, but I managed to squeeze that much out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not at all, that’s my impression after all?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Look at this devastation! Everyone, we’ve all been beaten and in tatters!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the bald guy was gutted, and the prince, already out of the loop, was poking his head closer!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, sure enough…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””………………”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
