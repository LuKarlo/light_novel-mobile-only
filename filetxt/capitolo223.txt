 The battle was over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh…… wh, what’s this… this is Coman… and to top it all off, even the Six Supremacy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, as if her heart had been completely broken, the princess sat back on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, who until recently should have been next to us all these days… we were separated for a few months, but… we finally caught up today… what in the world this…… don’t you think so? Rebal… Fu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Before my very eyes, I was shown the distance between Earth and us… at the end of the day… the Six Supremacy, who we couldn’t even stand against with all of us together… admitted defeat to become his subordinate? Is this…… a dream? …… the…… the dimensions are too different… Earth… is right in front of me yet… endlessly far away…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed she had a lot of thoughts about me in this battle, but Princess… I’m surprised about this, too…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who will be whose subordinate? No, no, no, what the hell is this guy planning, to stab me in the back?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This man, whose every breath exhales jest and never shows his true feelings… is getting more heated with every word… I never… is he serious?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also upset. That’s my impression. That’s how serious this man’s words were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goh… ugh… Coman dear… the magic crystal?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now, mine… is here…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your parents… where’s Koaso?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The timing was right and we may be exposed, so I told them to leave the Imperial City.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hihahaha, gohogo… okay. Then, give the magic crystal to Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah… ah, Earth… here…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t get my head around the situation that made Coman seem to fade away despite everything, and I couldn’t do anything to the point that Coman, who was supposed to be my enemy, walked right up to me, and just handed me a magic crystal she had taken out of the pocket of her clothes and I accepted it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If she had attacked me with a knife or magic, I would have been in danger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! I’m going to hide for a while to heal myself up, but… if you have any problems in the meantime, you can always use that to contact me. I’ll provide you all the information I have on the world, of the light or the shadows. If you are in need of funds for your forces, I am at your disposal. If you are short of women, I can help with that, regardless of race, age, or status. If you want, you can have Coma――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t offer me this stuff out of the blue!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A palm-sized round crystal handed over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seemed it belonged to Coman, but once I received it, Paripi started talking about it to me, regardless of my intention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, Paripi… you were supposed to be dying, but aren’t you as energetic as ever?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait! Well, I still didn’t say I’d make you my subordinate! I don’t need this magic crystal! Hold on, Coman! What are you bastards thinking?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… ah… we’re in the middle of a conversation, okay? You should probably listen …… all the way to the end. …… yeah, I think I had some good suggestions…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care! I mean, hearing you out seems more dangerous!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not that. I won’t listen to anything like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t get swept away… anyway, I have to do something about this situation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, you are one dangerous bastard without a doubt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I told you. I’m more useful to you alive…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No need! I don’t want anything from you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the beginning, Tre’ainar said, “Don’t believe any of this man’s words”, so I rejected Paripi’s proposal without any negotiations or nonsense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly, I was surprised by this man’s proposal, but tis fine, child. As the child is now, this man’s presence can only be poisonous.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, too, was aghast at Paripi, but crossed his arms and nodded in agreement with my response.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiha… ha ha…… well then…… Earth… to the other person in your life… your ally… I offer a gift… then…… what do you say?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi has a suspicious smile on his face. The face was obviously thinking of some evil scheme.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the words are not directed at me, but at Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The key that leads to the deepest part… of the ruins deep underneath the former City of Sorcery … Shiznautmy… I guess you could call it…the ‘Master Key’…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Eehh!!??』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar, who was beside me, was astonished with a stern expression, sterner than when Paripi declared himself my subordinate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Paripi… this…… this man… what was that? The deepest part of the ruins? The master key? … exists …? I never imagined there was one… but where…… no, in the first place how did Paripi…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The City of Sorcery? Shiznautmy was certainly Sadiz’s… and…… Master Key?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t have it on me right now, but… if you let me go… I’ll arrange to have it sent back to Earth… and we’ll call it a day… can’t we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… this puny…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know what they’re talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, from Tre’ainar’s reaction, I can tell that it is very important.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiha… well, that’s the way it is. Okay, Coman. So, can you carry me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, m… me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi’s instructions flew to Coman. By “carry” he meant to take Paripi in this state and run away with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu!? Child, the little girl is moving! Do not allow their escape yet!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, Coman, don’t do anything foolish!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since we haven’t reached a conclusion yet, we can’t afford to let them go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Uu~nh… that… carrying you… I…… I’m not that strong… and Earth, is staring at me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll leave it to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite receiving Paripi’s orders, Coman had a slightly troubled expression on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… then… your whole body is heavy… so I’ll only carry… your head.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah? …… eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, let’s tear it off. Heave-ho.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Coman let out a sigh and grabbed Paripi’s head… HEY!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here~, we~, go~, heave-ho.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wai hold on! Coma, h, heeey!? Gugyuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiu! Oh, please don’t scream so loud… it’s scary… yes, the flesh is tough too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The demon’s cry of pain reverberated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, obviously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, C, Coman!? What are you doing?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ridiculous…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hii!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Ahhhhhh
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were too stunned and gasped at the sight that was happening in front of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron’s face almost turned blue at the sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, she would rather be spared, something like this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heave… ugh, tearing this off is difficult… uh~n.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hogyaaaaah! Just, w, wait, t, that I’m gonna die, Imgonnadie!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I can’t carry you with my physique and strength, so… I thought I’d just take you from the neck up… that can work, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe if only my brain was safe! But I’ve never done that before… wai, yo, you’re kidding me, wait a minute! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi, who took my Great Magic Spiral head-on, was in a state where his torso, neck, and limbs were barely connected by flesh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Grabbing Paripi’s head with both hands, Coman was trying to rip him apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the cries of the demon, but blood also splattered around like a fountain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nerves and flesh were torn apart, and the sight is so grotesque that it makes me want to vomit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no… my skirt got dirty… ugh… I just bought this… guh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She looked like a feeble girl crying because she’s covered in mud and soiled her freshly-made clothes, but in reality, it was the scene of a feeble girl bathed in blood while trying to rip someone’s head off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that sadness was not about the deed she was doing, but about the fact that her clothes were getting ruined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, there… I got it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ga … gah… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was terrified of Paripi who joyfully kicked people around and beat us up, but this also scared me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… hey, Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t stare so hard at me… if this person can become Earth’s subordinate, then I’m already your property… right? So…… just let me go this once…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coman’s face was filled with a sense of accomplishment, as if she had pulled out a turnip that couldn’t be pulled out… she grabbed Paripi’s severed head with both hands, but her hands were stained with blood, and at her feet was a puddle of blood still flowing from the head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her eyes watered and she pleaded with me with a maiden expression… looking at just her face you would think she was “cute”, but now I felt nothing but fear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, my legs were cowering now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The woman in front of me should be weaker than me if we fought…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… this…… hurts and it’s not even on the level of pain~…… Coman… even though I will be restored to normal… I wonder how long it will take… joining up with Earth… it’s going to take quite a long time…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m sorry… I…… I’ve never done anything like this before… I might have messed it up…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next time… I have to scold that Koaso… what’s with his daughter…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good… this woman… and these guys… are dangerous……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi, who was only a severed head, was talking, but I couldn’t get my head around it at all. I mean, he’s still alive in that state…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman… y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s the matter? Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you … really…… Coman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s no wonder the princess, who had been speechless so far, asked the question with a shudder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Are you still asking me that? I’m going to get angry, you know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But this is the last time… I won’t do anything to you, because this is goodbye. Now that my role is done and I have taken up another, I’m not interested in you anymore…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, the Coman up until now has been an imposter, to the point where it can’t be accepted if told that this was her genuine self.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while we were at a loss for words at Coman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goodbye Princess, Fu, Rebal, and… I’ll see you later, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Subsonic Song】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words of farewell to the princess’ group.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words that implied a future reunion with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Coman sprang from the place at high speed with Paripi’s head in her arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t expect Coman to be that fast, and I was completely slow to react.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, we were in the sky. There was no escape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, this is Paripi, so he must have some way to get back to the Surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If they could escape to the Surface like this, I wouldn’t really be able to catch them anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, we remained standing there for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
