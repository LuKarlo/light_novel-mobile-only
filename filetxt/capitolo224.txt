<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The crumbling town was in the midst of reconstruction work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The residents of the country worked together to remove rubble and build temporary houses while taking care of the wounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I set foot in such a town, I sat down beside a collapsed building that was originally a church and listened to the story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was about Earth and Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~, you were training with Earth~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two had come to Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, to be precise, they were brought here. By ‘her’ hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They couldn’t escape because of the barrier, they had been held captive by ‘her’ the whole time… was what I thought at first, but from what I’m hearing, that didn’t seem to be the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth and Sadiz were “brought here”, but not “held captive”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They lived with the people of this country and then…… a lot of things… seriously, all sorts…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, he lit a fire in our hearts… inspired us when we were hanging our heads in the midst of this unfortunate reality.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What was Earth doing in this country? How did he spend his time? What did the people of this country think of him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what I learned from the Mortriage crew, who claim to be friends of Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, he’s a really great guy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When we saw that Earth was working so hard, we thought we should do our best too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh… when he won the tournament, we were so happy, as if we were the winners…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These young men spoke proudly, as if they were bragging about their friends with straight, beaming eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un, Amae’s Older brother, so cool!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… you like Earth… you’re fond of your Older brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the cute little girl named Amae was puffing out her chest with pride.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a parent, I’m proud that it’s all actually about Earth, but at the same time, I’m also frustrated at my own stupidity for not being there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After leaving the Imperial City, out of our reach, he lived resiliently and strong, and in this way he has built new connections with his own power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered what would happen when I heard that Jamdi’el had taken Earth away, but things weren’t particularly bad here, but rather he worked hard with his friends and seemed to be adored by many people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think he would even have a little sister before I knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought he was still just an immature kid that I, Mamu, and Sadiz had to watch over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in reality, neither Mamu nor I had been paying attention to him at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So we didn’t notice anything important, we didn’t know him, we didn’t understand him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… what was I really doing… I…… and what’s going on with him right now? Hey? God.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the grounds of the church, where Earth had been staying for a while, I heard about what had happened to me from Earth’s friends, and with mixed feelings, I chuckled and muttered to the only statue in the church that remained intact, of the one they called “God”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a little “heaped up” there, but its face is definitely that of our former nemesis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth used your power and made a fuss about it… thanks to that, Earth got disappointed in us, rebelled against us, and then arrived at this place… haha… just what’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cacretale was not a member state of the Union, but a closed-door country with little information coming out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, during the war, there was no doubt to the suspicions that it was connected to the Demon King’s army, so they were kept under surveillance, but in the end, nothing related to Cacretale appeared on the stage even in the war. The war ended, and it was as if nothing had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell is going on… the country was presided over by the High Priestess, who overthrew the regime more than a decade ago… her name is Jamdi’el… and…… the symbol of this was a goddess named Kron … a goddess of divine blood, and she’ll be the wife of Earth, the winner of a recent tournament…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s the matter, Earth’s dad?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Ah, nothing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar. What the hell did your Demon Army do to Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el. If you haven’t come out in the open in over a decade, what do you want to do with Earth now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how Earth was able to use Tre’ainar’s skills. The suspicion that Earth may have ties to the remnants of the Demon Army has not yet been cleared in the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then this would be…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, they are now above the clouds in the sky?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, along with everyone to rescue the abducted High Priestess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now they’re raiding the Heavenly World… I mean, the Heavenly World really existed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I guess Jamdi’el was that kind of race.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, to rescue Jamdi’el by joining forces with human friends… or… no good. Damn, I can’t get my head straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Those people in the sky are cowardly… they attacked when the High Priestess was in tatters after she lost a fight with Earth… damn, I’m pissed off just thinking about it. Oraaa!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth was also exhausted, and there was nothing he could do about it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But this time, Earth is in perfect condition, as well as Mr. Machio, the Goddess, Ms. Sadiz and the others. I’m sure they’ll save the High Priestess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s what I thought the most, “Seriously?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Earth got into a fight with Jamdi’el and won… really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it has been more than ten years since the previous war, I know the strength of the Six Supremacy best of all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We fought many times, was devastated, and lost many comrades.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hakuki nearly killed me on many occasions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda was just so big in every way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 La’iphant had pride despite being an enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was terrifying and scary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to make Norja an enemy again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t even want to remember Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although there are differences in power and fighting styles, all six of them were still strong and dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as we could tell from the Graduation Match, Earth was much stronger than Mamu and I could have imagined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, with the strength he had three months ago, he was still not strong enough to fight against the Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, he won? Even if he played some tricks, the Six Supremacy were not so naive that he could manage with just such measures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, Earth was currently strong enough to fight against the Six Supremacy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… what happened to you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t believe just how much I don’t understand about my beloved son… how many times have I called myself unworthy as a father…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un… what’s wrong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I pounded on my head like that, Earth’s little sister peeked in on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so worried, even this kid saw it on my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, uncle… is worried about your Older brother… I’m anxious… what they’re doing up in the sky…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother? Don’t worry about Older brother!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In any case, even if it was true that they were now in the Heavenly World, honestly, neither I nor Mamu could use flight magic, so at this point in time, there was no way to go there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even if I knew where they were, we couldn’t rush to their aid right away, and I wondered what to do, but the girl named Amae, was excited…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother, he’s strong! Uncle is with them! There’s Big Sis too! Everyone is coming back! Older brother, we’ll play a lot when he comes back! He promised! Amae cheered him on a lot, so we would play a lot as a reward!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s so confident… no, I was stunned by the words of the innocent child who believed so much in him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh. I see…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, well… then I guess you’re right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes…… I see… I don’t know or understand “the Current Earth” better than this kid…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother, because Amae cheers him on, he won the championship, so it’s okay! This, is proof!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? …… nuoh, th that is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Older brother won this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Amae toddled off and pulled something out of the rubble and pointed it at me with a giggle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was shocked again when I saw it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, this is… th, the championship trophy or… Haha, you know right away who designed it, but… this is what Earth received as the championship trophy… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If no one else had been here, I might have been sprawled out when I saw the trophy my son had won.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a hateful thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A golden statue in the image of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar, with wings growing from his back, his left hand on his hip, his right leg resting on a square platform, his right index finger pointing toward the heavens, and a crown on his head…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha … haha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m already laughing in dismay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey? Tre’ainar. Are you watching this in hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this is your revenge on me, there’s no better one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiro~, I’ve managed to calm things down here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… What’s that gaudy! …… T, Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha… it’s like our dear son’s trophy, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Mamu ran up to me as I was smiling at the Tre’ainar trophy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, Mamu seemed surprised by the Tre’ainar trophy as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, how was he? That young man, José?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Oh, yes. He has quite severely damaged the magic holes, nerves, and muscles all over his body. The side effects of the drugs have almost crippled him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… then?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. I did some treatment on my part, and then I extracted the drug that was still in his body. But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s difficult to cure completely… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe. From now on, with proper rest, he’ll be able to recover enough to go about his daily life, but… I don’t think he can be a mage or a warrior anymore…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we set foot in this country, and were feeling distressed at the sight of the devastation and the memories of the war, we found a young man being nursed by a group of girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The young man, who would be almost the same age as Earth, was in a rather dangerous condition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And that, too… I guess it’s Jamdi’el’s doing… damn her…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only about Earth, the Mortriage crew also told me about the current Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that the people of this country are so endeared to her that they want to risk their lives to help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, behind the scenes, he was still a young man of the same age as Earth… in that case, I really can’t forgive her…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The drug… I won’t know without analyzing it in detail, but… it looked a bit like what the worst demon of the Six Supremacy once tried to spread…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Paripi… well, let’s not talk about that guy… he’s already dead.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s right. I get goosebumps just hearing the name. Anyway, that’s the worst kind of drug.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understand Mamu’s disgusted look just by remembering it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Jamdi’el had such a drug…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth… they said he went to help Jamdi’el with the people of this country. He wasn’t brainwashed or threatened, it was at his own volition.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, and with Sadiz. I’m sure there must be a reason…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was a dangerous person and currently one of the world’s highest bounty heads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as she is found, she is to be secured immediately. Dead or Alive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No mercy is necessary. In fact, she was about to turn a young man with a future into a cripple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what the circumstances were, there was no way we could forgive her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But neither Mamu nor I had an easy answer to what to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the more we listened, the more we realized that we don’t know anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We didn’t know anything about him, that’s why Earth was disappointed in us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
