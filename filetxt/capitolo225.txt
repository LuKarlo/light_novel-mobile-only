 “They’re gone…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You let them flee…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi and Coman got away, and I was still stunned, unable to sort my mind out for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If they had simply run away, it would still be fine. I would have been able to quickly switch gears and chase after them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Paripi’s declaration to be my subordinate and Coman’s abnormal behavior didn’t let me do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…… erm…… are you okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Looks like they really got away… Honey, how are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On either side of me, two women peeked anxiously at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Gyuu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Full of scratches… but…… this hand saved us. Thank you, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Kron smiled as she gently squeezed my hand, maybe she’s trying to heal me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m a little nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey!? Honey… I’ll take care of it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu stuck to me with medical tools, as if not to lose to Kron like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s kind of embarrassing… but…… I think I’ve calmed down a bit…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, u, ugh … tsu … urgh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, the princess was groaning with sadness and frustration… I guess… she might still be shocked about Coman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh yes… this is not the time to do this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron… Shinobu… y, yes… I’m fine, but… ah, yes… we gotta patch everyone up… can you do that for me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, of course.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Leave it to me, Honey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was stunned to see the two of them, and finally turned around and looked at my surroundings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone who had been wounded in the battle against Paripi was still lying down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even those who had been hit with a single blow by Paripi, but Mr. Machio and the others had been beaten up pretty severely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my suggestion, both Kron and Shinobu nodded and immediately ran off to join everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… h, hey… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess and the others were in an awkward mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, isn’t that reasonable?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They have gone through a lot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They came to the Heavenly World and helped out without understanding the situation, but they were defeated by Paripi, and betrayed by our old friend Coman, who then escaped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And me and these guys are still apart…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now… this is good enough for now, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, we had been fighting together without giving too much about the details.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So they still don’t know anything about what I did in the Graduation Match, and why I’m still in the Heavenly World, about Jamdi’el, about Kron, and about Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this situation, the problem of Paripi and Coman also came up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess… there are a lot of injured people, and Little man is right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz… tsu…… yes … that’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sensing my thoughts and the awkward atmosphere, Sadiz tells the princess, “Soon”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess wasn’t convinced of everything, but she couldn’t help but nod with a conflicted expression on her face as everyone in front of her was lying covered in wounds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can use my healing magic to a certain extent, I’ll help you. Please assist us, Fu. Rebal, carry the fallen ones.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least now I could put off talking for a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I don’t know what to talk about or what to do about Paripi and Coman, and I don’t have it all together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio, are you alright, it looked like he got your eyes or something, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah… it takes time for the eye to heal, but… well, it’s not life-threatening.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll help carry everyone… but still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That was too strong a foe … the world is… wide…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Mr. Machio, who fought me tooth and nail in the tournament, could barely get up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Sadiz was still dragging her heavy body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not sure what to expect from the rest of the team.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I was a little surprised at myself for being able to fight off Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『After Jamdi’el, Paripi … tis complicated, but… for now, you may take pride your victory.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed to be enough for Tre’ainar to accept it… the battle ended with a lot of confusion, but that alone might have been of great value to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt the presence of a crowd of people rushing in from outside the building.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I turned around, the palace door opened with a mighty bang.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince, we have arrived!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Prince! What in heavens… is that, Heavenly King!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, these guys… were there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraphs who had been waiting outside the palace rushed in all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, the Heavenly King couldn’t let them in as a measure against Kron’s Daybreak Eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I telepathically called for them…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, the prince muttered as he limped forward from my side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “His Majesty, what in heavens is this!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Intruders, it cannot be thee…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My Prince, thy face is scarred! Thou scoundrels!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing their bald King with his belly blown off and the bloody and swollen cheeks of the prince, the Seraphs were about to attack us in a murderous rage, but they were stopped by the prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Silence! I will allow no harm upon them!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, they’re intruders, but… at the same time, they are also the benefactors who saved this Heavenly World… it was by their actions that I became aware of the Paripi conspiracy that none of us realized, and they protected us from his evil hands…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of the prince, who had been watching everything so far, startled the Seraphs to the point where everyone was speechless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Paripi… but? Prince, what does that mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll explain later, but first, we must urgently treat Dad… His Majesty… and the injured benefactors who saved our country!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At once!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Understood!'”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In retrospect, I was relieved to think that if the Prince had not been here, things would have gotten messy again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Looks like you read the air, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No more … I can’t expose more of my shame…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince replied, biting his lip at my sarcasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure the guy had been through a lot of shock all this time… honestly speaking, this guy’s cheek was wounded, and I did hit his torso.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pucker up, it’s not on you… it’s by your Dad’s orders…… he was deceived… well, in the end, it’s all Paripi’s evil schemes, so I guess it’s not like you’re at fault.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I disagree. Followed my father’s orders I did, heeded Paripi’s words… all of it… simply…… because of my desire to be recognized… I was blinded.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You wanted to be recognized… Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… but no more. I need not …… speak of it anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, sure.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know if it’ll be enough to thank thee, but… the Jamdi’el case… I’ll take care of it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s right. Then we don’t need to go wild any more, do we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, with Kron’s abilities, I was able to see the bald guy’s past and catch a glimpse of what had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the delicate relationship between him and the bald guy, and what he himself wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - What? Do you want your father’s approval?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed even more now that I couldn’t say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Parents… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I remembered something. Or rather, I realized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Ah, what, Earth. D, do you want to talk to me? Um, w, what is it? Can you tell me what’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I called out to the princess, who was working on the treatment, she suddenly looked up in panic and bit it down quickly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, rather than the circumstances… you guys came here, but… erm…… what are my parents doing? Mother was in Cantidan… if Fu had learned space transfer, she would have come with you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, yes, that’s… that, umm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps it wasn’t what she had expected, but the princess shrugged her shoulders slightly, but quickly looked up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After you and Sadiz disappeared in Cantidan… Lady Mamu detected the presence Jamdi’el of the Six Supremacy… after that, your friend Bro, the half-demon… he wouldn’t say anything about it. But After looking into his background, we found out that he was from Cacretale… and also had a connection with Jamdi’el, so it was suggested that you might be in Cacretale.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Kron and Mr. Machio reacted to Bro’s name, but the princess continued regardless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “However, Cacretale is a closed country. And because of some political situation, we were excluded from the investigation team to Cacretale, and furthermore, Cacretale was covered by a barrier the next day, so we couldn’t even get ashore… we weren’t just waiting with our fingers crossed, but we couldn’t do anything about it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see…… So, when Fu mastered space transfer magic in the last few months… isn’t space transfer somewhat forbidden? Jamdi’el was using it in an assortment of ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, but he can learn it, after all Fu is… Huh? What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Investigation team to Cacretale?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, a word that the princess uttered caught my attention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cacretale Investigation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, my parents knew I was in Cacretale. Or rather, they suspected it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, they couldn’t get inside because of Jamdi’el’s barrier, so until now… what? But now the barrier…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, Jamdi’el was trapped here in the Heavenly World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So there was no longer a barrier around Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if my parents were keeping an eye near Cacretale? What if they found out that there is no barrier now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? If that’s the case, if I go back like this… or rather if Kron and Jamdi’el also return to Cacretale, wouldn’t there be trouble?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My private life has been taken care of. End-of-term work, relocation turmoil, promotion exams, Volume 2 work, bonus SS work, etc… I’m seriously tired. In addition, I was tired because the contents of the second volume were quite a bit different from the web version.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sorry if the late update caused a lot of worries about whether I was arrested naked, with the flu or the virus, or if I succeeded in marrying and became a full-fledged person.
