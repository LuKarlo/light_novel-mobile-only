 “Watch thy step, boys. And thou beautiful ladies as well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This spiral corridor seemed to go on forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The further down we go, the deeper the darkness becomes, but at the same time, you can feel the fierce miasma from deep within.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They said that she had been confined and prevented from using magic, but even so, anyone can see that the person in the depths of this place has tremendous power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that person was what we are here for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince was guiding us. Followed by me and Kron. Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A few months ago, it was only for a moment, but … feeling it again… this much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I feel such an eerie aura…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe it… I haven’t seen her, but I can tell from this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m scared, Honey. I’m not good with darkness, so can I stick with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’ group followed, sweating from the pressure that “she” was exerting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only Shinobu was still the same, but… don’t lie about being afraid of the dark. That was so monotone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… erm…… behind this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded to the princess, who had a worried look on her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did we come to the Heavenly World in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason for all of this is to save the woman trapped in this depths.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it seems that the princess and the others had encountered her a few months ago, though only for a brief moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh …… you’re captured, but you’re still …… the same…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, we arrived at the deepest prison.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There she was, chained with her eyes blindfolded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that she could not use magic, but she still felt so oppressive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? This presence… eh, Lady Kron!? Lady Kron’s presence! As well as…… Earth Lagann!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even with your eyes hidden, can you still tell?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was the captive Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as we got closer, she perceived Kron and I and reacted in surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el! Thank God, you’re safe… I’m glad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron… how…… art thou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why were we here? A natural question for Yamidire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, the princess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is… the Six Supremacy, Jamdi’el…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That much… she’s trapped in a magical seal… and yet like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Similar to Paripi… she’s on a different level…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even in such a state, Jamdi’el were so overwhelming that they could see the difference in power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve heard that this country has been attacked… even so, Lady Kron… but, Lady Kron… why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… do I have to tell you? Of course we’re here to help you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Earth Lagann! Thou… is it thy doing?! Did thou entice Lady Kron?! To allow Lady Kron to be so reckless for my sake… and forget your mission to be a bonded couple(Man and Wife) with Lady Kron and create the next generation of God?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el’s anger is directed at me… But, wait a minute―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Ah… Earth and… couple!? Cococo, oooooooh couple……!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… oh my …… really…… there are so many obstacles to my union with Honey… though that’s what makes our love burn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Princess, I’m too surprised. I mean, read the air already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu… she’s still the same Shinobu as ever, and I laughed bitterly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, Jamdi’el, Earth did not entice me. I came here by my own will and everyone else by theirs. I asked Earth to do this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, ah… does thou mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wanted to help you… and Earth heard my wish and granted it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seemed to think that I had tricked Kron into bringing me here, and Jamdi’el seemed puzzled by Kron’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well rather, I’m not in this situation out of a sense of duty, I didn’t come to help you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth Lagann…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a tearful wish…… from a girl who fell in love with me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, she was the woman who originally kidnapped me and made trouble for me, or rather, who was originally my enemy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So there’s no way I would come here of my own volition. I stressed that I only came because Kron asked me to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L, love… a woman’s wish… a… ah… Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like I said, princess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el, I do not know what you have done in the past… what have you been doing recently… what you intended to do… I don’t know what kind of sin you have committed. But…… I can’t lie about my feelings. You…… I don’t want to lose it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not just me, Tsukshi, Karui, Machio, everyone in the dojo… and the same goes for the townsfolk. That’s why Earth has lent us his strength.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was blindfolded and could not see Kron’s current appearance or facial features.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, the strong will that overflows from her voice is transmitted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Lady Kron… in but a few days… what in the world… just what in the world…… happened that thou became…… so mature…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufu, I am happy to hear you say so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Kron had grown up, Jamdi’el couldn’t hide her surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth… it’s about time you told us already. Why is the Six Supremacy, Jamdi’el… and also, this demon named Kron ―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess. It’s still not a good time, okay? Let’s read the air for now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, ah, I, I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No, don’t be like that. If you’ll just keep quiet a little longer, that’ll be fine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a nice atmosphere, so I told the princess to shut up, and she shrank back with a terrible look of nervousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? I was a little worried, but was the princess so mentally weak?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… well actually, that’s for the best…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… that was…… kinda awful…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll read as much air as you want, Honey… saying that makes me seem like I can’t read the air, I’ll just stay quiet for a while.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what’s up with these guys… well, it’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait… Earth Lagann… that thou have come this far… was thou victorious? Hey, Dictator’s child is here as well!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el, who was looking deeply impressed with the grown-up Kron, noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Jamdi’el asked this, the prince nodded and stepped forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed. It is I who led them here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What in the world happened? And… what about that man? Oh, the lowest filth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, she’s worried about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Paripi escaped, though quite seriously wounded.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This boy… Earth Lagann, defeated him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Jamdi’el also knew that Paripi was here, and that was why she was most surprised to hear that Paripi had lost to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “F, foolish! Though rotten, he is Six Supremacy! For that Paripi? Earth Lagann… thou… thou art the victor?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Foolish, he is not someone thou can handle with trick as thou did against me … but being that thou truly stands here… foolish…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el knew Paripi’s strength better than anyone else here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why she can’t believe it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it’s a fact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why the Prince brought us here… he owes us a debt of gratitude…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… what…… does that mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… he’ll let you out of here, too… but…… with some very strict conditions…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… let me out!? M, me? Ridiculous! No matter what, the plebeians of Angela Kingdom would never allow it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. Because I did that much, the prince broke various matters concerning Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there are some very last minute conditions, and I’m not sure if she’ll take them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The runes sealing thy magick… will never be removed… henceforth, thou be unable to use thy magic eyes or any magick whatsoever… that is the condition.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This can only be released here in the Heavenly World. And thou… will never again set foot in this country… a permanent banishment. That’s the condition of thy release.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, of course she won’t accept these conditions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, what if the goddess tells her to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, considering my parents, is it really a good thing or a bad thing for Jamdi’el to lose her powers… in addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hihahahaha, that’s right SIS~ ♪]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh-oh, from the magic crystal in my pocket that I wanted to throw away, but hadn’t thrown away yet, I heard a nauseating voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el stiffened with her mouth open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hello again, Sis, It’s Earth Lagann’s right-hand man and top subordinate, Paripi.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Oh… eh? …… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Also Earth. Thanks for earlier. So, I immediately got a report from my man in the Empire … ‘Koaso’. You know, Coman’s parent. Want to hear~? You want to hear it, don’t you? I’m clever, right? Can you tell ‘him’… Praise me~?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was still in bewilderment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this… let’s get rid of it… that’s when I brandished the magic crystal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Your mom and dad are somewhere in the waters near Cacretale… they may have already sneaked ashore?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I know… disconnecting now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oh~, wait, wait, wait~, we also gotta talk about your ‘friend’~]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t expect to hear from someone who was worse at reading the air than even the princess so soon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe it’s because the evaluation system has changed, but somehow I have gotten into the ranking again, and I am excited to get drills all at once. Volume 2 will be released next week. And in the near future, the information on comicalization will be released. I want to give up on marriage for a while and try my best at novels again, so thank you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, the ban on the Volume 2 illustration has already been lifted in various places, and I think that you can confirm the appearance of Shinobu and Bro, so please look for it if you are interested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
