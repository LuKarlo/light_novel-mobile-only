 Even a woman like Jamdi’el was surprised by this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Paripi… h, ey, hold on… Earth Lagann’s… subordinate?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [That’s right, Sis. I’m his man now!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What art thou planning? What art thy intentions with Earth Lagann, with Kron’s future partner?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [I’ve changed my mind. Yes, starting today!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such mockery! I’ll never accept such a thing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, even I don’t recognize Paripi as a subordinate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m not so sure that’s what Jamdi’el was trying to say…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, it’s like a parent who doesn’t approve of their child’s marriage, Honey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W, why, is Jamdi’el of the Six Supremacy so attached to Earth…? I don’t know what’s going on anymore… a, a, and besides, p, partner…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why do these people take the liberty of talking about Little man… ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So the reaction around me was reasonable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu looked stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A confused princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I saw Sadiz with a conflicted expression, as if she thinks she has nothing more to say, my heart aches too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, that’s Sis for you Earth… when it comes to the boss, she can’t seem to notice anything else… No~ matter what.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Just like how excessive love, worship and devotion can cloud the truth… Well, that’s the way it is ♪.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi already has some idea of my secret. However, I have no intention of answering the question, and he doesn’t seem to be pursuing me either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el, on the other hand, was unaware of anything. About the existence of Tre’ainar in me, always by my side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi snickered at this, but without trying to show the meaning, which frustrated Jamdi’el even more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Well, boss. Let’s continue what we were talking about earlier…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Paripi! Don’t ignore me and move on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oh~, yeah yeah… Boss. This id… Sis is too noisy, can you please step away from her for a minute? Let’s talk in private.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since this was not going to get us anywhere, Paripi proposed a private talk with me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Screw you, I’ve got nothing to say to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I don’t want to talk to this guy, so I rejected the offer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Oh~, such a thing to say~, my boss~]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who’s the boss, stop messing around! Listen? I don’t want you――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Please, boss! It’s definitely useful information for the boss! If you don’t listen, I could slip up and reveal the boss’s favorite erotic book, ‘Pleasure Craze!’. The Busty Cool Big Sister Collecti―――]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uruaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was screaming to block out all sounds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But when I turned around, I could tell by everyone’s expression that it was already too late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… you’re a boy. But…… guh, big tits… no, if you give up, that’s where the bust ends. Even I have the potential for growth… but if push comes to shove, the Ninpo Arts for Breast Augmentation can…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t know! Sadiz, is that true? If Earth had had any naughty books, you were obligated to report them all to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My apologies. Certainly, that ero-book was hidden in a changing closet by Little man. However, because the genre was so convenient for me, I pretended to ignore it without disposing of it or reporting it to the princess… ahem ahem ahem… there’s nothing to criticize. Sadiz understands.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big… tits? Earth likes something called big tits?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu, while sighing, was patting her chest… that sullen expression… adora… ble…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do I put it, princess, what the hell! Why do you need to know about someone’s private life and hobbies!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I didn’t want to know at this place and time that Sadiz actually found me out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only one who doesn’t know better was Kron. Please grow up healthy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth Lagann… with Lady Kron it’s not about size, but beauty… did thou not bask at her beautiful breasts in the bath?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And you, don’t take it so seriously, Jamdi’el!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would this Dark Valkyrie counter it there!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I did see them! I can still remember them vividly due to 【Canonicon】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you say that here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Bask in the bath… eh?! You went in together… eh!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You see. Shinobu, who didn’t know that, would react.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the Princess, she has always been so vocal about this kind of thing. Come to think of it, when she heard that I took a bath with Sadiz when I was little, she was so upset that she started screaming…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I took a bath with Earth, didn’t I? I even wiped his body.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””………………””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Also, I saw Earth’s thingy, was it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey’s thingy!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s… even for me, the last time I saw it, when we took a bath together, we were five years old?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron, I beg you, will you shut up for a minute already!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this point, not only Shinobu and the princess, but also Fu and Rebal were looking at with terrible contempt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only Sadiz, who knew the situation, smiled wryly, but doesn’t seem to follow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no. I have to do something about this quickly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [By the way, that erotic book, along with twenty others, was provided by ‘Ouna Nyst’, who has transferred to a different school… isn’t that right? Coman dear.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 […… Yes…]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Coman! What the hell were you spying on?! I don’t want to see any of you bastards again, but the next time I see you, I’ll remember this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew I should’ve killed that fucking demon! If only Coman hadn’t interfered!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I didn’t realize that Coman knew what I was doing. Well, the actual number of books I got from Ouna was eighteen… I went straight home from the academy and carefully counted them, so no doubt about it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Yeah… in fact, to check the contents, Coman also went through those 20 erotic books during the break time at the academy before Earth took them home… and that was the first time for Coman, too, and before I knew it, she secretly kept two for he rarara, hokyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hey, Coman, wait, hey, I can’t see, I can’t see anything! Hey… you’re going to gouge my eyes out with your fingers… hey, it takes a long time to heal those!?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I heard Paripi scream. I couldn’t see him, but it seemed that something terribly horrifying has happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~ fine then… everyone… right. Hey guys, stay here for a moment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My spirit can’t take anymore… I’m going to talk to him alone for a bit…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want this guy revealing any more weird stuff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Holding the magic crystal, I walked away to a distance where no one could hear my conversation with Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… what is it, talk?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Hah~ hah~… er~, girls are scary, boss. You should watch out too.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get on with it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Ah, yeah. You know about――――――]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I got information from the devil, which I certainly needed, unfortunately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [―――――― so that’s it. Well, Cacretale was already governed and controlled by Sis… on the other hand, the old regime that stubbornly enforced the seclusion was destroyed by Sis, and above all, the attack by the Heavenly World has made it essential for Cacretale to receive reconstruction support from the outside world. There’s no way the Union… old man Mikado… or Hiro wouldn’t interfere. So Sis and Kron can’t go back to Cacretale anymore.]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I guess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [That’s why as soon as Coman’s parent… Koaso left the Empire, ‘he’ also went to work behind the scenes. If the release of Sis is on the condition of sealing her power, and she will become a mere woman out on the streets with Kron… why don’t you leave it to me… and “that guy” as a bodyguard?]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t immediately turn down the devil’s proposal, so I kept quiet and thought about it for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Overall rating 120,000 drills have cooooooome! Thank you, everyone, for the drill injection for the first time in a while. I realized that there were 880,000 drills left to reach the 1 million drill goal I had set in the past… or rather, I remembered. Thank you. Please continue to stab me with a thud from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, the schedule of the comicalization has been decided.

 It is scheduled to be released on the web next month, April 2.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I’m going to enjoy this as a reader just like you. While looking forward to that day, I will do what I have to do and will continue to do my best, so I look forward to your continued support.
