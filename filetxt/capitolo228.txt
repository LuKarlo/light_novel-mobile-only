 “Jamdi’el… I’m done talking to Paripi.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And back to the topic at hand. To get you out of here… they’re going to have to seal your power.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After talking to Paripi, I will talk to Jamdi’el again about the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, Jamdi’el gives me a jittery look… no, as her eyes are closed, was it even a jittery look?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth Lagann… how did thou get caught up with the dross like Paripi?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I didn’t get talked down to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No tongue is as calculating, deflective, or quick to falsehood and betrayal as his! After all, is it not by such a man that even the Heavenly World has come to this turbulent state?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s exactly right. Really, I can’t trust anyone like that at all, and I’m hesitant to take him up on his offer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why it’s so frustrating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t trust him and I don’t want to rely on him, but I have no other choice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you say about her?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… that’s?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I’m not the one who’s going to release this person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked Kron, who then puffed up her cheeks and scolded Jamdi’el in her cell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Enough, Jamdi’el! Don’t be selfish. Surely losing power may be unbearable for you. But at this rate… I…… I can’t be with you! That’s what I hate the most.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron… and yet…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t need any power… I…… I want to stay with Jamdi’el from now on. I want you by my side. Someday, if I have a baby with Earth, I want Jamdi’el to hold it too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, what Kron wanted was not Jamdi’el as the Six Supremacy, much less Jamdi’el as the High Priestess, but what she wanted was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “M, mothe… mo, ther… m… uh, mo…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, read the air, me… Honey would think that the woman who cringes here is annoying… just calmly count prime numbers… a child who will be born someday… the dream of Sakura as our daughter and Sasuke as our son. but only in my heart right now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A baby with Little man… even if it wasn’t me who gave birth… I’ll be the one to hold it… ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow the princess… she’s already so dizzyingly disheartened… I’m getting worried… or rather, she needs your support at a time like this, Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sorry for Shinobu’s upset attitude because I know how she feels. I mean, Sakura? Sasuke? What is that, don’t tell me you’ve already thought of your child’s name…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it seemed that Sadiz was saying something that can’t be ignored…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron… thy feelings are… however, I cannot simply accept the loss of my power.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jamdi’el!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There will be those who will target thee, Lady Kron. More and more will come to know the existence of the Daybreak Eye and its holder. At such times, without the power to protect thee even at the risk of my life … I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power of Jamdi’el. It’s not so much for herself, it’s all for Kron’s sake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To protect Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of her existence, Jamdi’el thinks that she cannot afford to lose her power in order to protect Kron who may be targeted by someone in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to Jamdi’el’s feelings, Kron …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I’ll get stronger! Rather, Jamdi’el, I will be strong enough to protect you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… y… yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, she said that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I will be so strong… that you will feel safe Jamdi’el… that you won’t have to risk your life for me. So please don’t say that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, Lady Kron, what art thou saying! What is truly important, what the world needs is Lady Kron! I cannot allow thee to protect me I’m afraid! Thou should never entertain such thoughts—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I need Jamdi’el, not the world! You, Jamdi’el! No matter what kind of life you lead and what kind of feelings you have for me… I want to stay with you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron would say this now that she was stronger and has grown in heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… Lady Kron, going so far for me or others…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, during this period, Jamdi’el was still saying this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s a really troublesome woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… just cut it out, Jamdi’el.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth Lagann… what do thou mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe it’s because of your own agenda that you’ve taken care of Kron so much, but… you should understand Kron’s feelings… other people’s feelings a little bit. It’s terrible to be too insensitive, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s so dense, Jamdi’el, and I―――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… You…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…… Earth(Little man)… “”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Why did master and all the princess’ group have faces there like, “Did you just say that?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, I’m not dense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood Kron and Shinobu’s feelings for me, and I’m facing them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s right, Jamdi’el. Please understand my feelings too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because… to me…… you’re the one who raised me… stayed with me my entire life… you’re my family—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be that Jamdi’el herself did not see things that way at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron was created out of her warped feelings for Tre’ainar, and Jamdi’el may have acted as a servant or loyal vassal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, Kron is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To me…you are… my…… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Kron tightly clenched her fists, a little hesitantly, a little embarrassed, and with tears slowly welling up in her eyes, trying to say something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― My true feelings… were full of what I really wanted to call her… there were so many… in the end, I couldn’t say anything!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were her thoughts from the moment Jamdi’el was taken away and a regretful Kron let them out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To say it, to say that, Kron has come this far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My… Mother…… so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wh… eh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the true feeling that Kron had for Jamdi’el all along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the world doesn’t allow it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince? What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it was the first I’m hearing of it… so…… I was surprised, but at the same time …… amused, though it was imprudent of me, I laughed, boy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was speechless with astonishment. The prince, who had been watching the whole thing, gave Kron a warm smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That girl… she’s a doll that’s been created… I was told as such, still it was wrong. No matter what others may think… for a child, a parent is a parent… they’re important… that girl… is no different from me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. Well, I guess everyone’s family situation is different, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps he was comparing Kron to his own feelings for his parents, or perhaps he would normally be surprised that a sinner like Jamdi’el would be called “mother”, but the prince seemed to rather sympathize with Kron and laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me…… I wonder what’s going on…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now, I’ll keep my word. If Jamdi’el loses her power… I swear on my life to ensure that the Heavenly World will never lay hands on her… not that we forgive Jamdi’el’s past sins, but… we are indebted to thee. We shall never get involved with these two again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… well, let them be.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, about thy future… should we return thee all to the island? Or instead… will thou ride back on the back of that odd faced dragon? If possible, I would have thought of a banquet, but this is no situation or atmosphere for such… my father is still unconscious, as well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who has yet to come to an agreement with me, asked me about the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is the Heavenly World. Even if we were to go back, it does not mean that I can easily go back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could have taken Hilua, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I want Hilua to send Kron and Jamdi’el to a certain place… and drop me off on the way there… everyone else can be sent back by you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Very well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The three of us… won’t we go back to Cacretale?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In any case, the problem with my parents has still not been solved… I mean, I don’t intend to do it myself… Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like I’m forgetting something…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if I had remembered that at this point, I might have explored different options.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I… in Cacretale on the Surface…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu~un♪ Cleaning, wiping… cleaning up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, how lovely! Are you cleaning up?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so busy thinking about the fact that my mother and father were coming, about Jamdi’el and Kron, about Paripi…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un! I’m a good girl! I have to help a lot! If I’m a good girl, everyone would come back soon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had completely forgotten about the little girl who was humming and waiting for “all” of us to come home
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Big Sister, uncle, goddess, high priestess… Older brother! I wonder if everyone will come back soon~♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’ve come to realize that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe I wasn’t qualified to complain about my parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m about to do the same thing――――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
