 Somehow or other, the conversation reached a resolution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whether Kron can continue to call Jamdi’el “Mother” or whether Jamdi’el accepts it will be a matter for both of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it was likely that Kron’s desire to stay with Jamdi’el will be heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All that’s left, is me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Paripi’s suggestion was that the future of Jamdi’el and Kron should be left to “that guy”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It might be much better than going back to the current Cacretale or throwing them both out into the middle of nowhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then what do I do next…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Shinobu and Sadiz stood in front of me with sad expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey, that means you’re not going home with everyone, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then… we’ll have to say goodbye here… don’t we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of them reaffirmed the meaning of my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, that’s how it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, that’s what we originally talked about back in Cacretale…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I had a faint hope that I would be able to help you out and make your troubles go away, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… well, it’s true that you being there was a great help to me Sadiz… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once, we even hugged each other in the Cacretale and said our goodbyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz didn’t say “rethink this” or “take me too” or anything like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if the Master and Madam were just a stone’s throw away… I’m on your side, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gently wrapping her hands around my cheeks, Sadiz said it again with tears in her eyes, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, one more hug.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, Little man… cuddling, on my springy boobs.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If it’s the current you, Little man, with the power and strength of your mind right now, I’ll push your back… if you return now… as a perk, you can have my tits, or do other Erotic Things, as much as you want~…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heeeeeeeeeeey!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing me off again… a hug for that… while saying that, Sadiz half-jokingly seduces me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seriously …… oh, tits …… erotic things… as much as I want… no matter how many times … no way?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that how it is… like that… ah, ahem, Honey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a little confused, Shinobu, who had been sneaking around for some time, grabbed my sleeve as Sadiz hugged me with a slightly smug expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I also… I really want to be with you, Honey… go on dates, eat together, make out, and have a big hustle tussle at night…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you know, I’m… on Honey’s side in any world or situation… there’s something meaningful about Honey leaving us and going off alone again, and as long as you want it, I, as a woman, won’t drag your feet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu likes me and really wants to stay with me, but she was trying her best to be a good listener and support me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Geez… really…… a waste of a good woman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” But you know what, I’d…… like a hug too… at least.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s all… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So when Shinobu asked me for a hug, I naturally accepted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I’ve been enjoying Sadiz’ tits, the way her body rubbed against mine and her scent… no, I wanted to hug her a little more, but I pulled away from Sadiz and spread my arms out to Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nmu, Little man… to shake off my boobs… he’s really mentally tough… after all, the next time will be raw rather than over clothes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz pouted her lips a little uncomfortably… ah~, damn, that face was cute too… I mean…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here, Shinobu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah ♡.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm… I’m grateful for all you’ve done for me this time around. You’ve been helping me a lot since Mr, Aka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… big, warm… wrapping me… ah, I resent my lack of vocabulary… Boso…… Space-Time Ninja Art 【Marking】 complete… Hehehe with this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu? What was that? You were whispering.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s nothing! Oh, hug me tighter, so hard that I break♡.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her body was smaller than I thought. Unlike Sadiz, it does not have the flesh of an adult woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, this little body has helped me out so many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, this girl…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufufu, everyone is getting along.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron! Such composure! I understand the future, but at least if thou delay in these situations, will others not gain an advantage over thee? In order to give birth to the future Son of Earth Lagann before anyone else, make the most of the opportunity here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that so? Oh… Mother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ahhhhh! I hear nothing. See here, we must hurry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nmmu, Jamdi’el, you’re so shy… ufufufu, but it’s okay~, because one day, I’ll have you accept me. For that reason, for now, I’ll be a good girl who listens to my parents! So, Earth~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron jumped on me and Shinobu’s hug while smiling, and hugged both me and Shinobu as if to envelope us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her expression was somewhat challenging, yet refreshing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Undoubtedly, when it comes to Jamdi’el, Kron was even more…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you! No matter how much you consider yourself a worthy rival and a friend, I need you to read the air here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I love Earth, too, so I want a big hug for myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, it’s the first time I’ve hugged a girl my age like this… but… I mean…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Honey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Nope…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s inappropriate at a time like this, but… now…… I… I thought I was in quite the popular phase… I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu, ga …… ah, gag …… nnngaah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “P, princess, f, fell, fell down… no way right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry for the trouble… normally I… would say that, but I’m so sorry I can’t do it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, something that looked like a mummy appeared at the edge of my field of vision… it was the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tte, u o~tsu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess cried tears of blood that she had never shown before…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, ah, uuuuh, uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, EEEEEAAAAAARTH!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, eh, wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, the princess, who was always crisp, cool and mature…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whyyy? Why are you being so mean to me? Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t tell me anything, and you just flirt with other girls in front of me as if to show off! There has to be a limit to the number of lovers one can have… but, buuuuuuuut!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally holding her head and crying like a little child… what’s wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tell me… as well… Earth…… tell me already! What happened, what happened to you, Earth! Tell me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I see…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So that’s how it is. She’s been treated coldly, and kept out of the loop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a childhood friend, it was discouraging to be treated like that and not to being told anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was also the whole thing with Coman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… naturally… I’m sorry, Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ewannn, ugh, gusu, higu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to tell them to some extent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the princess, to Fu, to Rebal… this time I was helped a lot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… all this time, didn’t you like me? You’ve always loved me, haven’t you!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? No, not really?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gusu… and yet, why with a woman I don’t know……………… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……… Hmm? Huh? What are you talking about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Uh oh~……”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why are Sadiz, Fu and Rebal all staring at me like “Oh no!”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Drats!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It makes me sad to see that in my recent career as a novelist, there is a trend of comeuppance and isolation against childhood friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Childhood friends are inherently precious. If connections between people are an asset in life, childhood friends are assets that can be obtained without difficulty, like a lottery ticket.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if they have the worst personality, if you have a connection to a childhood friend, you should cherish it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, take good care of your childhood friends. Don’t make your childhood friend cry. Don’t make them sad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>
