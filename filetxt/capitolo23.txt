 “Hey, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There you are…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was talking to Tre’ainar, Fu and Rebal seemed to notice me and came over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, it’s been a long time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been too long Earth! Well, you haven’t changed much, have you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I guess I’ve grown a little, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know he doesn’t mean much with the sarcasm, but starting our chat with ‘I haven’t changed much’, it felt like he was saying ‘I’m not growing’, still I just laughed and let it go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, even after all this time they’re still noisy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, is that so? Oh right, we’ll give out souvenirs afterward, be sure to take it home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, darn.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu tends to snuggle up to people with such a childish smile like a little kid, while Rebal won’t even approach unless he deems it necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Fu aside, Rebal has always been like this. He’s not a bad guy, but he’s always cold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, how was studying abroad?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it was a great learning experience! I was exposed to various magic, learned about those and about myself… It wasn’t easy, though. I also experienced an actual battle a little earlier.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It certainly was a hassle. Suddenly, a flock of wild fire dragons attacked where they were studying abroad, and we fought as temporary warriors.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I feel like they’re a little bit more boastful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, the people gathered around us and saying, “I want to hear, I want to hear!” The voice is raised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s right. But I didn’t think you would be back at this time. I thought you guys would return closer to the graduation ceremony.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was hoping to change the topic because I would just end up miserable if I listened to their bragging story, but Fu and Rebal turned to me with eyes glaring at my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to play in the games.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I as well, to prove my strength…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s going to come out, too, right? But maybe we’re already… I might as good if not better than Earth or the princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, but be prepared. We’ve gone through a real battle and we’re already leagues ahead of you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’ll be in the match. I thought it would be decided by whether or not I beat the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But these guys, too…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s amazing! Then, Fu and Rebal are participating.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The next match is a battle of the Seven Heroes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, I’ve been fired up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Imperial Capital, no, the world will be shocked when four children of the Heroes clash!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both of them will participate in the [Graduation Commemorative Match]. The classmates are excited about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the level of confidence that oozes out of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s an aura about them which convinced everyone ‘there’s no way they’re going to lose’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh ho, Fu. Come on, show us the power you’ve acquired in studying abroad! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I wanna see, wanna seeee!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you have this much confidence, naturally you have something worthy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the classmates get anxious to see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, here? Hmm, eh, so embarrassing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though Fu says ‘embarrassing’ with his mouth, he doesn’t seem to be against it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was a little annoying to me, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then… Yeah, you wanna see? 【Bit Fire】! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Fu, who is trying to show power to everyone in some way, sets fire to a tree at the edge of the exercise field.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bit Fire. It is elementary magic of the beginner level.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Among the magic ranks of Bit, Kilo and Mega, it is the weakest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Showing such magic now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eh?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the entire training ground was engulfed in flames. It seemed as if it had all gone ablaze for a flash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hnnn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The blaze of fire is a non-standard flame comparable to the Mega-class magic that instructors and others have shown in demonstrations before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was trembling at the scale and power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… That? Sorry…… It wasn’t too big a deal, so I guess it was disappointing? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a bewildered expression on his face, is this guy saying that was a mere trick!? The nerves on him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, not good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the first time I’ve ever been furious enough at Fu to want to hit him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””I’m so surprised!! “””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To release the highest level magic with the basic class spells.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How much has he grown in the past year?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if he did that using Mega class… This guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m surprised.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s about it, I’m so surprised… Then again, this is surprising……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys, they intentionally act unaware as I get the feeling like I’m being looked down on, so irritating!!!! [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. In the past year, both Fu and I have returned with absolute power.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re on our next stage. You can’t beat us now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal asserts that by my side who is at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have anything to say back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll win the championship this time. And the victory…I’ll dedicate it to that person.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the victory declaration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be clear, this is the first time that cool guy has said anything hot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s all I’m confident about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu! And it’s Rebal! You were back! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the princess appeared in such a thrilling exercise field.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu and Rebal ran to the princess as if they had been surprised, and on one knee bowed their heads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been a long time, Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you look good and all. Also this is a reunion of childhood friends, call me Phianse like you used to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, even to the princess, they were childhood friends. So she smiled happily and put her hand on their shoulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Phianse… No, Phianse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Rebal. You’re as handsome as ever. We both have heard rumors. You took the initiative to confront the fire dragon that struck the Kingdom of Chicava, got hailed as heroes, and even got the title of Dragon Slayer. I’m proud as a citizen of the Empire.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu shows a smile at the princess’s mention of their labor. On the other hand, Rebal has a stiff expression, but as if he had decided to do something…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse. I’ll win the next match. Fu and… you and… Earth as well, I won’t lose you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Muh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When I win, I will announce my candidacy as a prospect for your hand in marriage.” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, oh…… This guy has really changed in the past year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, with all the girls heads over heels for the guy, far from confessing his feelings to someone, is he actually declaring it in front of everyone first?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the girls who like him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””””Kyaaaaaaaa, amazing!! Rebal to the princess!? Lovely! “””””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I thought they would be shocked, they’re really making a lot of noise, these girls… Well, that’s fine, but… Now, how will the princess respond?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Are you serious?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m serious.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Serious feelings. Then, the princess also shows a serious face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Rebal… You are a childhood friend, a friend you can trust and respect. And you who make an effort with a desire to improve -“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I win, I swear to love you more than anyone else in the world, and I pledge we will continue to protect the peace of the Empire together!” [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know how you feel, Phianse. But I wish for a chance to be seen as a man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal conveys his feelings straight to the other party strongly, regardless of whether there are any people around him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Rebal… I…… I…umm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the princess also seems to be puzzled after being hit with such a strong feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t think I need to worry about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They seem to suit the blood of the heroes, and everyone would agree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I wish you happiness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Pathetic, this one… to proclaim victory…… Huh? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Hey, hey. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, who was watching the whole scene, spoke to me with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if Rebal saying, “I will win” was a slight against him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, don’t say it so easily. You saw Fu’s magic earlier, didn’t you? That was awesome… Even Rebal will have power of that level. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Irrelevant. After all, both are still at a level that can be achieved. Genius? In comparison, after all, it might as well be child’s play. In two months, they will be overwhelmed. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey! I can do that? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis possible. One year of study abroad? Yet all he did was beat a wild dragon? It seems the privilege being able to receive my guidance for two months is comparable to a hundred years worth of training. Once, I undoubtedly defeated the dragon king of the demon world. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I-it’s not reliable when you say it… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And then, that little one. Are you unaware he is merely pretending to use bit class magic to create a mega class output? Were I alive, Giga class… No, I would demonstrate power on the Tera class. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, wait a minute. What’s Giga or Tera? That’s what I heard, right? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After understanding the extent of Fu and Rebal’s power, Tre’ainar asserts that “I am the winner”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Believe in me. Whose disciple do you think you are? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strangely, I felt the power in those words, and I felt my depression soothing immediately as my spirit was rising.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Anyway, tis you who will win the championship. However, in order to do that, you will also take on some risks. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Risk? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Risk. Is there a side effect or something? Certainly, if you beat that level in two months, it’ll be physical or to my life-span.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『From now on, you must make your own declaration. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What? Declaration? Eh, what’s the risk…… What’s that? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you sure? Well-』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The risk involved isn’t physical or to my life-span…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal, I’m happy and proud of your feelings. But I’m going to participate in the next match… and circumstances with him… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know. That’s why I’m back! Before that declaration is made! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While Tre’ainar and I were talking, I felt a scene unfolding like a love story between a swordsman and a princess, but there I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Rebal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, E-E-Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I knew I was in their way, I opened my mouth and carried out what Tre’ainar said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words with no basis now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was convinced by Tre’ainar’s words that the risk was necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s about pushing yourself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I agree, and declare it quite embarrassingly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know you guys are strong, but… I’m the one who will win! There’s something I can’t give up either! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Heh? E-Earth? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This declaration of mine would be one that ignores the current mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared to Rebal’s reason for fighting, I just want Sadiz’s boobs and to show off my cool side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, since we decided to win the championship, Tre’ainar said that we should not back down here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After such big talk, it’ll be humiliating if I lose. It was Tre’ainar’s idea to bear that level of risk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh I see… Earth. That’s how you feel. Is that what you’re talking about? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I guess I may not be able to compete with you now, but… but I have a reason to win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal came in front of me are we stared at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Kyaaa! Th-Th-This is it! Kyaaa!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A-Amazing! So that’s what it’s all about, that Earth… I don’t want Rebal to win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, that’s what it was… Earth. Umm, which one do I cheer for?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? That? What? I thought I’d be criticized, but suddenly the girls were making a lot of noise, and the men were excited?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, uh, wow, wow, Earth… that Earth declared victory… Oh, so much about me… I’m not going to give it to you. “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, the princess who is in the way of the confession is saying something, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahawaha is getting interesting. Verily. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar is my master, and while he made me declare it, he seemed very amused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
