<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, this was just as surprising as the declaration that Paripi would be my subordinate or Coman showing her true nature.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, after pushing that attitude of disliking and condescending me to the fullest, there must be something wrong with my thought circuit if I believed the princess liked me, so why was she surprised the moment I said that she was wrong? Rather, I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, ah, …… eh? E, Earth… t, that… eh… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, what are you talking about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh~, what are you saying, Earth! W, who, then, who have you been looking at, if you don’t like me?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fugah’!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I answered in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no, she’s right here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Li, ttle man… ohohohohoho, so precious.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, guh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goodness, Li, tle, ma, Little maaaaaaaaan… r, really. Well, I, I knew, but hey. Who was Little man looking at~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh~ … gu, ka, don’t tease me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~?! Fufu, ohohohoho…… bosu… guh, even though I knew, this reaction… the strength to defeat a Six Supremacy, even though his body and mind have grown, this innocent reaction… utterly adorable… I want to eat him up… Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s thoughts were leaking out of her mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that was probably a bit of teasing, and Sadiz would laugh with a cool expression as a ‘grown-up’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I couldn’t bear that laugh, so I turned my back and my shoulders were trembling with excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, so embarrassing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm… That? What is it…… now…… my chest feels queasy…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron, it’s a disease… The Love Sickness… thou, Earth Lagann. That’s why, thou should have bedded Lady Kron as soon as possible…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, uh, w, well, I knew she was Honey’s first love, but… I still get jealous when it is mentioned in front of me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, even though I did it unconsciously, it can’t be smart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was Jamdi’el so angry that she gave off a menacing aura?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron tilted her head sadly, not knowing what the pain in her chest was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Shinobu, who didn’t come forward, still looked frustrated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “M, my bad… Kron…… Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, I’m…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that, that… I mean, I should not say that in front of you guys who told me that you like me… that wasn’t considerate of me… I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. To the two people who were in love with me, I haven’t given a clear answer yet, and they’ve still done something like risk their lives for me, and this is what I do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think I’m doing the worst thing possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Kyu~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Kron nodded as if he had something in her heart, and Shinobu turned bright red in the face and began to moan, “awawa”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see…… my chest, which had been tightened…… fluttered just now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I am overjoyed and saddened by your words… is this what love is? I learned one more thing that I liked today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ehehe, I’m glad I learned from you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dazzling!? This Goddess…… oh, no, such a dazzling smile, I stood there for a moment…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey, you really are …… a dork, aren’t you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh? … wh… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My love is not so weak …… as to be broken by this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now… you understand my feelings… and that’s enough. Because the rest is up to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My cheeks, hot, as a squirming and embarrassed Shinobu plucked my sleeve with her fingers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I wonder what it is… already……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s how it is ♡.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, I’ve only ever directed my feelings of liking a girl to Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And because Sadiz was also a perfect superhuman in every sense, she was beautiful, smart, strong, tough but sometimes sweet and sexy, so I honestly didn’t think anything of the girls around me at the academy or the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But by going out into the outside world for a bit and broadening my horizons…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, look. Let’s take Jamdi’el out and get going right away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Earth, ufufu~, he’s so shy~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufu~, are you already embarrassed, Honey? Ara ara!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not embarrassed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh dear, is that so~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is a nice development. Can we attack now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t give you an answer yet, but… it’s just that…… I also have some kind of sweet and sour, but also warm feeling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “WIIIIIIIL YOOOOOOU STOOOOOOOP INGNORING MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Ah…”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””…… Hah…”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~… Little man…… I should leave you alone for a bit, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, not good, I forgot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess shouted with a look of indignation mixed with tears, demanding not to be ignored.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu, Rebal and Sadiz were already scratching their heads, and the prince, who seemed to have the least understanding of the situation, had a drawn-out smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm, ah, p, princess …… er, I guess the story is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So it is I whom you love, right? Your first love may have been Sadiz, but now it must be me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?! Why … eh? Ah … that? No … why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway…… the princess is… does the princess think I like her?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because we … in the future … we’re going to get married…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s that face like it’s your first time hearing it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because, it’s my first time hearing it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean? We’ve been engaged since we were little, and you were supposed to be my husband and lead the empire with me in the future! Father, and Lord Hiro, intended it as well!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s that!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many shocking events and shocking facts do I need to find out today?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I the princess’ fiancé?! Is that what the Emperor and my father intend?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, is that true!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No…… well…… that…… the Master and Madam wanted it… I knew it, too, in case you were wondering.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Why! Because I’ve been asking Sadiz to be my wife since I was little…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz knew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did Rebal and Fu also know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but why didn’t I, the person in question, know about this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, is that so, Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For once… it wasn’t Princess Phianse’s assumptions or delusions…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, he likes Sadiz so much… that he wants her to be a bride…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, I’m jealous…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh… again, in front of these two…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu… Kron…… um, I’m sorry――――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ever the cur!!!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, who had been silent for a long time, finally got angry, saying “enough”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I’m the only one who can hear his voice…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hey, Earth… y, you… didn’t you know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah… Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That we will be married in the future…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O, ou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I thought you were looking down on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, then, Earth, what did you think of me all this time?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In my eyes… a, a Childhood Friend.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~~~~~~u!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, honestly, I wasn’t good at… talking to the princess… but I feel like it would be kind of bad if I said that out loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even without saying it, it was conveyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’s eyes swirled as she wobbled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It can’t be…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When Earth ran away from the Imperial City… Lady Mamu, said something like……… Earth doesn’t really love me, so I… but that was a lie so I wouldn’t worry, and Earth and I both have feelings for each other… we are lovers, man and wife… yes…… by all rights, once the match was over, we will be together, officially … Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when it happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, the Graduation Match!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess, who was muttering in confusion, looked up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Before the match… how do you explain it? There was that talk we had one morning on our way to school!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You said you knew…… what my feelings and wishes were! You, on the other hand, said you would win the championship to get what you wanted too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember …… saying that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――― I’ve never lost to you… That’s why I won’t lose our match. And when I win the championship… I get everything! Everything… That’s it
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―――Certainly, I’m not sure I’m thinking that deeply about the future compared to you. But… I’m serious about this tournament, too. No, I’m going to take it seriously. I’m the one who wins the championship!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shortly after I met Tre’ainar, I remember having that conversation with the princess when we met by chance on our way to school in the morning…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’ feelings at that time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the sake of the Empire. For the world. For humanity. For the future. We will continue to protect the current world of peace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought maybe she kept harboring such lofty thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The day Rebal and Fu came back! You said you were the one who would win! Because there’s something you can’t give up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember that too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―――I know you guys are strong, but… I’m the one who will win! There’s something I can’t give up either!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I made that declaration after being egged on by Tre’ainar. As a way of putting pressure on myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Didn’t it mean that you would confess and propose to me, as I was thinking of declaring to all the people that I would marry you upon my victory, and give our pledge to serve the people of the Empire, peace, and justice for all eternity?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whaaaaat was thaaaaaaaat!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I never said that… I didn’t mean it that way at all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, really, why would I do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, no way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the princess, so shocked that she collapsed to her knees, her whole body trembled…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, no way, no way! So, what does that mean? Was it… my misunderstanding? Then what did you want to win?! Wasn’t it me?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What you wanted to get when you won… if it’s not me, what was it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I wanted to win and get at that time… something I’ve been chasing for a long time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No! At that time, if I won, Sadiz’s boobs… b… eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hurriedly held my mouth down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I looked at Sadiz involuntarily. Sadiz quickly averted her eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I looked at the princess again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” ( ゜д゜)?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess had an expression I had never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
