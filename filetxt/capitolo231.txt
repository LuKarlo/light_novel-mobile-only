 “For now… the two of thee should talk. Boy. Princess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “P, Prince…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who seemed calm, clapped his hands and announced so, smiling bitterly, as if he pitied the princess a little under the circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It would be awkward and confusing with the goddess and Little man’s friends here, wouldn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, ah… yes, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such is your duty as well, boy. Please face it diligently.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, Shinobu and Sadiz were especially worried that it would get complicated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I’m also confused about various things, so I nodded, thinking that it would be better to calmly unpack the difference in perception between the princess and me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fah? What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it, Earth? Do you have something to say to me? Hmm, Phianse and Earth have something to talk about, do they?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good. Her mind is all over the place…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Let’s go outside for now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha. We’re holding hands.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pulling on the princess’ hand, we step outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe she’s not mentally present, or maybe she’s running away from reality, or maybe she’s gone crazy from an overdose of embarrassment when she realized that she had misunderstood that I always liked her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?’』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Um… hey…… I don’t think so, but… I understand that the princess misunderstood a lot of things about me, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, it was shocking, but if it was just a simple misunderstanding, it might not have gone this far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, when I looked at the situation of the princess now, I had a thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Maybe… the princess… it can’t be… about me…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis something that should be heard from the mouth of the person herself, not something I can answer for you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… yes, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather, just get on with it. We have much do, how long will this nonsense last…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar let out a sigh of exasperation. With a look that said “Don’t keep messing around” in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, Tre’ainar didn’t seem surprised by the situation at all, but did he know it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuih?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Phianse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hah! Ah… ah… eh? …… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We got out of the dungeon and faced each other on the endless sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I called her name, the princess finally seemed to realize the situation while looking around with a huff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… erm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, your manners…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Awkward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”………………””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we were facing each other alone, the atmosphere was extremely awkward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we can’t keep dragging this on…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everything… from the beginning…… has been my misunderstanding… wasn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart ached when the princess weakly asked me that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve always thought that I would marry Earth in the future, and even though Earth’s first love was Sadiz, I thought he intended to marry me in the future, and I thought he liked me during our time at the Academy… but all of it, from the beginning…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And by looking at this face, I knew the answer to the question I asked Tre’ainar earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, that’s what it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve always… liked Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that…… so… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Erm, ever since I was a kid…… up to the way things ended in the Imperial Match and hit my father…… and ran away from the Imperial City…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, I, see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… the thing with you… and Rebal… so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A… about that~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m happy and proud of Rebal’s feelings, but… I didn’t consider the option in the first place. I’m really sorry for Rebal, but I’ve always thought only about marrying you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This thorn on my side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This rigid princess, who always felt like she stood apart from all the heaven, I’ve never seen this woman with such a weak expression, not since we were kids.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu… fu… ha, I don’t know… what to say…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was thinking at the time… that… if I won, I would declare to the whole empire that I would marry you… and if by any chance you should win, you would propose to me… I thought Rebal and Fu would be the challenge, but in any case, once that tournament was over, we would… and then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During my academy days, I grit my teeth to beat her again and again… endure the humiliation… make my own efforts… but I never won… it was like an absolute wall that always stood in front of my path.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You ran away from the Imperial City… in the last few months, you met that Shinobu and… you met that demon called Kron … no…… that woman, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After you were kidnapped by Jamdi’el, I spent time with Shinobu, but she rarely told me about you …… saying that it was just a memory between the two of you, but… anyway, she said she was in love with you. I thought Earth was in love with me, and that Shinobu was just a crazy delusional woman.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s funny. The delusional woman was me… you think so, don’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This genius… child prodigy… monster like this… had a smile on her lips, but she’s totally powerless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So feeble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… do you like either of those two…… or both of them?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I still don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu and Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, damn. I never thought I’d be having this kind of cozy banter with the princess… on top of that…… with that kind of look on her face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m sure I don’t not like them…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… what you mean is…… you are conscious of them, as women?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… well…… wh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, what about me… other than as a childhood friend… have you ever been conscious of me as a woman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t afford to mess around here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not going to lie to you here, Phianse. I never …… thought of you as an object of interest in any way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Misunderstanding upon misunderstanding, completely made things messed up and bothersome for both of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think it’s time to make everything clear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha… why couldn’t I say… just one word… I couldn’t say that I loved you… if so…… why did I take it for granted that we were in love…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t know anything about your feelings… I mean… how ridiculous…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I hurt the princess… Phianse… I mean, I can’t hurt her anymore, and there’s nothing I can do to mend things or fake it now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You weren’t conscious of me because… you only had eyes on Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… yeah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And were you attracted to those two women just because you cooled off to Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… that’s not true.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, Phianse, but when I was in the Imperial City, I was only looking at Sadiz. But the reason I wanted to face the two of them… wasn’t because my feelings for Sadiz had cooled down or anything like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, it’s not even that I don’t like Sadiz anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Then… what attracted you to those two!? Their faces!? Is it because they’re wearing white panties!? Is it because you’re now interested in more than just busty women?! Is it because they let you do e, e, erotic things?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Princess enthusiastically said “I don’t understand” to my words, but… somehow, what does this person think of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. I mean, it’s just that, those two… they didn’t know who I was… maybe that’s why… it was new to me, so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What does… that mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You heard what Paripi said. When I was in the Imperial City… what was bothering me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it seemed that Phianse finally figured it out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She stiffened with a look of surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, those two…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because they saw me… not as the Son of the Hero… but as Earth Lagann… they acknowledged Earth Lagann… and said they liked me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t just those two, but also the kind-hearted Ogre best friend, the meddlesome Yankee, and the people of that secluded nation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my words made the princess furious――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, even I didn’t see you―――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You didn’t even look at me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you still the Son of the Hero? You’re the Son of the Hero, but all you’ve ever done is disappoint your hero parents… that was it, wasn’t it? Ever since I was a kid, ever since I was in the academy! All the time! That’s why I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I found myself yelling in anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you’re one to talk, until I say otherwise its always princess princess princess princess, I had to tell you to call me by name… but you find faults in people other than yourself!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ha… haaa~~~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been that way since we entered the Academy! You don’t refer to me by my name even though we’ve always been good friends… you called me princess, didn’t you? How much do you think that hurt me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, because, you’re the princess! Unlike when I was a little kid, I can’t do that kind of thing anymore…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be ridiculous! You can go on and on about being called the Son of the hero yet you call me a princess, and have the gall to say all that?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, the princess, with an angry face, almost headlong to me, stuck out her face and shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be ridiculous… is this reality? Paripi said as much as he wanted to say… even Coman… and now this? What the hell! What has my life been about so far! Don’t be ridiculous!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the princess also vented her pent-up anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be ridiculous! You’ve done nothing but insinuate to me! In the end, you just want a convenient woman who can pamper you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who the hell are you to say that! I mean, when have I ever made you think I was interested in you! Besides, I don’t think those two are convenient!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was intentionally tough on you! I suppressed my desire to be flirtatious with you and wanted you to mature, and become a better man, a man who is more worthy of me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who asked for that and when? A man worthy of you? Who do you think you are? Don’t flatter yourself!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, and somehow before we knew it, we were shamefully arguing with each other, cursing at each other, so aggressively that it seemed like we would brawl with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It can’t be helped! Even if you weren’t the hero’s child, you were weaker than me! You couldn’t win even once!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, do say that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And from there, you were always frustrated because of your inferiority complex with me, Rebal, and Fu, and you started to whine, twist and demean yourself… something had changed since we were kids and it felt pathetic! I just wanted you to remember the old days when you used to pull us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This… what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! That’s why I thought that the world would not easily acknowledge a man who was weaker than me, who was both a princess and a woman, as my fiancé… that’s why I was so strict with you! If you had been as strong as you were in the Graduation Match from the beginning, I wouldn’t have been so hard on you and I wouldn’t have nagged you so much! I would have let you do whatever you wanted in the costume from the ‘Sexy NyanNyan Collection: Naughty Master Scratch Me’ book you had hidden! I would let you do it! I rubbed tits as much as you wanted without asking Sadiz for a reward!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why did you have that book!? Th, that book was disposed of by Sadiz … I mean, I didn’t want it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I know you didn’t! You didn’t seem to be looking at me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What was it, what the hell was I to you?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, it was the first time we had ever quarreled so badly with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I didn’t notice anything about your feelings… just pushing only my own feelings onto you… I misunderstood… spun around in place… unconsciously hurting you… made you suffer…… I already know that! I get it… but…… but…… let me say a few words…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My whole life… from the moment I met you… I’ve only thought about you… I’m not even allowed …… to say that… a little bit… you hate me… I’m that sinful… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And gradually, we couldn’t even understand what we were saying to each other, but me and Phianse both started breathing on each other’s shoulders…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, ha, ha… come on…… already…… what are we doing… we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true… even though we’re exhausted from the battle with the Six Supremacy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah… I’m tired too… even though I was of no use in the battle…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, we were both sitting on the clouds, heads hung down in disappointment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just, Earth… I was sure you… wanted to be the Son of a Hero… but…… I didn’t fall in love with you because you were the Son of a Hero…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Phian… se…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It would be a meaningless excuse if it didn’t get across… but…… still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
