 “Phian… se…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really… truly… guh… I, I’m so… sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had known Phianse for more than a decade, but for the first time, she apologized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, stop…why… are you like that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m so, sorry… Earth…… uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, me too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why that single “I’m sorry” resonated so heavily with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Me too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My mouth was naturally moving too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was sorry, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what was I sorry for?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What am I trying to apologize for?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For not noticing Phianse’s feelings?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For not living up to her expectations?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For making her cry?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t figure out what I need to apologize for. But when I look at Phianse now, was it all my fault, and she’s just a poor victim?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the answer came naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… maybe I was only thinking about myself…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Phianse was acting with everything in mind for her own convenience, then I was only thinking about myself, and I was covering my ears thinking that all the voices around me were irritating noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… I was also… wrong… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve apologized to Phianse several times before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that apology…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― As you are now, won’t you be a disappointment to your father, the hero, Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I, I lack, the dignity, princess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a frivolous thing, nothing heartfelt about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, in that sense, it might have been my first time too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m the one…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, I… certainly responded to you with condescending sarcasm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s because I was nagging you without knowing how you feel…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, if it was just how you felt about me… I’m sorry I didn’t notice anything about it… that I couldn’t live up to your expectations…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, don’t say that! Me and everyone just forced it on you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I apologize to Phianse because I felt I was at fault.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, my apology made Phianse flustered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, I didn’t just do things that were convenient for me… um…… I also said various things to keep the girls in class from falling in love with you… I really did something awful! I’m sorry!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, that’s …… not a big …… deal, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to my apology, Phianse was like, “No, I’m the one who’s at fault,” and I was like, “No, I am too,” and we apologized again, only this time I couldn’t help but respond.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… no, no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s… certainly…… that’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered. Speaking of which, it was like that every single time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, look… that’s what people around me were always like, ‘Are you still the son of a hero?’. But sometimes you would be there? The girls in class would…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, for example…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――But… the princess is really impressive, but…… Earth is pretty strong, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Yes, he’s a little withdrawn, but looks a bit wild and cool…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――His household is wealthy, too…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The girls in class reacted with a pulse. They were blushing and praising me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was only interested in Sadiz, I was honestly happy and embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t beat the princess, but I was second in my grade, which means I’m an honor student in my class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of that, I have a good family background, so normally girls wouldn’t leave them alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――There seems to be a little misunderstanding. Certainly, he is talented, his face may not be bad, and he comes from a wealthy family. But, he also has a twisted side too. His character is considerably demonic, and tends to be disobedient at times. Also, more than anything, when I was a child, he rudely peeked at my underwear, and he still hides smutty books in his room. The other day, I heard from his maid that he had hidden a double-bottomed drawer and even set up a magic trap to hide them. No, that isn’t good for the boys of his age, but he’s hiding something obscene. His appearance itself isn’t bad, but the eyes are pretty bad, no, I don’t think it’s wild and masculine, it’s just bad. His family is also wealthy, and his parents are two respectable heroes. However, his upbringing is too lenient, and he was spoiled growing up. You don’t want that, do you? No, but it’s not that he’s not working hard. He studies and trains very hard just so he can beat me. While he seems to not care about losing, I have witnessed his figure working hard in shadows without anyone noticing, still, th-that is, yes. He has no delicacy towards girls. Yes, that’s why you should definitely stop aiming for him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She talked so fast and blurted out a lot of bad things about me to the girls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when the girls heard that, they were smiling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Ufufufu, oh we understand, princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Among us… No, I don’t think any girl in the Imperial city is aiming to be Earth’s girlfriend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Right~♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that being said, I didn’t have many sweet and sour memories of the Academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, no matter how you think about it, that’s terrible! No one would accept me… and in the midst of all that twisting and turning, you ragged on me in a rage to all the girls who might have maybe liked me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, uh, uh, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah! I’m getting pissed off all over again just remembering that! If I could have even one good memory at the Academy, maybe something would have changed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s because I’m glad when Earth is praised, but… when Earth becomes popular, or when a girl other than me was wooing Earth… I, I didn’t like it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwha, h, how selfish! Even with such a despondent expression, that is terrible!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, uh, uh, I, I’m really sorry. It, it’s not something that can be forgiven by apologizing, but… really the worst thing you can do as a person… huh? But didn’t you just say that you only had eyes for Sadiz at the time?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s that! This is this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwha?! What is that nonsense way of thinking! In other words, you want to get along with other girls even though you have someone you love, or something like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t go that far, but no, but who knows what would happen…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yoooouuu, you didn’t notice my feelings in the slightest! No, it’s my fault for not telling you, but… But! I’m awful, but is that even an option?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m only human! Even if they’re not my type, when a girl seeks your attention… it feels good! Even though they were making so much noise about Rebal and Fu, I’m the only one left out!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, what is that! It’s a bit pathetic!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, after emotionally cursing at each other a while ago, she apologized for her shenanigans… then again, we argued.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wonder why…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ge, generally speaking, it seems you’re a perv to begin with, even if you’re not! And the genre of books you had was dangerous! [The Magic School Panties Collection], [I Made a Warrior Candidate Say ‘Kuh, Kill Me’], or [Seduced at the Graduation Ceremony, The Magical Mirror Carriage], and so on, that depicted students in uniforms like ours in an obscene manner!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ouna gave those to me as a token of friendship after transferring schools… until then we never interacted?! I’m telling you, I didn’t choose to collect any of them!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you must have read them! Because the books had creases!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I receive it, I’ll look at it! Of course I read them!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why are you saying that so arrogantly?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s what men do! I mean, who are you to talk when you stole erotica from someone’s room without permission! What’s the matter with you?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What~!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The heavy atmosphere of before is gone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Fu~, fu~, fu~……………… puh…””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we bared our teeth, glared at each other and yelled at each other…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pupu, really… already…… hehe… really, Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhaha… jeez, give me a break, Phianse is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? I wonder why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu… aha.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuhahahaha.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’re laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu…why… I… sooner…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why couldn’t I have exposed …… everything more like this… even my unseemly jealousy… I need you to see that ugly part as well… if you don’t accept my true self, it wouldn’t mean anything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse smiled and fell on her back on the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sat down next to her and laughed as I watched Phianse smile like a girl of her age.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… we’ve been together for over a decade… there are things that you can’t understand just by being together… after all, I didn’t know what to put into words, I misunderstood things… whether it’s a childhood friend…… or a parent-child relationship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In that sense, Coman is the same.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nodding at Phianse’s words, a slightly somber air flowed through us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Phianse…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… won’t you go back to the Imperial City? No excuses, no explanation, no matter what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No excuses, no explanation, no matter what, because I have no regrets about my actions and the power I used, the power I acquired.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come to think of it… that’s right. About that… would you tell me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… Hmm~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse’s question turned to ‘that moment’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was when I used the Great Magic Spiral in the Imperial match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, was this a good time to say it? Phianse laughed bitterly at my hesitation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Then, not now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not going to ignore your feelings and ask you to talk about something difficult. Just let me know when you can talk.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse saw my hesitation and pulled away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a bit surprising. In the first place, she must have chased me to find out about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But apart from that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Kron and Shinobu… do they know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No. They don’t.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see, um… then…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She didn’t ask about the truth. Instead, she was checking to see if there were others who knew the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Kron and Shinobu didn’t know. At that moment, it seemed that Phianse clenched his fists slightly, but immediately peeked into my face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, does Sadiz know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah. I told Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, mu… uh, I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded sharply at the question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse pouted a little, but quickly exhaled and laughed again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, I’m weaker than Sadiz right now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it can’t be helped. Rebal and Fu are still no match for Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, and… I… I’ve never lost to you, but now I don’t feel like I can beat you. And now I feel like you’re stronger than Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know about that. I’ve never fought Sadiz in a fight, and I’m sure we have some chemistry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s good… that’s how it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s just how much difference there is between you and me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I don’t have to fight Sadiz like I did with Paripi and Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not what the princess was trying to say…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I am still inexperienced. I still have to improve myself. There are things I need to do before declaring that I will bring you back or marry you, or anything like that. I, too, know only a small world, and I didn’t realize that I was a frog in a well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a strong, determined tone, Phianse told me. Then she stood up and stared at the end of the endless sky…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s time to start from scratch. I won’t lose to you, who wants to go out into the world and live freely…as a princess, as a warrior, as a woman… I… I will aim higher. Right now, from this moment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, so… you can do as you please. I can’t catch you as I am now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without any hesitation, I nodded back at her straight eyes and smiled, which was refreshing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, I don’t need a farewell hug right now. No kissing, no intercourse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, who would do that?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, but… instead…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess held out her right hand to me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Would you mind shaking hands with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Farewell? Reunion? Friendship? Or an oath? It could mean a lot of things, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’ll do my best. You do your best too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least today, we can go back to being childhood friends, and while feeling like we’ve become true friends again, I shook the hand that was offered to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really appreciate your kindness. I didn’t update yesterday because it was Friday the 13th and it was bad luck.
</div>

 With the feedback I’ve received over the past few days, I’m glad that we’ve finally gotten the opinion of the Princess Flame Flash faction. Until now, I had not been able to bring Princess Ferguson to the forefront, but in fact, with the default setting that I can say now, Princess Phan Feihong was really going to be the first heroine.

 As I mentioned at some point before, the story itself was originally planned to end with the first arc. As an initial setting flow that can be said now, in the middle of the Imperial Match, invaders from outer space appeared and the father defended his son and the people, saying, “I will protect my family even if I die” and was taken away as it is. Then, the awakened son and his friends said, “Dad, I’ll save you!” and Dad was like “You’ve become so strong”, and with the spiral powered up by the father’s magic power… no, he defeated the enemy with a Super Magic Spiral and somehow won. What happened to Earth, who realized the princess’s feelings in the middle of the battle? That was the initial setting for this story.

 However, the story received an unexpectedly strong response and was published in book form, so we were forced to change the schedule because we could no longer finish the story.

 So I was frustrated that I had changed my plans and was only able to treat Princess Fingerflare Bombs unfavorably when she was actually a candidate for the first heroine. However, for better or worse, I was finally able to spotlight her, and now I am filled with the feeling that “I am finally ready to start again”.

 And today, the second volume of the book is finally on sale. At the timing of the release of the second volume, I feel “Oh” that the main story has arrived at the current situation in this way.

 If we make it to Volume 3, we will be able to introduce the critically acclaimed “Goddess”, but to be honest, at the moment it is undecided. This is a world of merit competition, so I hope it will continue.
