 “Earth… Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha! Your talk… did you do it right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the two of us returned from the conversation, Rebal and Fu looked surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Phianse had been in a state of confusion for a while now, and most of all, the awkward atmosphere that should have existed between us was gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal, Fu… I’m fine now. We’re done talking.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse replied, and Fu instantly jumped at me with a big smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! Good… I’m glad to hear that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, my neck, urgh so annoying!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m really sorry too… I’m sorry… Earth, I had no idea you were struggling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, okay okay, I get it, You’re going to cry and hug me, even though you’re a man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m glad… you made up with the princess, right? I’m glad… really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought he had become a little stronger during his study abroad, but this baby-faced bastard was still the same as ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, after this happened, I didn’t care anymore, and I naturally sigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile, Rebal calmly asked Phianse what was going on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… the talk is over… so what happens now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, I decided to start over. That’s what I decided.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As we are… we don’t have the power to bring Earth back… also…… we’re not strong enough to stand side by side as equals.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know that as well as I do, don’t you? Rebal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal was at a loss for words when Phianse answered with a refreshing expression without hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not yet… I mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Rebal, I’ve been groping around without knowing what I was looking for, but… now I know, I’m aware of it, that’s what I took from all this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So you… agree?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mm-hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal seemed a little conflicted by Phianse’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He turned to face me and asked with a mysterious expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… are you sure we’re done talking? What Paripi said… we cornered you and―――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal, didn’t I say it? We’re done talking about it. Phianse and I got it done. So it’s enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve had enough of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how it is to me Rebal…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so… but…… I have imposed my own expectations on you… did I apologize?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if it was a path you didn’t want to take, an expectation you didn’t want… even if it was our own selfish expectation… you and I were both born into such a family… more than anything else, that’s what you were… to us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… geez, you’re a hard guy to please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like they’re saying “you’re overly-optimistic”, aren’t they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here, it seems that Phianse was different from Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… that’s all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s all? Is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While saying that he didn’t apologize for what Paripi pointed out, Rebal closed his eyes and bowed his head slightly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I couldn’t help you… that day… I couldn’t back you up, I couldn’t stop you… today…… I couldn’t do anything to help… talk about being your friend… I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha… haha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not like they pushed me into a corner. They’re sorry that they couldn’t help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal’s clumsy feelings came through as he bit his lips in frustration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so like Rebal…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’ll catch up with you someday, I promise.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal’s words, as if he were aiming at me, are a complete change from the time before the Graduation Match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember he was giving off an air of “I’m already too much stronger than you” back then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now he has me as his goal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Unfortunately, I’m not going to let you catch up with me. Because I’m going even further.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How far are you planning to go? Not as a warrior… not as a hero…where are you going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? That’s just the way it is, going as far as it will take me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I said that, Rebal was stunned, but his mouth loosened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph… are you trying to be cool? That’s not an answer, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aanh? I didn’t think a showoff like you would say that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehehehe… but…… it’s not bad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if you don’t know where you’re going… you’re still going farther and farther ahead of us… we’ll chase after you like we’re being pulled along… that’s fine… the path is different, but… you’re okay with that… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Rebal lightly tapped my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the time of the Imperial Match, he was angry at me for trying to choose a completely different path from the Hero, the Imperial Knight, and my father, but now that he sees me, it seemed I have convinced him that this is the right thing for me to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know what you’re aiming for or who you’re going to fight against, but… next time you are in a pinch again… I’ll definitely help you this time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it felt like a declaration to himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal himself must have felt a lot in this battle, being kicked away by the former legendary Six Supremacy and the strength of the rivals of the father he was aiming for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, his eyes looked like he had made up his mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the same with Phianse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I see. Well, I’m going to be strong enough to handle things on my own, but if there’s ever a time like that, I’ll rely on you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lightly patted his shoulder too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, it was the first time I’ve had this sort of manly exchange with this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, it’s like I’m seeing new sides to my childhood friends today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on! I want to be a part of this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuoh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Fu, who was still clinging to my neck, reached out and put his hand on Rebal’s shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, get off me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No! Come on, you guys, stick together like we used to~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’ve never done that before!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then let’s do it now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fine~, annoying irritating unpleasant.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How mean!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, you should say you’ll do your best, like Phianse and Rebal. You were beaten down by Paripi too, so you might want to―――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I tried to shake off Fu, who unlike the other two couldn’t read the air…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Obviously.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, as the child of the Seven Heroes, he has lived with pride in that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s just a smiling optimistic guy who’s glad everyone was able to reconcile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I definitely don’t want to be left out… today…… we got a glimpse of the world where Earth is now in… and the world our parents once fought… I’ll never lose sight of that again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, this guy… these guys were saying this, and I guess they’ll do their best now that they’ve found a new goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I need to train with my master again so I don’t let them catch up to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I need to be able to win with my own strength, not just by luck or Tre’ainar’s strategy like I did today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For the time being… thou mood was awkward till recent, how fare thee now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Huh?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who had been watching us in silence the whole time, came out with his arms crossed and a smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s nice, thou all. pleasant.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, what the heck, Prince…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I have subordinates who fight alongside me… and cute little birds who adore me… but unlike thee… I had no friends or comrades…with whom to bicker with, to inspire each other, to laugh with, and accept each other for who we are…… so I too… wanted them…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince smiles dazzlingly, somewhat envious of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it? It doesn’t seem like such a big deal, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, the one I want to acknowledge me most is … my own kin, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh I see… that’s right, he always lived with a lot of troublesome circumstances…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, I’m much the same… I too shall start over. This Heavenly World itself… once again. I’m truly sorry for the people of that country where Jamdi’el was.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, well, you can talk to Mr. Machio and the others over there. I’m sure you’ll be able to find a way to apologize and what you’ll do from now on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed, I’ll do just that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just Phianse, Rebal and Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like Kron earlier, the Prince seemed to have come to realize what he needed to do from now on and thinks that he had to work harder, and somehow everyone seemed to be refreshingly cohesive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come along, I’ve taken care of thy comrades, I’ve sealed Jamdi’el’s eyes, for now… does all fare thee well?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while me and Phianse were talking, the rest of the post-processing procedures seemed to be done.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there’s nothing more to do in this country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, even though I arrived at a world that was said to be legend and stepped foot on it, I couldn’t even take my time looking around, but this country is not in that situation now, and before it becomes troublesome …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, then, let’s go…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let’s go back. To the Surface. And next for me and Tre’ainar is――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something I’ve been thinking about lately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I received various opinions, the Kron faction, the Shinobu faction, the Sadiz faction, the Flora faction… oh, I’m sorry. Flora is no good. Flora is everyone’s waifu. By the way, I’m a person who really cherishes childhood friends, so don’t get me wrong. I like childhood friends. Sometimes when you have to make a choice, you have to make a difficult decision. That aside, it’s rare to see a princess with so many names. How much will it increase? By the way, the name I received from a reader that caught my eye was Princess Fraser, who immediately gave me a counter. For a moment, I imagined that Kim Ping was wearing a dress. Rumor has it that he’s the inspiration for H〇ro 〇de〇’s Tod〇ki.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, for the time being, I was relieved to hear everyone’s thoughts on these four.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Tre’ainar faction is gone… I see. No, it’s fine, but I stupidly thought that the master, who hasn’t been involved in the last few episodes, seems to be feeling a little lonely lately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
