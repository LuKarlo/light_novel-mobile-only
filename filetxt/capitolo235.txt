 “”””Whaaaat, the Goddess and the High Priestess are leaving the country.””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and Jamdi’el will not return to the Cacretale. No, the moment I told everyone about the fact that they couldn’t return, there was a cry of astonishment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally. Most of the people here are like disciples of Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, how could that be?! We promised everyone that we would all go home together, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really! The battle is over… besides, without the two of you, what would we do from now on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was especially true for Karui and Elder Sis Tsukshi, who have spent time together like family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re already in tears and clinging to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you, everyone. For thinking so much of us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But this is something we have already decided. We can no longer return to Cacretale.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I don’t understand why! By any chance, are you worried about what happened this time!? I doubt any of us hold a grudge against you two!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsukshi…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or are you worried about something similar happening again? We’ll be alright~! No matter how many times we are…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That won’t do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elder Sis Tsukshi who desperately clung, not wanting to part.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the midst of all this, Mr. Machio remained calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If Earth Lagann hadn’t been here today, we would have lost… we would have all been killed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Earth, you will not marry the goddess and live forever in Cacretale… will you? Then, if something similar happens again… above all, the master’s power is also sealed… and that’s the way we find ourselves now… I guess that’s what it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without me, we wouldn’t have won today… I mean… let’s not mention how things might not have been like this if I hadn’t fought and exhausted Jamdi’el in the first place…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understood after this fight, we’re weak. We’re powerless. Tsukshi, Karui, everyone. If you take a vow to protect someone… if you don’t have enough strength, it wouldn’t make any sense.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today has become a new day of determination for Kron, Phianse, Rebal, Fu, the Prince, and even Mr. Machio.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The devastating defeat in the battle against Paripi instilled a further change in the mindset of Mr. Machio, who normally boasts of superhuman-level strength, and yet worked so hard on a regular basis that no one could keep up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing Mr. Machio’s words, everyone who had only complained that Kron and the others would not return to the Cacretale also looked at each other with a complicated look on their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We were…weak…certainly…I guess so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me too… I was just running away in the end…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you put it that way… we’re all the same.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My crotch too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was taken out in an instant…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sh*t… when I get back, I’ll triple my strength training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m throwing 10,000 straight fist thrusts.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were weak. It seemed that everyone understood that as it sunk in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Mr. Machio, on behalf of everyone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master. Even in your absence, we will not neglect our training. So that next time the two of you can be protected without any worries… we will become stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… at that time, once again… we want you to live with us. I will definitely restore Cacretale as well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Machio’s words made me and Phianse feel like we couldn’t say anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “High Priestess, please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We will become stronger!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next time, I promise!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From now on, Cacretale will face interference from outside parties, like the Union.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because my father was already involved, and it was revealed that Jamdi’el was living in that country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, according to Paripi, outside support is indispensable for restoring the current Cacretale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that is the case, will the day come when Jamdi’el, the world’s highest bounty, will be able to live proudly in Cacretale again………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu, well… everyone… remain diligent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure Jamdi’el knows that, but she doesn’t say anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There may have been various schemes behind the scenes, or it may have been a place or relationship that she was just trying to take advantage of, but Jamdi’el also has a heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were disciples who she spent more than 10 years with, and moreover, raised with great care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seemed to have some feelings for them, and only offered words of encouragement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Osu!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The last sound was spirited voices and bows that sent vibrations through the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does that mean Earth will be gone too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously, I haven’t had a crotch match with you yet!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wanted that ass!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I hear that you can also wield a sword. I would like to have a match with my Seven Star Sword…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Where are you going, aye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh~, are you for real, Big Brother!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’m also saying goodbye here, so Elder Sis Tsukshi, Karui and the other stubborn people I’ve spent the last few months with all cling to me in unison.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~, well, I’ll come to hang out once in a while… once things calm down.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absolutely!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Absolutely!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, unlike Jamdi’el, I’ll at least be able to come back and visit again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But only if the eyes of father and the Union become less strict…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, thank you for your help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Machio.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m glad you were here. I’ll continue to train myself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’m grateful, too. Because the battle with Mr. Machio pushed me to the next stage.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I high-fived Mr. Machio, Pachin, and exchanged goodbyes with everyone I met in the Cacretale…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then, it’s time to send thee on thy way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince clapped his hands to signal our departure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Come to think of it, we’re all going to get on the fishing boat… ah… but Hilua’s going to take Kron and Jamdi’el on board, and I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, about that, the ship thou came on seems to have been damaged quite a bit, so later we’ll repair it here and give it back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah, is that so? But then how do we… will you guys carry us down?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay, if it’s a dozen or so… come on, little birds! Come on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if we say we will go back, we will not be able to go back in the same way as we came, so I thought that the seraphs would carry us one by one, but it was a little different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooooh, a pegasus… eh, I’ve only seen one in picture books… it really exists…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! Seriously!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, that’s amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the prince clapped his hands, dozens of war maidens astride white winged horses…… in other words, pegasi, appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing the beautiful furry Pegasus, the princess group got excited with a twinkle in their eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “One by one, get behind them! I’ll send thee home with the heavenly steeds, the pride of the Heavens, controlled by my cute little birds.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Oooooooooh!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, of course, the men were thrilled to ride on such a Pegasus…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, seriously! Behind that cute angel?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku~, I’ll just get in the middle of the action…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Seven stars are buzzing… is now the time to meet the woman of destiny under the guidance of the stars?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, maybe it’s simply because they can sit closely behind the cute seraphs… these guys…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince… art thou sure of this? Even though His Majesty hasn’t regained consciousness yet, such a thing… and even about Jamdi’el…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed, I shall assume all responsibility. I’ll manage it all, whatever my father says. So, please lend me thy strength.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… ah, I… if it’s for the sake of the prince… I’ll go to any lengths, do anything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At some point, the seraphs turned pale and their expressions were disgusted by the atmosphere of these bastards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, unlike the prince, these guys didn’t watch the battle in the palace, so even if they were told that we were actually the benefactors who saved the Heavenly World, they wouldn’t be easily convinced, so they may not want to be in close contact with such nasty men, even if it’s on the prince’s order.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, gentlemen, heed my words. Even if I am indebted to thee, should thou do something obscene to my cute little birds, they may just drop thee into the sea. Do keep that in mind”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…… Yes…””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, at any rate, the prince probably gave them a non-threatening warning, so the bastards should be fine, but they still can’t hide the look of joy on their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it was the same with the princess group who genuinely saw the Pegasi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooooh, m, me too… I want a Pegasus… hoh… hmm, I wonder if I could bring one back to the Imperial City…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, this would make shopping a lot easier, and it would be easy to get across mountains and seas when Little man is in a pinch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, in the midst of all that, there was also someone unexpected…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~, Pegasus… I never paid much attention to them during the battle, but… Hmm…… I thought their legs would be weak as they mainly moved with their wings, but… they are stable while carrying extra passengers as well… Hohoho…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Tre’ainar beside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He watched the flock of Pegasi roaming in front of him with great interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What, Tre’ainar. You are interested in the Pegasus too?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I have not seen many before. But in terms of interest, tis more about horses in general than the Pegasus itself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh? Horse? What the hell are you… did you ride a horse too? Eh? You? What’s the point…… of riding a horse?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again, I sleekly learned about the unexpected side of Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, he could fly to any place, or done something like warp to anywhere in an instant, so he wouldn’t need to ride a horse or anything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I rode not for transportation. I was merely riding as a hobby.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hobby?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh. I used to hide my identity and participate in horse races on the Surface and in the Demon Realm, with my beloved horses.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… What!? Ah, you… horse racing!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Heh, do not be so surprised, I was once known as the world’s best leading jockey despite being unidentified, and won many major prize races, including the Demon Realm Derby.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar crossed his arms and recounted tales of his valor with a triumphant look… no…… I’m speechless…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I miss… my favorite horse Kangkoo Bryan, who won me the Triple Crown in the Demon Derby… and Fuka Impact… they were all fine steeds…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I, is that so…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Speaking of which, I won some of the most prestigious prize in the Surface World, such as the ‘Starting Gate Award’, ―――― 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And just when Tre’ainar’s eyes began to sparkle as he gradually became more and more passionate about the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, boy. Art thou heading to a different place than everyone else? Like the goddess and Jamdi’el.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Oh, yeah…but only halfway.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, everyone was already getting ready for a double ride on the Pegasus, and I seemed to be the only one left, the prince smiled brightly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get on, boy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll send thee to wherever thou will go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll keep it a secret for the rest of my life that I got an unintentional shock when he said something that made me nervous because he was so beautiful even though he was a man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s going to be extra complicated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, behind you…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do thou hate it? Then would thou sit in front of me? Between my arms… Right? I’ll hold on tight so thou don’t fall off.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, am I a kid?! Don’t say creepy things!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, so shy … even though he is so strong… pretty cute, isn’t he? I can see why all those charming flowers are drawn to thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See here, don’t be shy, put your arms around my waist, hold on tight ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Glancing at people, smiling and teasing… or rather, this guy really is too good-looking… is he really a man?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, come to think of it, nobody knew about me in that race, so the payout ratio was stupendous… Hehehehe, the expressions on the faces of those who were stunned when the favorites were defeated and their tickets were torn into pieces. They were so pitiful.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Tre’ainar? I’m sorry, I lost my attention halfway through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
