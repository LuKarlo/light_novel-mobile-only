 “Earth, I’m sure you’ll meet us again at the top!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stay healthy, Little man! Please come back anytime.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, take care of yourself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master, please be well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess, High Priestess, and Big Brother will definitely come again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sure they will!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uooooooohh!!!!!!!Masteeeeeeeeeeer, Goddeeeeeeeeeeees, Eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarth!!!Um, Hiluaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seraphs and everyone riding with them on Pegasi flew from the clouds as they were waving at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were some tears. But there were smiles and a refreshing feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A lot happened today, it was a tough time mentally and physically, but I smiled and waved back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… I’ll talk to the Master and Madam myself… I’m not going to chase you anymore… but…… but I ask you to trust me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, I will also talk to them. But I’m not saying that this is the last farewell.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, I ran away from the Imperial City and had many encounters, but this may be the first time that I was able to part with a smile on my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, Phianse, everyone else…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey, we’ll definitely meet again♡…Ufufufu… Kron, my rival, doesn’t intend to travel or live with Honey… Phianse-hime is already going home… Sadiz-san wishes the best for her Botchama… Ufu, ufufufufufufufufu… to think that the rivals around Honey would disappear by themselves without any effort on my part… this is it! All that’s left, find the proper timing and from the shadows again… ufufufufufu, with this, it’ll be my win!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, even though Shinobu was waving her hand, she had a terrifying grin on her face… well…… that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone, take care?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s all play again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and Hilua smiled and waved at everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmph…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Jamdi’el crossed her arms and remained silent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both eyes were normal eyes, her Heraldic Eyes will no longer open… I expect……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone… they are already so far away…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron muttered sadly as she watched everyone on Pegasi who had already moved far away to the point where they looked like peas.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But she quickly clenched her fists and looked up with eager eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s go, Jamdi’el, Hilly. Earth is with us halfway, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, Lady Kron… is that…… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Leave it to me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el was also a little puzzled by Kron, who quickly switched and looked forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, Kron changed and became really strong, to the extent that even Jamdi’el, who had been with her for over a decade, had become like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was worried about a lot of things, but it seemed that they will be okay from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, from now on, ‘that guy’ will be…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, let’s get going too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I stopped waving my hand at Sadiz and the others who were already far away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el and Kron ride on Hilua’s back, and I get behind the prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, this was still a bad idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then, Hiyo~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come now, hold fast, princess ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m a man! Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince, who teased me for being embarrassed, sent a signal to the Pegasus.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the Pegasus raised its front legs to gain momentum and jumped straight off the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoh, nuh, fall, abu, nuh-uh, guh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…… nh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first I felt embarrassed to put my hands around the prince’s waist, but the moment we jumped off, I reflexively clung to his body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha, thou art too startled, boy. Art thou so scared to hold on so desperately?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? No… no, I’m fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahahaha, is that so? Then, firmly put thy arms around my ‘waist’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lost my balance a little and, to my embarrassment, clung to the prince’s body in a daze, and the prince made fun of me for that, but… right now, I felt something strange in my palm… it was soft… no, it’s firm, but… just a little softer? What part of the prince’s body did I just touch?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, are we too close? The scent… even though he’s a man, why does this guy smell so good?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah, child? You… have you not realized it at all?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, this one may be dressed as such, but actually――――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar gave me a scowling look and said…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, where are we headed?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? … oh, um…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was about to say something, but was upset by the prince’s question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, Kron’s party will head to the westernmost coastline of the Empire, where they will be picked up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was decided after talking with Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. So, where should I send thee, boy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I want you to go a little further after we’ve dropped Kron.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I don’t mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I mean, if you think about it carefully, we’ll just stop for a while and then we’ll be back in the territory of the Empire we’ve left…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the particulars Tre’ainar and I decided on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, my Pegasus is a capable escort at great distances in little time. However, is that funny dragon over there doing fine?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, what, did you just make fun of me?! Watch me! I, I’m quite confident in my flying speed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, fast fast fast!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Kron, don’t lean out too much… then again, what is this dragon? Where in heavens did thou find it… Earth Lagann?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Ah. Me and Kron summoned him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while we were talking, the continent closest to Cacretale came into our sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, look, boy. Over there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Oh…… a continent came into view… but that’s not it…… that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… The Kingdom of Bethreal…… or…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, that’s another country, I’ve never seen one!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A large port town can be seen along the coastline facing the sea, and several ships were anchored.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A country I’ve never been to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron had a twinkle in her eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh… is that… The Kingdom of Bethreal…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also looking at it, with a “Hoh~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar, have you ever been to that country?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, never that country, I was not particularly interested. Although a member state of the Union, its national strength is below the middle level… tis a country far inferior to the Empire and the Kingdom of Japone…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I see. Well, I don’t know much about it either.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Primarily, I want to freely travel, so I guess stepping into a country I’ve never been to is one of the pleasures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it weren’t for transporting Kron’s party, I might have thought it would be okay to take a little detour.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The Kingdom of Bethreal… speaking of which…… “that little girl” who was one of the Seven Heroes was from that country… come to think of it, what is she doing? Did she not notice that Jamdi’el had been lurking just a stone’s throw away for more than a dozen years?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Kingdom of Bethreal… speaking of which…… “that little girl” who was one of the Seven Heroes was from that country… well, she never did return to that country after the war, so I was able to hide in Cacretale, not far away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar and Jamdi’el muttered almost simultaneously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And they both spoke of the member of the Seven Heroes from that country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar responded to Jamdi’el’s mutterings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On that subject, of the Seven Heroes except father and mother, only one of them mattered to Treina…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh? Oh~…… didn’t you know? Oh yeah, we didn’t talk about that.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. What do you mean? I thought all the Seven Heroes had high positions in their homes, but… well, most of them are from the Empire.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh. Five of them. Father, mother, the Emperor, Rebal’s father, Fu’s father.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And Kojirou of Japone is the head of the Samurai Warriors, is he not? I did hear that much. But then again, I am yet to hear about the last, ‘That Little Girl’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I remember correctly, you talked about that during the Cacretale tournament, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I recall, it was in the course of talking about the Six Supremacy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The youngest of the Seven Heroes… at the time, she was still a little girl, about seven or eight years of age? “Espie”… I suppose she will be over twenty now, but she was quite the interesting one… no, that is why she was so interesting… she must have been used by the adults of Bethreal, but… could it be due to the circumstances there?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar fondly mentions the name of one of the Seven Heroes, who was also a former enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know that ‘name only’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’ve only heard about her in stories, and I’ve never met her.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~, she was a companion to your parents, and she seemed like a little sister to them, but… did you never come across each other in all that time?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I haven’t. My father and mother may have met occasionally after the war, but at least I haven’t met Kojirou or Espie.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’ve never met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don’t know about before I could remember.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even that Old man Mikado said he had met me when I was a baby.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis fine. That aside… what is Espie doing now?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Now?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, I don’t know. But from what I’ve heard… there were various incidents with her country, so they cut off their relationship… it seems that she didn’t have any family… and for a while she was doing something with the Allied Force, but what are they doing now? I don’t know, my father and mother wouldn’t tell me about it in detail, and I wasn’t really that interested either…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve heard a lot about the saga of the Seven Heroes, and even read about it in textbooks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That included the post-war political relationship with the demons and the Demon Realm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t know much about Espie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth Lagann, thou… what does thou know about Espie?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to tell Tre’ainar that I didn’t know, but it was Jamdi’el who asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? No, only the name… unlike the other Seven Heroes, what is she doing now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I replied, Jamdi’el stared at the port town of Bethreal and then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Before… I asked Hakuki… he told me that Espie and Norja were working on――― “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before she could say it, her words were interrupted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I found theeeeeeem!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There they aaaaaaaaaaare!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――――――――――――eh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, Horsey! But go faster now”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll heal you up if you get tired! I’ll give you lots of great carrots later! So, please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I turn around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There, from far behind, someone was chasing after us at breakneck speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wha, what!? So fast! Something is coming…! I mean, uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I strained my eyes, I saw it was a Pegasus flying at a furious pace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And straddling it with a loud voice…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, wai… why!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… what!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and Jamdi’el were stunned at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Who is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch,… Hiro… Mamu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father!? Mother!? Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Sadiz and Phianse said they’d talk to them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I guess they never even listened to what they had to say, borrowed the Pegasus from the Seraph for the time being, and chased after you with all their might…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… most likely…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see… those two… they don’t listen to people… even if Sadiz and Phianse say to “trust me”… they won’t even believe them… no, they chased after me before even hearing about it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way…… this is bad
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was in such a hurry, I hadn’t noticed it yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither Jamdi’el nor Kron noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and mother chasing after us on a single Pegasus carrying two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, they weren’t actually “two people”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, there was one other… a very small one… between father and mother… clinging tightly to my father’s back, and my mother hugging her from behind…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
