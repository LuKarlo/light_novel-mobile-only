 Watching my parents chasing after us at breakneck speed, Tre’ainar let out a sigh of exasperation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That fool. In all likelihood――――』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Whoa, what? A Pegasus from the sky… what’s going on? Uh, is that Sadiz? Phianse too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Master… Madam…… I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I’m glad you’re safe… but what the hell is this? And Sadiz… where’s Earth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Little man will not return home
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Master, Little ma――!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――He’s not coming back!? Why not! That’s… I’ll have to ask him directly!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― No, that’s why…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Huh? There’s a shadow coming from that cloud… is something flying in the other direction? Is that… Earth maybe!? This can’t keep happening! Sadiz, and the Winged Lady, I’m borrowing your horse!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Master!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Hiro, I’ll ride along too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Hiya, waiiiiiiiiiiiiit, Eaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarth!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Masteeerr, Madaaaam, let me finish talkiiiiiiiiing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『—————— and well, it would go as such, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Jeez, I could clearly imagine the scene too.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the image that Tre’ainar had envisioned flowed into my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I could easily imagine that scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s probably how it went.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though Sadiz and Phianse said they would “talk to my father”, the fact that it took so little time to catch up must mean that they did not listen to them at all and just came running.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, hey, Earth Lagann! Of all people…Hiro…Mamu…what shall we do?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, those people over there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… I can’t just hand over Jamdi’el and Kron like this… Prince! Hilua! Let’s flyyyyyyy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I fail to follow, but thou should avoid capture, is it? Understood. Nevertheless…… that man possesses tremendous power… a Pegasus, which can only be controlled by a Seraph… has instinctively surrendered and is following his commands…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? I’m pretty serious already! Should I fly faster?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, they will catch up with us if things continue like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eaaaaaaaaart! Jamdi’eeeeeeel! Stoooooooop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, stop! And talk to us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I could patch things up with Sadiz, Phianse, and the others… I still can’t deal with those two… and with Jamdi’el and Kron… that’s why I can’t afford to get caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed, that they declare, but we won’t stop. Is that okay? Boy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah! Can you get away?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Leave it to me. It’s still too early for humans to challenge the speed of us Seraphs in the sky.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite feeling the intense pressure of the fierce pursuit, the prince was confused at first, but now he seemed calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He released one hand from the reins he had been holding with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Strange Dragon, will thou surrender thyself to me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If wings alone are not enough, let the wind become our ally!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, magic power gathered in the prince’s hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At times, the wind can endanger lives. But sometimes the wind pushes us forward. Such exquisite power is possible only because I have the Heraldic Eye… 【Mega Wind Boost】!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nnuh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic that was released was wind. It enveloped the whole body of our Pegasus and Hilua, becoming a propulsive force that pushed us forward at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nnah, so much! Somehow, it’s comfortable yet going at such great speed! I’m pushed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow! Now, it’s faster than ever!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Wind Boost】… a spell used by the Seraph to accelerate flight… however, if the force is not adjusted properly, the powerful winds will destroy the body… not only to ourselves, but also to the Pegasus, that dragon and others riding along… well, it is easier with the Heraldic Eye, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A magic spell to promote acceleration, huh…… now then……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s fast. It’s as if we ourselves have become one with the wind… I must not be shaken off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nnh, wait, they’re getting faster! They’re trying to get away!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t you go any faster?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, damn it! Horsey, you can’t lose hope?! I’ll give all the high-grade carrots and apples from the Empire you want later!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The distance that should have been closing widened again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and mother are amazed at the prince’s magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We shall soon break off from them. Boy. Goddess. Jamdi’el. Strange dragon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they can’t keep up with this speed――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooooooooooh!!! That’s the spiriiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eehh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, the voices of my father and mother that were heard from a distance… somehow, they seem to be getting closer and closer again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, this is why that man is such an irregularity…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm… as I remember. Same as ever…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Pegasus and Hilua accelerate with wind magic. The prince had just said with a smug face, “Only I can do it because I have a Heraldic Eye”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el must have nodded in admiration as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what were you saying, Prince? The Pegasus that my father is riding… is also accelerating with wind magic and chasing after us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ridiculous… how in heavens…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They’re getting faster, too. What the hell is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the Pegasus that my father and mother were riding on accelerated with the wind just like ours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the prince was surprised at this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And right here, these two people know what that means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My goodness, Hiro, that idiot… even without the Heraldic Eye, he made an attempt by imitating what he sees… that’s what it means.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One is Jamdi’el.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, she knows more about my father than I do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know this because she’s fought against the “serious father” that I don’t even know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ridiculous… imitating my spell? And perfectly controlling the force…? Nay…… I don’t believe it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, how about this? Second leg!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Boy, hold the reins for me for a moment!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince still had an even higher “technique”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I grabbed the reins he was holding from behind and he released his hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, condensed the magic power in the center of both palms?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If a simple Wind Boost will not do… accumulate the wind… in other words, compress the wind to the limit and then release it. By doing so, for a moment, it creates further explosive acceleration!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… to unleash the magic after compressing it… hmm… this also requires the ability to apply magical techniques, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here we go, boy! Dragon! Instant Acceleration, 【Mega Turbojet】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a true explosion. An intense acceleration that was incomparable to what we had just experienced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, he put up a kind of barrier around us so that the wind doesn’t cut the Pegasus’ or our skin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoo, oooooooooh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kyaaah, that’s amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So cool!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me, Kron, and Hilua all burst out laughing at that intense acceleration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this is the case…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, something again… did the guy on horseback with Earth do it? That’s magic I ain’t seen before…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you’re losing them again, idiot Hiro! Look, just do what they’re doing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jeez, uh, like this, this maybe… is that it? Come on! Oh, got it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I thought about it, my father used the same magic as the prince by imitating what he saw, and was catching up with us again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wh… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder the prince thought that. I am the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, here, another person who knows my father other than Jamdi’el…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『With the Heraldic Eye, one can analyze the magic seen with the eye in detail with theory and logic, decipher it in the brain, and then make the magic their own. In that sense, Hiro may be unable to explain the current magic of the prince with logic and theory. But he can still use his magic by the mere sight of it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Tre’ainar, who knew more about my father than even Jamdi’el, for that matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not an ability. He is able to embody the images he sees with his eyes and what he feels with his body, without any logic or theory.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, not ability… simply talent.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The cruelest force in the world, in a sense, that can unravel the power that a person acquires through bloody efforts and repetitive practice done over and over again without rest, and can do it with just one word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, this magic… by casting it continuously, we can go faster, can’t we? Like this… yes, here we go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Wh… my spell in succession!? Ridiculous… to accumulate and release magic at ultra-high speed, and then accumulate and release it again repeatedly… even though the repetition of this process requires tremendously advanced technique and vast amounts of magic power… who in heavens is that man?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Haha, at the end of the day, far from imitating the prince’s magic, did he develop it into something even more amazing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that’s him, my father…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter what! If you have the spirit, you can do anything! Come on, no matter where you go, even if it’s the end of the world, I ain’t letting you go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the thing… Father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, my father wouldn’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth! Stop already! I can’t trust Jamdi’el either, but as your dad, I’m going to have a proper talk with you… no, more than that, your dad and mom, we both have to apologize to you―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I… approached my father, who shouted at me from behind…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh! Oh! What is it, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father … have your talents ever brought you despair?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a happy reaction for a moment when I called my father, but then I heard a scoff, as if my words were unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t look back. I won’t get caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to keep looking forward, and I’m not going to be so pathetic…… as to complain to my father…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
