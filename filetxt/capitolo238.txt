<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said that to him. But I couldn’t help myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, right now, I felt terribly uncomfortable with my father’s no-nonsense behavior as he desperately chased after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides…… I just remembered…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Well, you’re the type to grow slowly. Take your time and do your best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those are the words that he said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be frank, nothing irritated me more than those unreliable words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, you… what are you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father and mother looked stunned by my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 without looking back at those two, I continued to pester them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course, you’ve been working hard, too, haven’t you? You’ve had a hard time, haven’t you? You’ve been through a lot of pain during the war, haven’t you? There were some sad moments, but I’m sure you’ve overcome them too, haven’t you? I don’t know much about the past, but I think it must have been like that for you. I know that my father’s life wasn’t just easy victories. I also fought against the Six Supremacy, and I felt their overwhelming power, so my parents who fought against them must have been struggling… but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, after all, my father can’t understand what I’m going through.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Does my father know how I feel? How for more than a decade I’ve been striving for a Magic Sword that didn’t suit me… my days of being neglected, being told that I was your son, or that I was still growing up every day… my feelings…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Huh!?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And my father and mother, who were stunned by my words, raised their voices in a panicked manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?! Earth… what…… doesn’t suit you… that’s… such a thing…… uh…… Earth…… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It didn’t! I didn’t have it! Even if I might have had qualities that were above normal… not enough for a Hero thoroughbred!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was also what I had blurted out when I fought Rebal in that Imperial match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess they both remember that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Choking on my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I don’t have the same talent as my father. Even if I imitate my father, I would spend my whole life and never catch up with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because they had heard my words at that time, neither of them could deny it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not the point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My father, who can see, feel and act on instinct and can do almost anything, doesn’t know why I can’t do that. That’s why you didn’t even understand what was happening with me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar speaks of things in theory and reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― For you a 【Magic Swordsman】… rather, Hiro’s fighting style is unsuitable. He is the type to focus a suicide attack on a single point without thinking ahead. He utilizes the firepower of his magic in the sword to the utmost in order to defeat his opponent. This is realized when the person possesses great muscle mass, a tremendous amount of magical power, endurance, and fortitude to resist a half-hearted counterattack. None of this applies to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― You are Hiro’s son, but your inherent strength and magical power differ from your father’s. No matter how much you imitate Hiro, you can never surpass him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as we met, he saw that I was not suitable for the Magic Sword, and he also explained to me properly, “Why was it not suitable”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore, in Cacretale, he explained to me the style I should aim for…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― If a broad and shallow term like Jack of all Trades still concerns you, consider this. What you are aiming for is… to learn everything extensively and intimately… to have Dexterous Affluence!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――…… ha… hahaha…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― And… I … call those who show prominence in a single talent ‘specialists’, and those who excel in everything, ‘generalists’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He explained everything step by step and convinced me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father, and mother, what did see of me for over a decade? You didn’t know why I couldn’t do it, did you? No, you didn’t see that much of me in the first place, did you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Huh!?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why couldn’t I beat Phianse or Rebal? Am I the type of person who grows slowly? But will I be able to do it someday? Because I’m the child of you two? Because I’m the Son of the Hero? With enough effort? Don’t make fun of people!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I could tell without looking back that they were both in shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because they were both speechless, and my father’s magic hand of acceleration had stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it doesn’t matter now. I don’t need to talk about it anymore. Because now… I’ve already… been rewarded…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, things had already paid off in the heavenly world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For ten years, I’ve been working hard on something that didn’t suit me. But those days weren’t in vain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It became the decisive factor in my victory over that Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My decade was connected to that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I was rewarded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar showed me that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… now there’s someone by my side… looking at me… looking at Earth Lagann.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, right beside me right now was Tre’ainar, who understands me, who watches over me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then there’s Kron, who saw the fruits of my efforts and recognized me as me. So is Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t want to talk about this to my father, who would never understand me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah… I should have grown up a bit too… I didn’t mean to say this… but it seems like I still rebel against my father and mother like a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for now, I think it’s fine. So……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Prince, accelerate …… while you still can.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wah, y, yes… very well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I patted the prince on the shoulder and told him to keep his distance from the two, who were probably in shock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……is that…… right…… Earth. We…… we’re failures as parents… I didn’t see anything…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know… we didn’t know anything… I didn’t even know what I didn’t know!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard their voices again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”That’s why I won’t lose sight of you this time, I don’t want to make a mistake this time!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then they lose sight of me while still stunned with shock… isn’t happened…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, all the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t feel like getting caught by the two of you right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what you say, I can’t look back…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goddess! High Priestess! …… Older Brother!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that, too unexpected voice… I shouldn’t have looked back at my parent’s cries… I turned around to that small, but loud cry…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Ara? Th, that voice!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha, what? Why is she…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as Kron, who should have been poised in this situation, was astonished, and Jamdi’el was equally surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way… that girl…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait! Why? Where are you going? Why are you leaving!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That little girl… she poked her head out from between my father and mother, and her eyes were moist… ah…… sh*t…… darn it…… I…… why is she…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… that sh*t father of mine… of all people…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put my own stupidity on the shelf and unintentionally took it out on my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I never thought she’d be here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, ah… Earth! It’s Amae! Amae is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why is Amae with Hiro…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn… the situation is just like…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Boy, who’s that pretty lass?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? It’s little Amae!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that my parents had landed in Cacretale, so they met Amae and the others there, and when they chased after me, she jumped on board like, “Amae too!”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That stupid father must have said something like, “Right, come on!”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I was going somewhere with Kron and Jamdi’el without saying anything to her… I betrayed Amae, who was waiting for us to return… it’s my responsibility…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, what are you going to do? Amae… Amae is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron was also agape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Kron also fond of Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae was also fond of Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait~!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Desperately, she reached out to us… it’s natural to pull us back… I’d do the same, damnit!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, but… now……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Someday… definitely again… so, for now… now…… go ahead, Prince.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I can’t let those tears stop me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! But that’s… like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… we have no choice. Lady Kron, right now we can’t afford to be caught by Hiro and his group…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Art thou sure? Boy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Hey, are we going away?! Amae is crying! Hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So… I’m sorry…… Amae…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… ah… Older… Brother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… someday surely -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… l… ar… iar… liar!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―――――eh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Liar, liar… liar…… you liaaaaaaaar!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pulled by that voice, I look back again and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You said you’d come back! I said we’d play a lot! You said! You said! Said! But… but… you liaaaaaaar!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, damn it… come to think of it…… when I was younger… my father and mother were like that――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can also listen on
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
