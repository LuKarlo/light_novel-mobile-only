 Chasing, chasing, and finally finding Earth, he stubbornly refuses us, and more, escapes with Yamidile, the goddess of Kakretaire, and perhaps a handsome who is probably of the same race as Yamidile. I heard about Yamidile over a dozen years in Kakuretaire. Good thing too. And that kind of youth called Yosei. Maam and I know Yamidile at the time of the war. Has it changed, or are you plotting something? Is Earth being deceived? Isn't it? Is there anything to do with Earth's ability to use the Great Demon Trainer's skill? I do not understand. That's why I followed him. I want to know the truth. I want to know his feelings. And above all, I apologize for not being a proper parent. There are so many things to talk to him, things to say, things to say, things to hear, things to hear. However……

 --But my father doesn't know my feelings
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't talk anything to us. One word that put such feelings went through me and Maam. And neither me nor Maam could refute anything. From the time of the last game, I was impressed by my own way of saying, "I do not know anything. I do not know what I do not know." And he was trying to fly away without looking back, as we had nothing to talk about. However……

 --older brother!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of this little child who yearns for him have a sad expression, and at the same time they have stared at me and Maam with a face saying, "How do you do it?" That alone proved that Earth loved this child. No way, we're jealous of this little child ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then something unexpected happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That goddess' daughter looks back and says something. Then Earth stopped, looked back, and smiled at his mouth.

 However, only Yamadile has a subtle face.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I thought that Yamadile was in control of those guys. But isn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the earth descended on a remote islet, which was in sight. It's like trying to intercept us.

 Earth. Goddess. Twink. Yamidile. Pegasus. Hippo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was nervous about me and Maam, wondering if we could fight us. Yamidile is there. I was expecting such a development.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, the spectacle of my son facing us alongside Yamidile showed inevitable chest pain.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it's impossible for me and Maam to be surprised. I had heard from Earth friends in advance that they had won the tournament and that Earth would marry the goddess of Kakuretaire, but here she was told, loudly, together with Yamidile. I did not think.

 ――Let's show blooming flower fields!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to further confuse us, the handsome man magically turned the whole area around his feet into a flower garden. You can't tell what's happening and what's meaningful because you don't feel any threats or tricks on the flower. If this is a war, I'm just skipping over Dokan for the time being, but that's not the case, and I and Ma-am are just confused. And for us ...

 --let's go!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth ran toward us. No sign of attack, no killing or hostility. But his eyes were aiming at something. I felt a strong will. And ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Daima / Killer / Crossover! !

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw Maam. No, I was shown. The area that the current earth has reached.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard that Earth won the tournament at Kakretaire, and even beat Yamadile. However, I and Ma-am thought it was "impossible" and decided that they had taken some measures. In a way, we knew more about Yamidile's power than Earth's. However, he knew well that Yamidile wasn't the only one who could win with "just a measure." So I thought Earth was stronger than we thought ... Despite that, we never expected that he had reached this point. I didn't know.

 “Earth. You …… the current movement…” “It was even more ridiculous than at the previous game …… you…”

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth ... Dad, you can usually use hits, swordsmanships, and magics for your opponents. I don't understand the principles and theories, but I was able to do something like "Oh, it looks like this?" I don't usually understand such a principle or reason-I understand only this.

 The steps of earthing today aren't just about practicing tricks or that kind of dimension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A bloody effort. It was a splendid and powerful movement that seemed to be unintentionally watched as I ran and ran and ran, repeated and repeated practice.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, after the last game, I regretted that when I ran out of the Imperial City after chasing him.

 It ’s not just the Great Demon Spiral. The skill, fist strength, and the handling of the legs in the previous game were all remarkable. The movements of fists and feet that were playing with Reval. There were no tricks. I noticed that the beautiful form, the honed movement, and the hard work were all very hard work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, his new move is much sharper than the previous game, a few months ago. Earth was even stronger, stronger, and running.
