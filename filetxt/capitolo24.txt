 After the Declaration of Victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I met my childhood friends again and had tea together for the first time in a long time… Without doing anything at all, being the first to leave, I returned to the mansion and started my special training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phantom sparring, I had forgotten how many times he’s killed me, and although the amount of time I resist him gradually increases, I’m still getting killed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hit the left jab then immediately back away and guard. Rather than hitting, be mindful of when to pull back and hold your ground! Your shoulders are too stiff. Loosen your strength. Predict your opponent’s movements by their feet, eyes, and shoulder muscles. If you only react after seeing it, no matter how many lives you have, tis not enough!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even when worn out strike with your fist! Your legs have ceased movement! Always move your feet lightly. Endless stepwork, ultimate footwork that fumbles the opponent…Magical Footwork is meaningless if you cannot pull it out when exhausted!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Let’s go…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Always be aware of the timing, your kicks are still too early! Get in the pocket with a quick step-in, the body, the upper, the hook…… Choose an effective fist depending on your situation!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I try to stumble Tre’ainar up by repeatedly speeding and slowing my footwork, I can’t because our levels are too different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I push forward without retreating, I don’t even mind dying, saying to myself, ‘I’ll land even one hit’, ‘I’ll have you eat a shot’, and ‘I’ll survive for longer even if for a second’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m a warrior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my head is cool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I was getting to be able to step into the last-ditch battle which seemed to wear out my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, heh… I’m beat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not just drop all of a sudden. Cool down.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A short pause after repeated sparring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I couldn’t land a blow on him, or change the color of his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m doing it a lot, but I don’t know if I’m really strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rest assured, you will grow more than you can imagine.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s words were clear, for I had shared my heart entirely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Your childhood friend might be a strong man that defeated a dragon, but after all, it was a wild dragon of the terran world. I once battled the Dragon King of Hades, strongest dragon in history and won. There is no doubt about it, because I say so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What!? The Dragon King of Hades is real? I thought it was a fantasy creature that appeared in fairy tales…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But… I think it would be best to adjust the contents of this phantom sparring little by little.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unexpected words from Tre’ainar who so far has constantly killed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s the sudden change in the wind? After all, I’m too weak to train myself…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At this rate, you will not be able to acquire the image of defeating your opponent. If you only face opponents who are superior, you will only have the image of losing and being killed. Hence you will lack confidence in yourself and flee from attacks on impulse.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I’m in the dark, I’m just confronting him recklessly, but eventually I expect that I won’t be able to do that with his guidance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a psychological matter, but troublesome when ingrained in instinct. I cannot make a step in this circumstance, for it may lead to you giving up at the first sign of danger and retreating.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m pretty impressed with the explanation in anticipation of the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You…… is this a leader’s experience?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No. …… Hmm, what? Am I too much of a good leader that you are surprised? I am different from Hiro, who struggles with raising a child. Not like a hero, what is a hero?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar sticks his chest out with a pompous face, but as usual I nodded accordingly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he is omnipotent, it’s only possible to go so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the great thing about this guy is not just his knowledge and theory. That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, if I want to build up the image of defeating my opponent, I’ll have some sturdy guy at the Academy as an opponent in a mock battle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, you will not!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My dear fellow, you are very dull. Is that all right? Until the last minute… or dare I say, until you fight the children of the heroes, keep hidden that you have come to use martial arts.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Why…? Perhaps I can prepare countermeasures by any chance…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is not the case! Is that all right? Imagine this situation.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Tre’ainar explains a scenario to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Alright, next is a confrontation between the children of the heroes! Earth, the son of hero Hiro. And I’m sorry to have kept you waiting! The swordsman that is already hailed as a hero, the leading hero candidate to lead the next generation! It is the appearance of ‘Sword Saint Successor’ Rebal!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Kyaaah, Mr. Rebal, good luck!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Um, then only Rebal can be my fiancé!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Well, I’m sure you can’t do anything about it, Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -After all, I wish our son was as good as Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Earth, you can’t beat me. Prepare to die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It will develop as such』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, it’s pretty messed up!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Oops, Earth doesn’t have any weapons, does he? Is this an indication of surrender?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Sloppy. Hey, Rebal, bury that 2nd place failure quickly so you and I can flirt!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -If only I were to serve Mr. Rebal rather than Little Man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Tsk, idiot dunce son of mine
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -No Mercy, Earth. Now watch as me and the princess flirt. As for Sadiz, I’ll get her as my concubine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no, no, Hell no! Oh, Rebal, you bastard, no, I’ll end the whole world!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Be quiet and listen! So, here it is! You present your biggest grin.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Grin…… Phew…… Everything seems to stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - What? Earth, what’s with those movements! Oh, my sword won’t hit!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I’ll make that handsome face look like an orc’s! Demon Cork Screw Blow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Buheeeee!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And the entire venue is stunned… After a short moment, the Empire is astonished!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 —Earth, so GREEEEAAAAAATTT!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So, how is it? To forgo the path of a magic swordsman, to aspire for power unrelated with his father or mother, and to show the battle and power, not as the Child of the Hero, but as ‘Earth Lagann’. Is this not ideal?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is it. The great thing about this is not only knowledge and theory, but also how much he can raise my feelings!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! Tre’ainar! I’m excited…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t stop trembling. I’ll show them all, the ones who have been disappointed with me so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t stop my elation from overflowing as I laughed at Tre’ainar’s smile, ‘How is it?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So, your sparring partner will be created by my “imagining”. Using 【Vier】. After Phantom Sparring, tis ‘Dream Sparring’ in a dream world. I will prepare goblins and beasts!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Come on and on! To beat that bastard!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do it. I’ll show it to everyone! My power! That I exist!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To that end, both lady-killer Rebal and the sh*tty princess will face death!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, the previous example was a little exaggerated… No, I care not. Seems he has acquired the bloodlust he needs for the struggle.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got it! I’ll kill you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, seeing as sparring will have numerous variations in the future, today we shall skip to the next training… on to Forbidden Spells』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-oh… That’s from the other day…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. The magic technique I demonstrated during 【Vier】. You should be up to task for it. This will be quite painful, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, pain? As if, bring it on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Such spirit. Well then…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to win. No, I will win. In that case, what’s a little pain…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There was an acupuncture set among the items I had you purchase on the first day, right? Prepare that. I shall stab them in your body later.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 N-No pain… No gain…… No…… pain… Even if…
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
