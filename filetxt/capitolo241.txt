 Honey's friends and Princess Fiansei are fighting a barren battle. But yeah ... I'm going to give the ceremony with a crochet tail ... oh, but then the ceremony is likely to be ahead of time. And everyone in this country seems to want to marry Honey and her daughter, Kron. She seems to be the biggest rival at the moment, and she's a pretty strong enemy. However, the stronger the opponent is, the more it burns. But that's it ...

 What do you think of this sadness, which originally seemed to be the strongest barrier? I am still watching Princess Fiansay with a warm gaze. It's like a gentle sister.

 The charming smile that made me feel a little nervous even though I was a woman was enough to recognize that she was also the biggest and strongest barrier for me. I sweat a little cold on my back.

 One woman stood there. An older woman with long brown hair tied behind her head with a slightly worn-out white ribbon, and with a feeling of cuteness and matureness. It's not fat, but it's so plump, plump and pleasing, attractive thighs, buttocks, mu, mummy, cho, oh, big, like a white-based coat. The cape is worn and the atmosphere is very invisible to the inhabitants of this country.
