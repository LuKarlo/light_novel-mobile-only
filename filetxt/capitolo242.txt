<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 At the same time, one of the many princes who grew in genjutsu sounded a finger flute.

 "Fufufu. Originally this child is also a Pegasus of the Tenku tribe ... this is right!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Yamidelay! You should fight fairly! What's going on with Earth again?"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 so. There is no way for them to fly anymore. There is no way to chase us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, this means that someone has to come to this remote island to pick them up or swim, or they can't go out of the island.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, fucking! I'll chase you when I'm done! Swim in the sea!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Assuming you swim and chase after hundreds of steps ...

 Kron's eyes glowed. At that moment, me, Amae, Yamadile, and Pegasus …… Prince and Pegasus …… Kron and Hirua…

 "Ge ... what ?!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-so ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the same vision as the alter ego prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is an elaborate and intense genjutsu that cannot be distinguished from the real thing at first glance.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hundreds of more visions, all of us in the same shape, appeared all over the sky, and all flew in all directions.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 As a result, we all intactly took only Amae from his father and mother, even stealing them.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was comfortable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, it may be bad for me to say this while holding an innocent child like Amae ... but I'm sorry ... I can't control it.

 "How is Kuhahahahahaha! You saw, father! Mom! Zamaa ~ !!!
