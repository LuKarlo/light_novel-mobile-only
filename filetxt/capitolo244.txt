 While holding the reins and looking straight ahead, Yamidile dares to hit a harsh word against Amae clinging to my chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words go further through Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not special that you've been spoiled like you've always liked it. A goose, a horsetail, a cari, and a spit that happened to protect you, who just lost their parents and weren't aware It was just so friendly. "

 I don't know how small and young Amae can understand Yamadile's words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at least you know that Yamidile is saying harsh words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Amae is so trembling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 T ran s l a t e d b y Jpm t l.c o ｍ To be honest, I can only persuade Amae with a promise that I can't guarantee, while comforting Amae as little as possible.

 Of course, I love Amae as much as I do, and so is Kron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you really persuade Amae, you have to teach reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, Amae will cry more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Yamadile bought the role himself and left.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then ... the priests, the goddesses ... and the Onii-chan ... don't you come back?"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At last, Amae lifted her body from me who was clinging, turned her back, reached out to Yamidile, who was driving a horse, and shook her back and forth.

 "Amae ... Did you hate me? Amae ... Is she a child you don't need?"
