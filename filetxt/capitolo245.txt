<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rampage in the heavens, fighting the prince and the king of the sky, fighting against Paripi, surpassing his father and mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we and Amae pledged to work harder and stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I myself was nervous and my consciousness was broken.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Hah !?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sorry, it's dangerous. Will you fall if you suddenly move?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I must have been riding behind Yamadile, holding Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, what I can hear right now is the prince's voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the wind cuts the skin a bit chilly. Is it still over the sky?

 "Hello, good morning."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... What, what ...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehehe, I hate Yamadile from leaning on you ... so I was supporting you on your sleep."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the prince's face smiling while looking down at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That! Nuh !? Oh, I'm in what position ...?!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, here, it's dangerous if you get upset--"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still empty? Is this on a horse? Is the princess hugged by the prince?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know the situation yet, but I felt embarrassed and twisted myself in a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as he was in a good position, I quickly lost balance and slipped out of the prince's arm and almost fell off the horse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nu, Abu!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hurriedly stretched out my hands and grabbed the prince's body anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's fine to grab the prince's body in a hurry, but my right hand slips between the buttons on the prince's jacket ... Something that is delicate, hard or soft ... My left hand sticks into the prince's pants ... that? Nothing ... Nani ... Ney?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, boy ... I'm used to touching girls and girls ... but this is the first time I'm touching a boy ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, oh ... the prince ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, by the way, that's what the prince feels in my hands ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? Earth, are you touching Prince's pussy?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan, what are you doing?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuh? Hey, Earth Lagan, what are you touching at these times! If you want to touch them, you will have Kron-sama!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the face of Kyoton, Klon and Amae, and Jamidile with Jito eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 that? Amae is suddenly hugged by Kron's knee and is behind Hirua?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps I was on Yamadile's back, but is it a prince now? why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No ... I don't care about saying that clearly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The important thing is that now I'm a prince who blushes with a blush while looking at me ... No ... Ikemen ... Oh, princess ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is a secret to my cute flowers. If I get touched by a boy, they will go crazy."

 How shocking at such times! I apologize for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Isn't it still noticeable?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the trainer sighed as if I was amazed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Trainer, oh, you, did you notice? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Observing power is good. That's why women complain about being insensitive. '

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, because ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I remembered that there was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the prince's cheek that still has a little bruise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hit ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "That ... cheeks ... but ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Hey"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I was sorry, the prince smiled and decopined me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You must understand that some people in this world do not want to be treated as princesses, regardless of their biological gender."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Nu ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is a worthwhile blow that struck you head on, and made me realize my immatureness. If you apologized, I would be miserable and stop it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The prince says that it's not insincere that I've been beaten at all, but rather proud and conversely, apologizing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not just the goddess ... and your cute little sister ... I'll be stronger and stronger ... I'll continue to improve myself. So if I apologize, I'm not going to forgive me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey ... I don't want to be a princess ... but ... I'm the only woman I've ever met."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the true princess, Fiansei, and I don't want Saddis, who stayed with me for a long time, and even Shinob and Kron, to just be protected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, they are taking the initiative in the battle and trying to fight side by side, regardless of the feelings of men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I was able to understand the prince's words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Kron was in sync with the conversation between me and the prince.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I understand the prince's feelings, too. I also met Earth and knew that I wanted to fight together rather than being able to be protected ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to Kron's strong words, Amae held on Kron's knee raised his hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "older brother"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan ... Amae ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……Work hard……"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you do your best ...... everyone will be together again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A word after seriously thinking about Yamadile and our words like Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until a while ago, I was parting and crying, and I still don't want to part with us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But while she was about to cry, she still said so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, let's do our best! If Amae becomes stronger, he'll be invincible. Nothing scary!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard those words, I felt refreshed that I could go ahead with peace of mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm ... Earth Lagann ... Amae is fine, but ... at least I want to be the only one who can be protected except for Clon-sama ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile, who was looking forward with a lonely face, muttered like grudges.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard those words, I laughed involuntarily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhahah, how can you do it? Because, that Kron wants to protect you most ... because you are."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuu !?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Loss of power and she's just a winged woman ... you're a hated bounty hunter from all over the world ... but Kron said she would protect you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why we don't need it! I'm safe even if Kron-sama is safe, and if you protect Kron-sama, then ... I lose my strength, and I'm afraid I'll protect myself as if I'm a stomach."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, as the prince says, regardless of man or woman, everyone is going to be strong, with one exception.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of the loss of power, she has become a princess protected from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is the current Yamadile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that is inevitable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In exchange for that, Yamadile was released.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, maybe, though you have sealed your magical powers and evil eyes, I think that even if you fight with elementary, Yamidile will be able to lightly knock off any other opponent ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, Yamidile. For some reason, you've got to be on the side to be protected from now on, but you're not saying that your feet or nuisance or something like that, but Kron wants to protect it. Protect me quietly. ''
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But! Let's make it work!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, not just Kron alone"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, surely if you're traveling with both Yamidile and Kron, I'm too anxious to worry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that is not the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm there too!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, there is Hirua.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hirua signed with me and Kron, but will stay with Kron and Yamadile for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm not saying Hirua ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, Hirua will follow along with Kron ... but that's not all. From now on, it seems like a man is by your side wanting to help you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't like the information and suggestion of Paripi ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boy. I can see you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the continent was finally visible in our field of view, which had only had the entire sea so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the very end of the continent, it's the territory of the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can see several ships anchored in what appears to be a small port town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is the “meeting place”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we each have a new departure there.
