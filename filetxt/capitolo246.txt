 At that time, Kron and Amae, who were running with excitement, suddenly stopped.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron looks around as if she is nervous, and Amae clings to Kron's feet as if she was a little scared.

 However, not everyone talks, nor does it come with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is a matter of course for me, but for Cron and Amae, I would have never experienced it before.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 This is not a cullet, so unlike anyone who boasts a bounty, no one knows about Kron and Amae, even if he wants to expose his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, just walking in the town of Kakuretaire, Kron was bowed and moved by many.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae just walked through the city, and the friendly town guys smiled and gave them sweets and fruits. Tran slate d by jpｍtl.coｍ

 "Is it even better now?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "I'm sorry."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron and Amae hold my fist tightly, saying that it's okay to be nervous and make my expression a little stiff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it is natural to be nervous, but if you seem to be nervous in such a small town, Kron may be a little hard from now on.

 On the other hand, the person himself, Kron, nodded with a rather interesting nod, advising Amae who is crazy.

 "Yeah, Yamidile. I'll do my best to protect Yamidile, but I don't know about the outside world. So please tell me a lot."

 It was unfortunate fortunate that no one knew that Yamadile was a bounty.

 That rule is nothing wrong.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have been taught the rules.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about four or five years old ... I was taught by a teacher in a kindergarten ... So, did you always hold your hands to Fiansay?

 "And raise your hand! Yes!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Klon and Amae hold hands and cross the road with a chest of "Ehen."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Inhabitants who gathered around them are snarling and giggle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Yes, I'm very good, Kron!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Yamadile is pleased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's dangerous. Yamidile doesn't get tangled when cron is involved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it would be a little worrisome if you were just two people.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But ... about that ...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, I'm not gathering in the middle of the road!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's Hayada's street!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A single carriage that runs farther from the other, with a lot more speed than the carriage loaded with fish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is a fast-loading carriage that makes it a business to load luggage and deliver it to another land.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Basically, it is "not stop" to the destination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? Something is coming, but I'm raising my hand this way!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When a quick load arrives, pedestrians usually vacate the road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Residents accustomed to it do not seem particularly panicked and go back quickly to make a fast-loading road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Kron and Amae don't know it ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nu ... that human, I don't feel like stopping!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, already!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He raises his hand with a grinning face, but he is not thinking of stopping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here, Kron. Amae, here because it's dangerous!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? But earth ... we're raising our hands? We were walking first?"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm in a hurry and pull Kron and Amae's hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as he was still sloppy, the fast-loading person finally noticed this situation and applied a sudden brake to stop in front of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey! What are you going to do, youth!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A middle-aged old man with bad screams roars and shouts at us.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Oh, when you're done, give me a drink!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Thank you, hey, this guy. You can understand the story, brother. Hey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man appeared like a breeze and flirted, laughing in good mood, handing over his liquor bottle to his uncle, and laughing at each other and squeezing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The merry quick load ran again and went in no time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the man who appeared turned to us ...

 As soon as he sees the man's face, Klon and others startle.

 The man laughs again, rubbing his nose with his finger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey ... well, it's been a long time, Master. And I've gotten a lot of strong eyes, little sister! And ..."

 "Brothers, are you listening roughly? Well done!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is a tall man wearing a white long coat and white hat.

 The bad guy stood with a powerful smile and even more glaring eyes.
