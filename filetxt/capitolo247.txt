 It's my first reunion in a few months.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it wouldn't be for them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You are ... bro! Isn't bro !?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ... bro ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron ran up with a full smile to Bro, who appeared and laughed with a smile, and Amae ran up with a surprised face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Cool, I'm sorry, my sister! And ... Are you Amae? Oh, you're still small."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, bro! This is a real bro!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Amae, I'm bigger. Tran sl a ted b y Jpmt l.ｃom

 A bro stroking their heads with their hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no, bro!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "N, stop! N! Bro, stop!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron seems to be tickling it, and Amae looks sulky, but not likely to be full.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Your sister. Are you fine? And ... I said earlier, you have really strong eyes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is that so? Promise with you ..." It's good to be a good child, but I'm going to be strong. "... I'm happy if you can fulfill that promise."
</div>

 "Oh! There were various things ... good encounters" Tr ans lat ed b y jp mt l .ｃ om

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes! I know love!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'm glad that you are! I'm relieved to hear your Koibana!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw the sight of them together for the first time, but suddenly the sight looked natural and warm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He ... is your friend?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm. Isn't he a good guy ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, he is the first prince to meet Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Bro is a guy who tries to enter the inside of a person calmly, so there are places that are crazy, but it is not a bad guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey Earth Lagann"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You said you wouldn't act with us in the future ... I guess you're going to have him protect Kron-sama instead of you?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kron ... Well, Klong and you, both."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile looked frustrated, as if she laughed at her bro with her nose and looked down. T ra ns la ted b y Jp m tl.coｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that was the proposal from Paripi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bro is protected by Mikado's Gee in Cantidan and seems to have been in the imperial city ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Mikado?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, but Koman ... oh, it's like my former classmate's parent who was a spy of Parisi, had worked out the back and released Bro before leaving the Imperial City. I'll meet with Bro here and have them act with you in the future. ''
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Nu ... what ... I was talking about that with Paripi ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This proposal was made when talking to Paripi through the magic crystal in the heavenly world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously, following his suggestion would be annoying, but considering the future of the Klongs, I thought that having someone with Bro would be more secure, so I decided to take it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Yamidile heard the story and had a subtle face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see ... but ... it's sloppy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you dissatisfied with me? Master?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't make me laugh, bro. You jumped out of the dojo and fell in love with the outside world ... Earth Lagan, and much worse than geese, would you protect us?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile's harsh words made Buro smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's cool, it's still tough, my teacher is"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think it's anymore! I don't think there is such a way! Bro is very reliable?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, I'm good, my sister. I know my power." T r a nslate d by Ｊpｍt l.com
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron tried to get angry by inflating his cheek at Yamidile's words, but Bro stopped it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right, Master. I jumped out. By seeing the outside world where Master came, ... I want to know the same world ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And I realized how big the adults, the world, the power and the society were, and at the same time I knew how small I was."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm. Then--"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamadile's words are correct in a way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few months ago, I have won a Thaiman with Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro is not weak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's exactly what compared to the six-hawk class like Paripi and Yamadile, but ... it's not there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But, master. I'm still weak today. With a simple fighting power, the difference between my brother and my brother would have been more in recent months. I don't even have an eye. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ... you know?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But ..."

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I've been living out of it, and I've been hanging out on the front and back and getting along with a lot of guys ... I'm going to learn how to get in trouble ... how to get it right ... and how to enjoy it." T ra ns l a ted by ｊp ｍ t l .co ｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro has experience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I live in the world and society, both front and back, more than anyone else here, including me, and sometimes I have troubles with them, and I'm getting along well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is the experience and knowledge that Yamidile, who had been in Kakretaire almost since the war, did not have.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, what you need is not only the ability to protect Yamidile and Kron from trouble, but also someone who can do it well so that it doesn't cause trouble in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly he was a fighter who was originally out of the world, but he had many friends and dating with various adults.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he enjoyed and lived on it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, behind the scenes I was caught up in various ways and had strange intentions and policies, but if Kron and Yamidile are involved, it is clear what this priority is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Of course, when I say Iza, I'll be strong enough to stretch out and protect you. But now I'm going to be with you ... do you enjoy it? Of course, don't forget-I carry my heavy luggage with me. ''
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……what?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I feel from the current bro is completely different from what seems to be a bad intention that is meaningless as before, that is, a man's selfishness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a certain heat in those words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bro ... you're ... a little bit different? Sometimes I came out of the Kletter tail and returned to the dojo with outsiders for a short period of training, but at that time it was a bit bad While sticking to the way of life ... burned out by the destruction of the mafia ... ... I had more rotten eyes ... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile also felt the heat of Bro and expressed a somewhat mysterious expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to that question, Bro glanced at me ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well ... of course ... I forgot the beginning when I jumped out into the outside world, and rotten and rotten me .... I beat it all the way and gave me guidance ... I met the best squid nigga I'm sorry! "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... Num ... mu ... mumm ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The straight, gleaming eyes were not found in the bro that was smoking at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, this is the original bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile was pressed by the heat and said nothing more, and Bro looked at me again, laughed and smiled and thrust her thumb up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a bit itchy, but I once again thought that the current bro could be left with confidence, so I laughed and nodded back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
