 That's right. Especially in a very developed country, more people will know about Yamidile.

 "Kuha ... I'm full of Rokuha, so I don't want to be involved for a while ..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidile doesn't really care for me or shake hands or hug with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not a substitute, but a light tip.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally ...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently I couldn't stand it at the end, but I still laughed at the end, and that alone made me feel at ease from the bottom of my heart.

 The prince also sends a signal to Pegasus, on which he is riding, and the other one on which his father is riding, and flies to the sky.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Amae! Don't stuff me!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 The goal "to the end of the world" that we pledged three months ago has not yet been achieved.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Three months ago, he was taken away by Yamadile and set foot in another country, but this time he will cross this sea on his own and go to a different country.

 And the next destination is

 Yes, the original plan is to drop Yamidile and Kron here and join Buro.

 After doing that, I was going to have the prince send me to my next destination.
