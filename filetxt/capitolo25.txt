<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was once again within the world of Fantasy Magic, 【Vier】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now, you will learn the secrets of the magic techniques I demonstrated the other day… Then, to get you ready.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual, my body still aches considerably with ladder training and phantom sparring, but if I keep at it for a few days, I feel I’ll gradually get used to the training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the first day, I could only do ladders and phantom sparring, but today I was able to train forbidden spells.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, like Tre’ainar did before, we’ve begun Forbidden spells training within 【Vier】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「First of all, as basic knowledge…… Magic is a phenomenon that drifts in the air, enters and exits the body through conduits called ‘Magic Holes’ and is incorporated into the body’s ‘Magic Tank’ for storage, fastening, and release through the magic holes as necessary. You know this, do you not?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before teaching forbidden spells, Tre’ainar started talking about the basics of magic, as if to confirm my knowledge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was listening obediently though it was a subject I’m familiar with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I am an Academy student, aren’t I? I understood it even as a kid.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm. Then you must be aware that [Capacity of the Magic Storage Tank = Magic Capacity]. However, you can also understand that [Magic Capacity = Magic Power] does not hold.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. That’s the formula of [Magic Emission Amount + Degree of Magic Discipline = Magic Power], right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Correct. In other words, regardless of the Magic Capacity, tis possible to release powerful magic by raising the degree of discipline or even the ‘Magic Emission Amount’. That makes it easier for the tank to empty quickly, but aside from that, how do you ‘Increase the Amount of Magic Emission’?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s right,…… To be precise, ‘how much you can open the magic holes of the whole body”…… Right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis so. Rather than putting air into a bag and making just one small hole to get a little air out tis better to make a lot of holes. In other words, it means that [Magic Emission Amount = Number of Open Magic Holes].」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the basis of magic theory that is learned in the Academy. I nodded so far as I could understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then, do you know how many [Magic Holes] are present in the whole body, regardless of whether they are open or not?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t answer the question accurately. Or rather, it’s because it has not become clear even with modern magic medicine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if you average the number of magic holes that are opened……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I don’t know. However, if it is ‘open’, about 10 in the ordinary person. The average number for Academy students was 20. In a medical checkup mine was 30 and Fu’s was 60.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, that is the way it is.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, strong magic cannot be released just by having a large capacity of magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power of magic depends on how many holes you have opened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Even magic training can improve power, but there is a limit to that. Life cannot release more magic than can be released from its magic hole. And the number of magic holes that are opened is different for each person… The more you have, the more talented you are, tis especially true of mage ancestry.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Okay…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And the capacity of the magic tank is also different for each person. In other words, the open magic holes and the magic tank capacity… meaning, those who are born with both the amount of magic emission and the magic capacity… they are talented…… that, we refer as genius.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that is irreversible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the number of my magic holes is half of that of Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the princess had 50.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But there are some people in the world who are a little out of balance. Those who have a lot of magic capacity, but little magic power, even those who have a lot of magic power emissions, but limited capacity’ and so on.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ignoring the level of discipline for now… let’s quantify the magic capacity of the body, and make the number of magic holes a numerical value of the amount of magic emission. In that case, for example…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the conversation went on, and Tre’ainar created a blackboard in this fantasy space with his imagination and wrote something out in chalk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, you’re really like a teacher, aren’t you? [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In this case, Example 1 has more magic capacity than Example 2, and can unleash the Bit Class magic of consumption 20 five times. On the other hand, Example 2 has only half of the magic capacity of Example 1. But if only one time, tis possible to release more powerful magic than in Example 1.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know this explanation. In other words, just because you have a lot of magic, there is no point if you don’t have the power to release it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now, if you were to quantify the boy named Fu earlier and yourself. This is what happens.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And, well, it will be as such…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s how it is… normally I would just agree, but wait a minute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wait, damnit! Then, in terms of both amount of emission and magic capacity I’m losing, so I can’t win!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Right. In a magical battle, tis almost certainly impossible to win as you are now.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You cannot win on your own now. First of all, firmly face this reality, and listen to the rest of the story.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, let me know where I stand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when presented with the numbers in this way, the difference is clear and painful, but it also puts the reality into my hands, I need to become stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On top of that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「With respect to magic capacity and the amount of magic emission, one can increase it with some training, but you cannot dramatically increase both in a short time. However, if tis only the amount of magic emission, this can be done in two months.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「How is this?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The amount of magic emission is tripled!? It’ll only give one shot, but can release magic stronger than Fu’s!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, what is Giga class really!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「N-No way, how do you do it? You can increase the amount of magic emission with a certain degree of discipline, but as you have said earlier, when it comes to magic capacity, it has more to do with talent!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It can be done. The trick is to ‘increase the number of magic holes that are opened’ by taking over the formula of [Amount of Magic Emission = Number of Open Magic Holes].」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Increase the number of opened magic holes. Certainly, it is theoretically possible to increase the amount of magic emission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The number of open magic holes is usually several dozen, but the number of ‘closed magic holes’ in the human body is actually several hundred or more. Originally, it would require long periods of exercise to gradually open them up… But if we cooperate, we can force them to open in a short time.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「S-Such a thing…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it shouldn’t be that easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Can it be done in two months?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Usually, years of training. And also talent is combined together to open them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in two months?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis possible. You forcibly open the closed magic holes.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Are you serious…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Now that I am here, tis possible.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I even felt reliance on Tre’ainar’s words, who asserted that it was possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if this Great Demon King can really do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, child. I shall use the acupuncture set that you bought on the first day.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah… th-that’s no way…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「With my omnipotence and omniscient eyes… I can accurately determine the positions of closed magic holes throughout your body. The closed magic hole possesses a subtle irregularity in it. You will have to stick an acupuncture needle through it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Let the magic flow there, stimulate the closed magic hole, and force it open. That method is most effective.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The method presented was to pierce acupuncture into the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or something like that…… Acupuncture pierced in my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Keep in mind. Humans in the East also use acupuncture as a form of medical treatment… But… the only way to force open a closed magic hole, is not through treatment… tis restructuring.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Does it hurt?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Do you believe this would come without any difficulty? Not to mention, the geniuses who make an effort.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed I’m being told to clench my teeth and endure it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Due to the severity of the pain, opening one or two holes a day is the limit. But if you repeat this for a month, you should be able to achieve this number in theory.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So! ……d-does it hurt?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, as an example…… I force it between the nail and finger-」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I don’t want to hear iiiiiiit!」 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They stick acupuncture in their bodies. Moreover, it seems considerably painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Damn it, seriously… uh.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But without at least that much magical power, you cannot perform techniques such as the Devil Spiral Break that I showed you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Are you?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, the techniques to contain the magic power in the body’s tank and control it freely… 【Great Demon Super Evolution · Breakthrough】 bloom!」 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does it hurt? But if I endure it, I can do that too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Does~ does it hurt… ah~… But …」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I think this is one of the risks. Even for a shortcut, I doubt power can be obtained easily. You have to overcome intense pain. But that is why the fact that you have endured the pain will be the backbone that will support you later.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To gain power in a short time, it is natural that a reasonable price is necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the pain does not end only today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 According to the conversation, we’ll keep doing it for a month.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A month…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Uh… That? Sorry…… It’s not too big a deal, so I guess it was disappointing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, the figure of Fu is in my head. It was repeated in my head many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yes? I’m sorry, I was surprised that it wasn’t too big a deal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gradually changed little by little……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Heeeey, you guys are surprised to see the power of my magic! Nooow, which woman do I play with todaaaaay ♪? [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, that is too much of an exaggeration. You are not keeping to the model anymore, are you? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, that pompous baby face making everyone go ‘KyahKyah’ annoys me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to humiliate him a bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Let’s do iiiiiiiiiittt!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Then, release the spell and get up! I shall guide you to the precise points.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nuoooooooh!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I decided to clench my teeth and endure it, and then lifted 【Vier】 and returned to reality.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, ready? Here and here. Thrust it in, go!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……it’s bullsh*t after all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Never mind that, a little. Just the tip… little by little…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little by little… Or…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『YAH!! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Higu! …… Aagh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I applied acupuncture needle at the point I was told to, I got scared. As I just held acupuncture in my hand, Tre’ainar startled me from behind, and I was so surprised it got to the root…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gag gyu gah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My body burst open suddenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My internal organs seemed to explode.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My whole body is burning hot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sensation like all of my nerves are exposed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel the flow of pulsating blood fluttering like the sound of my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is a wound being gouged with a blunt blade?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feeling of being stabbed by a rat-backed spine in the eyeball and crotch?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s pain I’ve never experienced before, yet such intense pain darts all over. [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, Gugya, Gagagu Agyaaaaaah!?“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you bite on a towel in your mouth like a gag and desperately curb your screams, your sweat, tears, and pain won’t stop at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fugu-uh, fugu-u-! Gu, Guuuuuuufufufufufufufu-!!!!“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hell…… This is hell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Penance!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I tell you, to not call this effort, it may as well be called penance, right? A man who desires strength calls the pain he suffers to become strong penance. Then, think of this as a prerequisite and overcome it! Imagine yourself getting stronger and think of it as the price to get there! 』 [6]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I, ended up…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little Man? I heard a strange voice, but what’s going on……? Lil’ Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stabbed myself with acupuncture until Sadiz rushed where I was screaming in the garden.

 Author’s Note

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your help.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I reread the story five times now, but the author didn’t understand it either.

 It is difficult to express.

 So, at level 1 there is only MP30, but we’d like to use the Zi● Spark with MP25 consumption only once.

 No, I really want writing skills…
