 My own son pushed me out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn't just a coincidence that it was just a hit on Maghre or the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously we were entangled in measures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sons of Cacletail said Earth beat Yamidilee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can even put up a measure to take two of me and Hiiro in your hand, maybe that's true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, that move that made us both buttcake. It's all because that thing has as much power as it can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ground became stronger. I grew up. And it still doesn't show us the bottom of it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We stupid couples can't take any other options than to chase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For starters, just get off the deserted island and go to the other shore... swim.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no more, no more whales, no more whales. Come and get us. Aah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Torah!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of us move our hands and butt-foot, just going straight for the other shore. T r an s l a t e d by ｊp ｍ t l.c om
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost ran into a giant fish trying to swallow us along the way, but I kick it all in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, Maam! Almost there, we'll reach the shore of Bettrail!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, it's last-minute! Look, even if I'm pitiful enough to be rolled over by my son a little further away from the actual battle, I'm not old enough to be able to swim! I'm seventeen forever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My son refused me, got me out, and I went again right in front of him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not us going home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We went to the other shore, dogging both of us nonstop...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "haha...... dude...... and they're both not cool"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what? Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A voice laughing at us now as funny could be heard from above us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the sea, isn't it? From the top......?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Hiiro and I look up at the same time, there's...

 "Ah!? T ra nslat e d b y jpm tl .c o ｍ

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, are you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There floated a woman with long brown hair tucked behind her back, woven with bright white long coats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We know the woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Much more adult than we know, and our bodies are growing bigger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I cherished that shadow, and above all, the ribbon, from "when you were with us", although it was a little tedious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You...... espi!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A companion who once deposited his life and soul together and fought the Demon King's army led by that Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ohisa. Hiiro... Maam... I don't know... sounds stupid"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was still less than ten years old at the time, a hero with the same titles of seven brave men as me and Hiiro, who made his name heard of the world with numerous fights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you, where have you been?! He said he disappeared from the kingdom of Betrayal... and that Mikado's Jee would never know where you were..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right, don't explain it properly...... ahhh, but ahhh, no more!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Daughter Though I thought there were so many things I had to ask about this...... something else went wrong at the same time for both me and Hiiro. That should be a priority no matter what you do...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ra n s lat ed by jpm t l.c om "Damn...... but Espi. I have no idea what's going on, what you're thinking, or what you've been up to, but I'm sorry! We're in a hurry right now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! You remember that, too? Take our son, Earth. You held me when I was a baby, didn't you? He's running away from home now... and now he's acting like a Yamidilee!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Earth.

 Espi is also missing again for the first time in years. Valued companion. I've been looking for you. I know that.

 But now we...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi said something unexpected. Espi... you know a series of flows?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The worst man to make my sister cry is apparently running around, isn't he?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Hehe, don't you know? That I... make the man who makes my sister cry Yursanai."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, something disastrous is overflowing from the nickel and smiling espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, eh? Don't you forgive the man who makes your sister cry?... Was she like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Hiiro?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah. Sure, Espi was like a sister to us. I mean, I thought more like a sister than a buddy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But... I can't believe there was such a side to it... but... for Espi, my brother and so on... there was something definite about it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, wait, wait! I don't know, do I? I don't... relate..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Right, right?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh... I know... I don't... should..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I quickly shake my neck out of the ocean in a hurry that I didn't even notice the hiiro......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Uh-huh... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's nothing wrong with us? Such a complacent thought was disappointed and rejected by my beloved son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I couldn't even affirm that Hiiro wasn't easily "on my mind," and I felt subtle, too, trying to rush back a little bit to the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha, you're getting boring, Hiiro and Maam"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Colour...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I used to think nothing, I did stupid things with the idea of action before I thought, and still had great results. And now I don't know anything about my blood-connected child... and I'm worried about my missing head... and I'm losing my confidence... and I can't think from the old two."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi laughing cold as he frightened us. As if you are disappointed in us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a long time, that kid has been a little younger than us, but there have also been places where he's a little grown up from that "birth," and there have been times when he laughed at us like he was a jerk to do something stupid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But laughing so cold...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Have I changed? Hiiro...... Maam......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is it the same? Me too... just like Hiiro and Maam... maybe I'm a boring adult."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I can't believe I'm laughing so lonely... staring so far away... thinking about what... looking at what... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi... we want to go after our son"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... you are now... something... troubled too? Something that needs our help…"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It has been decided to give priority.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I haven't seen him in years and I can't believe that Espi, who's totally grown up, has this look... something... something we don't know...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's okay. I don't need your help, and I'm not in any trouble. But... even if I think for myself that I'm a little grown up... because I'm getting nervous... do I look that way?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Because... soon my hopes will come true... in a few more days... if he goes to that 'ruin'"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Want? What do you mean? You whine about all the thoughtful things and you don't tell us what they mean as if.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It also looks like an attitude that has nothing to do with us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, you're going now? The two people who lack exercise just have to swim some more. Until then... I hope you don't choke around him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi laughed again with Xuri, and turned in the direction of the day after tomorrow so as to turn his back on us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Espi! What! Are you gonna leave us like this? I mean, who is he? No way, you're not grounded!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, say espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tell me, if you think you can tell me anything, it's a big mistake, right? That's why you're rebelling against your adolescent son, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven't seen him at all in the last few years, but it's as if he knows everything that's happened to us... but without the way he tells us anything about it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm here today because I just came to see the two of you on a whim. Or to relieve the tension of what's about to happen… Anyway, bye."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hey!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't even glance at us as it is, it flew away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the Seven Brave Men, they defeated the Great Demon King and told me he was the hero who saved the world... now... against something happening around Earth, it's not like it's outside a mosquito net!
