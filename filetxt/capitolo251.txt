<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used to play magical yoga in the dojo of Cacletail, and fight in the precarious state of the scaffolding, even in Yamidilee fights, so I didn't think it was a big deal.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But unexpectedly, I lost my balance.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh heh heh, what do you say? Unlike yoga, which you do on a dojo floor with a solid scaffold, or in combat, where you were able to fine-tune your body's balance by constantly moving your feet, it would be hard to maintain your balance without moving a single step in a situation where the scaffold is unstable, wouldn't it?

 Honestly, even though I defeated Mr. Macho and won the tournament, with the help of Trayna, I still come out with a new workout this way, even though I said I was a little more confident in myself by defeating Yamidilet and Paris.

 While I was still ashamed of this situation where not a single fish could be caught, I tried to excuse myself by looking at a cheap rod that the sailor's old man lent me, which was also easy to build, but which Traina said was extra "dude".

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow. This is how you work out your sense of balance, but also your instantaneous power to pull up without missing a moment when the float sinks, right?
