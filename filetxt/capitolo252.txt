 Sometimes I was surprised that the theme of the new training was magical power, which I honestly didn't expect, but at the same time I was excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh... magic ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have so far met and developed various moves in my training with Trayna.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fist fighting. Breakthrough. The Great Demon Spiral. Magical footwork. Demonic breathing. Earth Miss Direction Shuffle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just that it's a move, but it was like technology.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a kid, I was aspiring to be a magic swordsman, but I wasn't at all admired for something called a wizard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the kind of ambition anyone has for once, like, "Everybody's amazed at the big magic."

 That's how Trayna the Great Demon teaches me magic. Tra n slat e d by Ｊp ｍt l .ｃo m

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can't be excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you learn magic...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Huh? You mean unbelievable... that my magic is too weak to believe, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's surface cool, hey in my heart!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - This is... the Giga-Class beyond the Mega-Class... and yet another Terra Class beyond!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, this kind of thing, that's what you can do!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Oh, no!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna denied my covert intentions as if she had been stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Cause now you can fire magic in a demonic breath, but now your magic capacity... you can't use Terra yet.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought I'd teach you Giga-Class magic in Cacletail for once, but I think it's better to polish the Great Devil's Spiral if it's a Giga-Class force because of its power and previous experience."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even if I mastered the Giga-Class, I'm thinking of going through the order because your feeling right now is that 'even if I can activate it, I can spare it'"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna said a somewhat meaningful word that simply lacked my magic or was beyond my senses right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't do Terra, but can I activate Giga right now? But you don't have the feeling you need...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But your delusions don't make sense, do they? After that, when they first confronted the Hiiro and the Seven Brave Men, they lost their hips because of the rest of the magic. I told them something like, 'Now they're just bits,' and they were comfortable when they were pale '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... well, you were so out of digit..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Next time I'll show you the rest of my magic when I spar in the world of dreams"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, that was a lot for the first time I met you!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Not again then and now. Though you have the extra help, you have become strong enough to leave the sixth championship. If you are now... No, because you are now, you might be more specific about how amazing the rest of the magic is.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ra n s l at e d b y Jpｍ tl .ｃo ｍ Ask me, when we did meet, I had too much strength difference with Trayna to just say, "I don't know, but it's amazing".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now that I'm somewhat stronger, do you mean I might know how "amazing" I am about Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt kind of praised for turning away, and it smelled a little lit up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'And... with an improved sense of magic, we will be able to understand more deeply...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Duh, duh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can it also be called training that will allow you to understand Traina more deeply?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it sounded a little funny, and I laughed, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Besides... since my next destination is... the site of Sisonotami, once also known as the Sanctuary of the Magic on Earth... dashi'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You didn't really try to hear the details from me, but this guy told me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The city that Traina once destroyed with her own hands. Home of Saddis. The land where Thaddess lost everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn't deserve to say anything about when it happened in the war, and I didn't want to get awkward with this guy like that, so I was off topic...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, no... the ruins deep underground in the land... right? What you want to see."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T r a nsla ted by Ｊp mt l .co m "Uhm. A ruin that lasted indefinitely deep... the deepest part couldn't even get in... but you mean that Palippi provides the key to get there..."

 "............ what do you have?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I don't know. That's what I care about, so I want to see... that's all. Sometimes I wonder. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you care?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Both Palippi and Yamidilee seem to have stepped into the ruins more or less after the rest of their deaths... what else they once sealed... I wonder what's going on"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do I do... I'm shaking the subject from myself, can I ask you in depth... I mean, that's how it is at the point I thought...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why you're so sloppy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I don't mind listening. Anyway, everything you see and hear is with you. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Trayna laughed at the way she told me to ask her anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, brother over there, did you catch anything?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsk..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was in the middle of a conversation, but this is on the boat. Naturally, there are others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old men of the giant sailors who lent me the fishing rod, who had stood on one leg and fished and stood out all morning, spoke to me with a grin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tran s l a te d b y jpmt l .co m "Oh, no... I didn't catch it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is only part of the training, and as an excuse like... I answered honestly because sometimes I didn't normally catch it with a bee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha ha, do it in the morning. Bowes is pathetic."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, are you new to fishing? All right, let me tell you something, old man?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, lend me the pole"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sailor old men who tame and pound my head. Honestly, I'm in the middle of training, so I want you to leave me alone... so I can feel free to take a bad attitude, and for now, I gaveled and lovingly laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nooo... stay out of my way when I say I'm still talking to the child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You thought Traina was interrupted in her training, too, with a somewhat murky and obstinate look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, even though this demon king is awesome, sometimes he looks like a child...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, is your brother alone? You're young enough to make a voyage on your own."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, well, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traveling? Where are you going?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Destinations heard in the course of the story. Well, it wouldn't be anything else to hide, so be honest...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Old Demon City... I thought I'd go to a place called Sisonotami."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old sailors react a little to my words. Well, Sisonotami's name itself is famous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, or was he suspicious?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On second thought, there's a kid like me in a land like the one that already perished over a decade ago...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There is now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And something seemed to bother me about my words, and the sailors' old men nodded at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Empire greats are visiting for a joint investigation with the Demon greats."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A few days ago, the great lady was advised to take care not to block this route."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, really...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know there was such an event. Well, I've been isolated from the outside world for the last three months, so I'm a little oblivious to the information, too...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that was a pretty big story, huh? I was escorted by the Imperial Fleet through the route this ship is taking."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, the fleet... Well, if the other guy is a Demon Greatman, you don't even know that some guy with the roots of the old days is going to attack you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was my father and mother skipping the job... fired? It's my fault...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And then the head of the Empire was a hero to everyone in the world!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes. Oh, my God, one of those seven brave men! Master Benlinarf, that's a big deal!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ...... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boop!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "None..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, I've heard too much about it, or I just accidentally erupted into a name I used to see a lot of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina frowned, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? You know your brother on the boulder?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is your brother born after the war? Do you even know about the Seven Brave Men?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When we were young, we were heroes."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You'd be surprised if you told these old men that the same goes for the parents who gave birth to me... or you wouldn't believe it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that archdeacon, my childhood father...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well... those seven brave men with escorts..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. I'm kind of glad to think about that Seven Brave Men going through the route they passed a few days ago, too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I said, the old men rubbing under their noses with their fingers gladly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn't know that was happening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don't hate that guy when I see him like His Majesty the Emperor for nothing, not as sturdy as Rival's father, always like Nico's sweet brother, but I've seen him lately at all - from... or if I run into him, isn't it a bad idea?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, well, that happened a few days ago. In the meantime, no problem. You?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well. I mean, nobody's going to attack you, and I don't want any trouble. I don't care how many lives you have."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, right"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ouch. Somehow not only the Great Demon Master, but the Great Demon who was escorted in the first place..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me laughing bitterly and the old man snorting at it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But following from the mouth of such an old man...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whatever... it's the" Toddler Girl Fighting General "of the Six Heights ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised enough to erupt again too, but it would be more to Traina...... no...... eh? Wait a minute...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a relaxing, slow journey for two, wasn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do I have a bad feeling about this before we land?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Please, I'm already full...... don't let anything extra happen to me for a while!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... Traina..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I'm already with you...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" You want to stop going?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a joke, and half-seriously we said so with a bitter smile.
