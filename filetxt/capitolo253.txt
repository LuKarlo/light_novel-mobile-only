 One of the six champions that we are working with Uncle Ben on a joint investigation into a site that is also our destination.

 Me and Trayna hesitated just because it was easy to imagine the development, which would always not be calm if we met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And think again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old magic city of Sisonotami, this time a destination.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina is concerned about the presence of an ancient ruin said to sleep in its basement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now the new government of the demon kingdom and imperial officials are investigating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then maybe you can't get in while they're investigating?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hmmm... child... speaking of example master key, but Parippi said he would contact you about how to receive it, but not yet. From here on in Demon Crystal......'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I don't want to hear from you... somehow... but it's about him, so when you hear from me, they might think you trust something, and I don't like it..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, um... certainly given the current situation... I don't even need to rush it so fast...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, although Traina cares about the ruins, it's nothing. It's not in a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Especially if the deepest part of the ruins doesn't have a master key, they won't be able to investigate the depths of the ruins either... whatever..."

 "Oh, it's better after I get out of the way..."

 "Uhm... you don't have to take risks on unnecessary errands."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it's better to zickle slowly and non-billy after they get home and everything settles down than to force them to go and take the risk of running into them?

 "Hey, brother! Bring me one box with that bait over there! And the net!

 Now I've come to the conclusion that I don't have to rush off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why we decided to stay in the port town where we arrived for a little while.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, don't carry that to the top of the rampage! It's not for sale, so carry it carefully one box at a time! Don't drop it!

 An exotic land reached. The other continents east from the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the Dipercha Empire we arrived in a few days aboard a ship: the 'Abosoa continent'.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A large continent developed from a different cultural formation from the Empire, such as the Kingdom of Japone, which is also the home of Sinob. It can be the first time I land too. Tr a n s la te d by jpm tl.co ｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the ship arrived in the busy and huge fishing port, the 'port town of Genkan'.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Countless fishing boats, large and small, dock, and if they go up to land, there is a huge fish market in front of them, and everyone is in a hurry to move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's nothing like the peaceful harbour town I left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I didn't have a lot of money, either, to live on it, or even to spend until the Imperial and Demonic Realm Inquiry returns...

 'Hey, the captain's calling over there. He wants you to help him pack. "

 "Ooh."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the mouth of the old sailors, I was allowed to work at the fishing port.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once he took off the uniform of the academy he had been wearing, he wrapped it around his head by hand and was running around the fishing port with the labor of loading and unloading with strength.

 "Phew... I always ate fish without thinking about it, but heck - it's tough. If I hadn't done the muscle tread with the cackletail, I'd be pretty tired."

 "Well, a fisherman is a heavy labourer"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You sure are all muscular. And so did the old fishermen at Cacletail."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Oh. And fishermen are early in the morning. Mentally and physically toughness is required'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides, even though all I do is chore, there's money I can get you to work for a day... and tease me with the pennies I was getting at home..."

 'You, never speak of that in public. You're gonna make the vibe worse.'

 "'Cause that first inn I saw was worn out, the bed was stiff, and the room would have crisps and black bugs...' cause the church in Cacletail was always pretty compared to that ~..."

 "Ma'am. I forgot I couldn't register a hunter in the city of Hon Evo because I didn't have an ID..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, the old men at the fishing port also said, "Are you okay with a kid like this? It felt like," but now that I've been trained by Trayna, I couldn't do it without a particular problem if it was just a simple task.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I was dissatisfied, it meant that the price I could get for working all day and only doing chores was not that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm just saying I'm dissatisfied...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh, bro! Come on, now!

 "Ah..."

 Old man giving me a dirty, sticky bag with rough, gotten hands on labor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the price of a day's labor, and the moment I received it, the amount itself shouldn't be a big deal, but I felt a shitty weight on that bag, and at the same time I felt kind of filled my mind.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, what happened to Meshi?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? No, I thought I'd go to the restaurant later..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then come with us! Give it to me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's okay!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gahahahahaha, you've worked so well for the last two days! I worried about what kind of hero he was because I heard he was an Empire mon, but I liked it! You're welcome to work tomorrow!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I get my head shaken with dirty hands. Yet I didn't feel bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn... hehe..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, because I was new to working on my own and making money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hey, you're not wasting it, are you? I will need money for my upcoming journey. Savings are better.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, wow. The money I got from Acer three months ago for the battle against Sinob has disappeared with the cost of the ship that comes this far..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Work yourself to get money. Live with the money you earn yourself. This kind of thing, I felt like 'I'm a little grown up' and I felt kind of good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Besides, if you think about it, it's also a problem that you've always been a handful to travel. You should also buy essential' items' for your journey here at the tool store '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, you sure do. That's what I had to do with Hon Evo and Canty Dan!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'When you're done eating with the fishermen, we're going to the tool shop in this city. Let's see what we got, and we'll see what's left.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehe, I'm not an adventurer or a hunter... getting ready for the trip. That sounds interesting, too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while I was concerned about my holdings, I was also kind of excited to get everything I needed from now on, with the money I earned myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until I ran away from home, I had no trouble with the money because I had decided to get a penny every month. I could usually buy what I wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I survived only a little in the mountains even after I ran away from home, but I met Mr. Aka and he gave me a warm meal and a bed for free.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From there I went wild during the next trip to the city, but Sinob, who was tracking me from behind when it came to eating, regularly gave me rice balls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that, he brawled in Hon Evo and was grabbed by Yamidilee as he was, and in Cacletail, he came out every day in church morning, noon and evening and without a three-meal mesh doing anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I've never seen anything like this before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... That's right... I mean...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Something's happening... but I think the journey has begun."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew, that's really it now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, our journey is coming!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a refreshing mood...
