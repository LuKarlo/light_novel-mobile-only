 'No, until a decade or so ago, that was Noja's preference in her thirties as a human being... a successful, especially mustache and dandy man... she said she preferred to wear a collar like that, naked it completely, and teach it until she broke her heart and gasped in an outrageous way, but she changed her sexuality because of Hiiro or because she liked it enough to covet fifteen or so young people swaying in the narrow between immature boys and youth... well, her preference wouldn't change to be Hiiro - but sexuality - and that's what Hiiro's son, boss, to that perverted Lolivado's fate?'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, Trayna wouldn't feel very good about being complained about her former men either.

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hi-ha, what is it?" Well, I might be convinced that Hiiro is the cause of everything - but it's emotional to hear it from my real son's mouth as a former hexagon - or... did he even brainwash himself like that to "someone" who had a bad influence on you? Hi-ha. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ho!? Oh, my God, you parippi! Hey, kid! You tell this fool right now! Even if the rest helps children grow up, it never means brainwashing or anything! The rebellion of the child was originally prepared due to puberty distortion, and the rest and the child are bound by deep trust!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna on parippi's little provocative words gaggles around me, but parippi knows the answer, but if you say that to this guy, you'll admit it all... so you can't say it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, there's nothing wrong with being tied to Trayna in a deep relationship of trust, but saying that from the front to Parippi is... kinda hazy... this guy will definitely piss you off...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hihaha, well, it's about those two dispersing and then investigating the ruins so I don't see Noja properly about that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, wow. But... Something tells me that a lot of those six championships are going to suck, but even though the war is over, are you okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ahhh, that's okay. If you're not in kinky mode, Noja's a decent general. Even if the Seven Braves were the enemy, Hiiro, because if Maam wasn't involved, he'd be decent. Back in the day, I heard rumors that Espi the Seven Braves and I were friends of the Dog Monkeys, but now we're friends. Well, I don't even know where Espi himself is.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I figured I wouldn't go to the ruins when I couldn't and that nojah or something was investigating, or I shouldn't.
