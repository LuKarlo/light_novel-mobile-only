 Only in the Imperial Capital, but with me and Fiancei, Rival and Four Foos, the adventure.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a whole thing, equipped with fallen leaves with medicinal herbs and potions of water in a water bottle, like using mud dumplings made in the sand instead of rice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I've never bought anything like that as equipment to do adventures, although I know it as a trick or as an item to use as part of an Academy class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little thrilled that I was getting ready for the adventure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Finally, here we are, adventurers and hunters... tool shops!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although it is a thriving genkan in the fishing port, naturally there are many immigrants and adventurers from outside the country, and the city also has a proper guild to register hunters and a tool shop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Plus, it's just a big city with a large population, and tool stores seem to have all sorts of groceries, which are pretty big. T r ansl a t e d by Jp mtl .coｍ

 "Leader. I bought 20 potions, 5 mana waters for magic restoration, and food too"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, the rest is weapons. In the meantime, I'd like to buy a one-ranked sword."

 "Hey, leader. I want a new wand, too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is still full of young people who are new to adventurers, from those who look like veterans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've only ever been involved with fishermen, innkeepers and rice shoppers, so I could finally see other people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the conversation I hear is exactly the sole of the adventurers, and I'm getting extra excited.

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not that much, but it's not even the pennies I got until I ran away from home or the money I earned from Traina's Acer of War.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh... the weapon is so... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You walked into the store, and the first thing you saw was a weapons corner.

 Shapes Starting with various swords, spears, axes, bows and arrows...... but......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... something... doesn't seem like much of a deal"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Weapons are exciting just to watch, and I was excited to head to the weapons corner too, but when I looked closely, I also found that they didn't look that good iron, nor were they trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If there's any array...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's usually a lot of better stuff in my arsenal..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a lot more variety of weapons in the mansion that my father and mother collected, and there were a lot of things I could tell were powerful weapons just by looking at them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared to that, it feels like I saw it. Such a big thing...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 'Naturally. In the first place, Excalibur broke the rest in battle hundreds of years ago, and Gungnir is Solja the Seven Brave...... the father of the princess of that empire has it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ...... Hmm? Something awesome was said and I watched Traina twice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Is it a real weapon?! Speaking of which, I think this guy said something sassy about breaking the legendary knife/kotetsu in Kantidan...

 'Well, it doesn't matter about weapons. Your style of combat does not require weapons in the first place. The battle against Paris during this time was just special.'

 "Well, yeah... I don't know, romantic..."

 'Rather than a weapon to you... Hmm... oh, that one!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna glanced over at the weapons corner, staring at one place and sparkling her eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Isn't there something good right! I miss it...... kid, keep it there' multi-tool knife '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What an exciting knife Trayna has been recommending to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I followed that gaze... there wasn't even that many people there, and there was one box in there, and I looked inside and there was a ton of little patterned stuff in there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unpopular and sold? Something like nobody's buying it?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, I'm out... tiny..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the folding type, I tried to get the blade out, which is much smaller than the kind of knife the hunters use as a weapon...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Much smaller than the Knai that Sinob had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fighting a monster or something like this can only do a little damage, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I can only imagine the sight of a knife snapping if I stab Mr. Macho in his abs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Trayna's grin remains the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh. You don't understand. It's not for combat, it's equipped with a variety of features to use in outdoor life. '

 "... what?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Try pulling something other than a knife."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Other... that? Yasled or even a spoon or a fork...... it even has scissors!? Wow, this is so convenient!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it was a knife, that wasn't the only feature that was folded.

 Are you the inventor? But as much as you can look doya. Sure this is handy.

 It's not heavy at all, it goes into your pocket, and then it's used for a variety of purposes.

 Instead, surely this isn't a necessity?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And did Traina question that a little too...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But why so much extra? I don't think it's strange to sell it all... and it also says it's a big deal!

 Yeah, I thought so, too.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this is such a handy thing, you wouldn't damage it at all with a swordsman, a spear man, a wizard, if you're going to venture into whatever your job title is.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, there's a young adventurer."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, cute. Ugh, am I an apprentice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? That knife... ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From behind me like that, people who seem to be some sort of adventurer party spoke to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know how many young guys there are, but maybe it's unusual for them to be as young as me in 15.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then they laughed bitterly when they saw the knife I had in my hand...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You don't know because you're young, but you don't really have that knife... you don't have a good image, do you? Well, I don't have the one you're using or the one you're not."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's what the Demon Kings used to use... you know... from people who know a lot of the old days... you have an image? Well, maybe the younger generations who don't know war will use it without knowing it from now on, haven't they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that look and the words until then, both me and Trayna understood everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, it doesn't feel good to use the same thing that the Demon Kings used.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I wasn't even born at the time, I'd still be the ones who were born at the time, let alone the veterans who would have fought in the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From those people, even though the war is over, what the Demon King's Army was using... ahhh, that sort of thing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn the adventurers and hunters whose freedom is said to be synonymous with weird things... I'm sorry"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kept what I thought in my mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I buy it because I don't care"
</div>

 Such a handy and cheap versatile item...... I don't want to have to worry about the eyes around me and not possess them.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, of course I don't know how these guys feel. But I don't.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some of them would have had their families killed by the Demon King's Army who had this, or had unfortunate eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I don't even know how they feel about "I don't want to use it" or "it may not seem good from around".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from me, it's such a small thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, not now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 'Uhm... Uhm, now you're on mobile food and herbs!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like Traina was smiling happily when she saw something about me... well, don't touch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I decided, and I put my foot in the next corner.
