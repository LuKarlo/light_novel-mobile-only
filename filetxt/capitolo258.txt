 I thought, "No one buys it because I don't have a good image, it sells cheap."

 At that time, Trayna shifted her gaze to one corner. That's the grocery corner.

 I should have bought what I should have already bought, but what else? Besides, that's a shelf we haven't seen.

 I have no idea what is on the boulder or the color of the spices in the bottle, but Trayna is making her eyes shine.

 At that time, a man stood in front of us looking back at the spice corner.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're not buying it?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A young man with a neat face, wearing an apron.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he looks down at me jiggly with a faceless, doll-like eye that doesn't feel emotional ups and downs.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's just, or you don't have enough money..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden he showed up, stuffed me up, and told me I didn't know what it meant to bump... Sinob had suddenly stuffed the distance like this when he first fell in love with me and talked about all sorts of things, but, well, that meant he fell in love with me, and it's something I could forgive because he's beautiful... when he did that to an older man... honestly, it's disgusting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Trayna also looks at this man with sharp eyes.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like the manager of this store from what we talked about.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm just standing there, I know. This guy's pretty strong, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least I can see that this manager is much stronger than any of the adventurers and hunters in this store.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, it's as cold as ever ~," Store Manager Slaya "is ~"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But it's cool and strong, so that's a nice attitude too..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Trayna reacted to the words the people around her said with laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Slaya? Its name…… only… '
