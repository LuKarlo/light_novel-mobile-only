 "Well, brother there. You were about to pick a spice. You're gonna use this to cook, right? I know."

 "Ha ha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you don't have to worry about money... what do you choose?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A store manager who suddenly appeared, didn't seem to be the only one, and seems to be quite famous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He sticks out his faceless face like he's trying me out and asks me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like I don't know the truth and I honestly don't want to get involved...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Spices are a lot more powerful in the hunter business… at least more than potions. That's what I think. But the world today doesn't even try to understand if no one knows it"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ran s l a t e d b y Jpｍtl .coｍ "Ha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So is this knife, isn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, the manager took something out of his own trouser pocket.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a magical survival knife, a little old for use.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This one... the user..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded like Traina was impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tra n s l a te d by Ｊpm tl .c o ｍ Yes, the man in front of him uses a magical survival knife that many hunters said was "badly imagined" and that was cheap but didn't try to buy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Plus...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is nutritious, isn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now from the other pocket, he took out a bag of calorie friends, peeled them off and straightened them out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. So this is what you're saying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Very useful knife or portable food if you buy it. This man sells it as a product because he knows it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the hunters don't buy it because they know it was used by Demon King soldiers once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that, you said you were interested in me trying to buy without even worrying about that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wouldn't have been interested either if Trayna hadn't told me...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I admit it. You don't know me, but you do. That's why I want to know. Which one would you choose with spice? Buy what? I want to know. I want to know. I want to know more about you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you happy I buy it, this guy is even more like excited to pack the distance...... no, no, scary scary close.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what the hell is this guy? Trayna?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hey, Traina. You felt like you knew about this guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... I've only heard the name... that was more than a decade ago when the rest was alive" Trans l a t e d b y jp m t l .ｃ oｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dozen years ago. Well, that's right... but wait a minute. How old is this guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're not that old, are you? I definitely don't have thirty or anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Late twenties? No, first half? I believe you when they say teenager...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Once there was a boy under the age of ten who gave his name as a hunter dedicated to monsters and bounty necks..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Hunter..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Looks like the Coalition was scouting to draw that boy to their side, but the boy never tried to join the Coalition and was committed to being a hunter... now he was hunting for a few necks of the Commander of the Demon Army class too... and Gouda was boggling'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looks at the manager jiggly as Traina arms herself to remember the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the way things are going, then this guy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Then... you did hear the boy report that he was captured alive without rivalry even challenging Noja to fight...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? What's Noja, a six-human?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Uhm. It's just that right after that... Espi the Seven Brave engaged Nojah, and eventually the captives ran away... and then I don't know the rest. Back then, Hakuki was engaged with the Hiiros, and the war report will give priority to you...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see... you seem to have a complicated past of sorts, but for now, he said he was an amazing hunter enough to get into Trayna's ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And such a man now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, what's going on? You don't even know me, and then you're choosing the right 'I know' thing, what would you choose if you could get this wide variety of spices?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T r ans l a t e d by ｊpｍtl .c o m He's showing an interest in me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess he was quite a celebrity as a hunter, not so much as a store manager, because of this look around him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know myself as such a celebrity. Now, what I think is "whoa" for this guy is the tool he's trying to pick out and buy properly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So he's showing interest in me and talking to me... is that what you're saying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... there's no money."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes. I don't have any money to choose from.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the manager's eyebrows moved picturesque and unpleasant at my words like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up. Wouldn't you disappoint me for some boring reason that I don't have any money?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I don't care what you say..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... I don't know what else to do..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I talk about money, the manager exhales...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then if you choose spices that make me roar... I'll give you the price for spices for free"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'd really like to give you other products for free... but you don't know me. What did I tell you, Hidoi? That's about enough for you, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr a n s lat ed by Jpmt l.co m Is this guy pretty concerned that he's not known for his faceless flirting?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no more roaring choices than that. Free?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is a challenge from me, isn't it? Come on, what do we do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trying me. In the words of such a store manager, Trayna...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded quietly. And this one is very motivated. And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Coriander, Cumin, Turmeric, Galam Masala! Others untara cantara - '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, come on... Ahhh, Koli-An, Kumi, Tame Riku..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah. And then?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With Trayna placing one hand on her hips, she sticks her fingers out in front of her bisci, pointing one after the other to the hundred + bottles of spices displayed in front of her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I whisper my name so that I can learn from it, and the manager snorts in his arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "- - And Kurobu, it takes, that's it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will raise more than ten spices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The manager nodded when I heard the whole thing. But you're not convinced...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... unfortunately... can't that be all?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nano!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't...? Trayna is also surprised by the boulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell happened?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can do it with that combination... traditional dishes handed down to this continent... Karrie... I've tried it many times, but it wasn't enough"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what? Currie?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, it is also the strongest healthy food in the world I recognize and the strongest outdoor mesh in hunters and adventurers...... Currie. I'm sure you were going to make that too... not that combination..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered what the reason was, but what exactly was Currie... or Currie that Trayna was talking about earlier, was the dish that would pass on to this continent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I eat quite a bit of curry, too. I was hoping you could make me roar like that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought this guy had taken an interest in people on his own, and he sighed like he was disappointed on his own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not sure about Callie, but I'm usually annoyed!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Trayna! I don't know, they say!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Huh... you mean... I see... this... Aoyagi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, Trayna had a terribly scary smile just full of the majesty of the Demon King when she whined in her heart that Trayna's choice was being ridiculed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kid, it's coffee."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'The rest was always in the hidden flavor... I had made demon world coffee... well, making coffee is a betta in itself, a classic though... but the rest was focused on that type. What the rest of us preferred to use for Currie was coffee from the Demon Realm...... HELLS COFFEE!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what a noisy hidden flavor it is, but I think the name is too insistent...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, is there a Hers coffee from the Demon Realm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina was confident, so I asked her anyway, and the store manager looked hazy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... no... I don't handle that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Shit... then, on the ground... right, the coffee from the Empire was close... not like the royal ones, it was manufactured in the small countryside, but that fits best'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh... so what's from the Empire for now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I don't think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the manager puts his hand on his chin...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... well... I wasn't into the coffee itself either... it's from the Empire..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow the manager is once again exhaling deeply... but couldn't he?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay. Let's get it back."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tell me more about the manufacturer when accounting for that tool"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It was my downfall that I didn't have the product I wanted. I'll give you free spice money."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The store manager suddenly changed the color of his eyes. Was that good?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you want it back? How motivated are you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, is the spice free? Did it turn out good?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It'll take a few days... but you're still in this city, aren't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, for once... I'm here..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, then, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For once, I have a few days before I get my stuff from Paris, but... some weird guy caught my eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
