<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was absent from the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is due to the effect of stabbing acupuncture into my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apart from the aches in my muscles, my joints were also wrecked with pain, my body temperature was high and my head was fuzzy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth… Why is this… And, such a high fever…… Oh, my Little man”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Consciousness is hazy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I am a little glad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not really a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because that Sadiz will take care of me through it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Over and over she cools a hand towel and places it on my head, and every time it’s exchanged, I feel her hand chilled from the ice water, with plenty of care…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, why did you pierce yourself with acupuncture… Not to mention, it was all over your body. Isn’t it really self-harm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ch-Chi, Gah. J-Just trying some oriental needle treatment to relieve fatigue…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t it pointless if it affects your health? Now, how worried do you think I was about you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not sure…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Master and Lady won’t be back, but today I will not leave Little Man’s side, even for a little bit, so please take care of yourself…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, I couldn’t say that the acupuncture had forcibly opened my magic hole, so I told Sadiz that I was dabbling in acupuncture to relieve my body’s fatigue after training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for Sadiz, regardless of how much I studied acupuncture, she seemed to be hurt as a personal maid because of my illness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, it’s heartbreaking to have made Sadiz worry, but I was happy to see her pampering mode for the first time in a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I was not able to fully enjoy the bliss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu, Ugh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… Your arms and legs seem to be aching… will this also require acupuncture?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-Well, that’s how it is… Urgh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just the fever and a headache. Severe pain keeps running all over my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only the points that were pierced with acupuncture had abnormally high heat and felt as painful as a cut from a sharp blade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Every time I was in shock due to pain, I lost consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, cast 【Vier】 as you lose consciousness.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In my fading consciousness, Tre’ainar’s voice echoed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis training in a dream, child.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nooo!? Damnit, I fainted! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if I lose consciousness, Tre’ainar is waiting in my dreams with arms folded and a full-faced smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「However, tis pathetic to pass out. We only hit two magic holes.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I-I’ve lost face…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But tis only on the first day that you fall ill so far. From now on, only the pain will accompany the opening process. That is how the body is rebuilt.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s just pain…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Even so, I was the right to have you learn 【Vier】. Even if you are immobile and bedridden, I can train you.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「If I’m awake… to Sadiz.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s hell when I sleep. Even if I wake up, hell and only a little healing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I could choose from either, I’d pick being awake, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Do not grieve. Anyway, I want you to learn 【Great Demon Super Evolution • Breakthrough】 as soon as possible. Once this is achieved, we will spend what remains of these two months on ladder training and sparring.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When it comes to Tre’ainar, any time I go to sleep he’ll be there, smiling at the fact that we get to to train to his heart’s content. It was a little frightening to me, but this is also for the promise of the boobs in two months!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, at any rate, your body is now being modified. If you keep doing this, you will never lose to those of your age if you only have one chance to release magic. But…… tis not enough win. Do you know why?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A one-shot destructive magical power obtained in exchange for severe pain and hellish suffering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, of course, the reason why it’s not enough to win…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. Even if I can open my magic holes and release a lot of magic… My magic capacity itself is small, so if I unleash a strong spell, that’ll be the end of it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That is right. And, as I said when you were awake, the magic capacity in the body is a kind of talent. This will not increase immediately. Then what do we do? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can win if you just hit each other’s magic once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it can’t be done in a fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if the magic misses? Even more so, the game is a tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once your capacity reaches zero, you won’t be able to fight anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So… Instead of ‘releasing’ the magic of the body, it’s about ‘keeping it around’ of the body.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Like this!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a red light covered Tre’ainar’s body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the technique I was shown in my first dream.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I fasten the magic around the body. Tis a technique that uses everything only to increase physical abilities.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Around me… Fasten?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Strengthening the body, improving self-healing power… In your case, the previous figures…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In this case, if you use a powerful spell…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It will be as such.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, that’s great.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, once you hit it, it’s over. That’s why it’s a one-shot game.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But if you fasten it in the body instead of releasing it… You can reduce the risk of losing magic in an instant.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Is that right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s right. Breakthroughs always drain magical power. However, as long as you do not use great techniques like spiral breaks, you can maintain a much better power over ordinary people for a reasonable amount of time. For example…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「To be precise, tis a little different, but you can think of it as reducing your magic power by 1 per second.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah… I see.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「However, in order to activate the Breakthrough once, you must have a certain amount of open magic holes in the whole body … so you are now building that body.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A vague explanation. Of course, if you defend or attack in a Breakthrough state, your magic will decrease much faster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So in Tre’ainar’s calculation, you can fight in a Breakthrough state for up to 100 seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「For the time being, tis better to learn from here on with your body rather than reason. In that respect, the image training within 【Vier】 is very efficient. I can demonstrate it, and you can acquire more aptitude while fighting.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from here on out, it’s no longer logical.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rest is single-mindedly……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Come on, child! Tis beneficial to learn by heart the numerous ways to die!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, w-wait! Oh, Aaaaaaah!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This can be acquired in training! There is no secondary effect such as fire or lightning, but no chanting is required. Tis a perfect technique for you who will be proficient at martial arts.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dream sparring single-mindedly with the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「This is the 【Great Demon Super Evolution • Breakthrough】 that was developed by me.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, dreams can’t really kill, can they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And………… for the time being, I died.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buhah! …… Haa, ha… That?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Su~…… Su~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I woke up to my bed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And beside the bed, Sadiz was sitting in a chair and fast asleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… woke up from the dream…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Aaah. We had plenty of training this instance. Forgoing the academy might have been for the best, after all.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King is there whether I’m asleep or awake. Yeah, that’s really what you’d call a shared destiny.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… Li… tle ma…… Su~ su~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sleep talk from Sadiz. And it’s about me. Something about this makes me happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hehe… Thank you. Sadiz”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why do you not show more gratitude towards my efforts?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, do not ignore me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I look at Sadiz sleeping, I feel excited, but I also feel guilt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess she’s pretty tired.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess I was nursed all day long without regaining consciousness… So… seeing Sadiz in front of me at the pillow, sitting in a chair, in a short skirt and very little guard at my feet, I didn’t look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y-Yeah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Gee…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ka-kun”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 White lace! Very fine! The milk is very rich and nutritious. Hello!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, what are you looking at, ignoring me?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is unavoidable. It’s force majeure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now I didn’t look into it. Because I can’t move out of bed, what I saw was an accident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even if I look at it a little more…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’, Earth…No… don’t…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oooooh! The legs are wide open!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She started talking in her sleep a little while ago, her legs were gradually opening, and now I’ve seen a piece of underwear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s not a big deal, so having a view of the garden shouldn’t be a big deal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, Little man…… No more…… ♪I’m going to tell you something♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I looked up at Sadiz’s words, her legs gradually opening wider.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nofofufufu- ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, with a smile as sharp as a crescent moon in her mouth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You must remember, Little man. The sleeping girl that calls the man’s name usually only pretends to be asleep♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a woman’s strategy, isn’t it? Sorry to destroy the dream of a virgin boy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m done. Was she up from the beginning?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, maybe she was sleeping, but she woke up about the same time as me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s sad, though. The boy is also 15. In the world, there may be people of the same age that will have sexual experience soon, such as dating and their first. Yet, you have a rough nose simply from the maid’s panties, Fufufufu ~, such a small person ~, Little man~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Urgh, Guh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz attacks me with a nasty grinning smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, Hazy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was down, she was so nice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine… Little man”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s all there is to it… The knockers are the prize, but… If it’s about panties to heal your fatigue, it’s still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Heh!? What!? What? Now, From Sadiz’s spiteful face, to that of a lady with a little shyness? What? What is healing panties!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This time, the fact that Little man fell is the disgrace of a lifetime as a maid”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no! It’s acupuncture treatment or training muscle pain…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, I beg your pardon! If my panties heal Little man even a little…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz isn’t bad at all, but is she hurt? I’m sorry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are you talking about, you’re not bad for anything. But, if I want it, will you show me? More, can I see more of Sadiz’s panties!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If Little man says he wants it, ‘speak out’… I will obey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t do it. Give such an order.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s kind of like a sensual novel in which a rich scum plays with a maid, and it’s a crazy, exciting… But I need healing, and probably Sadiz wants to show them too. Surely, it’s a contest of panties.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s why I can’t help it, so I’m going to see it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz. Show me Sadiz’s panties!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I’m home now! What’s Earth’s condition?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, I’m here! Just wait, your mom will heal you soon. Hea…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the door of my room was briskly thrown open, and there were my father and mother whose expressions changed to a blood rage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Sa… Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nofufu- , Little man. Are you still hot? You have to be aware of the signs that your parents have returned.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… th-they shouldn’t be home. “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ooh? Without your parents, you would have given such an order. That’s the kind of guy you are Little man- ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I was beaten…… From the face of the sexy woman until a while ago, to that devilish smile again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My oh my…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar is an admirer as well, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”This Stupid Soooooooon!!!! “”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and mother. I was beat up by two heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you for your help.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for your feedback.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reviews and evaluations are also very motivating, and it has become a body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw it today, it was 26000.

 For the time being, I will do my best aiming at 30000.

 Well, it was pointed out from various people in the previous impression,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were a lot of topics ’drop Magic Hole’, and I thought, “After all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is also a “magic hole” in the proposal, in fact, there is a time when I also thought for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there’s a reason why I didn’t choose it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, most of you may have noticed that the Chinese characters “hole” and “milk” are very similar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if there is a person who misunderstands “Magic Hole” and reads “Magic Milk” in this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since the reward of the earth is sole, I will read without discomfort?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result of worrying about the danger, I chose “Magic Hole”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the hole is attached, you know, there is also a hole digging, i thought it would be good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, the previous story breaks the magic hole in the forbidden master’s pupil……?? The forbidden master and the devil’s……??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This story will continue to be a healthy story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s very hot, but please take care of yourself and your mind and body.
