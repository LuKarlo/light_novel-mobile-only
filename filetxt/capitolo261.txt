<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The main harbour where the fishermen's fishing boats fill the sea and where the vessels come and go intensely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From there, a little uneven, a small boat headed this way on the shore of the forest facing the sea where I stand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Umm."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought it was being transported on a large ship because it was a smuggling ship..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I guess I did until I was on my way. Normally, however, large ships are allowed to dock in the port, or loads are checked during unloading. He must have reloaded a small ship on the way in the ocean to hide and carry cosoli and illegal things'.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, are you doing that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhm." Say, "Take the Se." It's an orthodox hand that was used during the smuggling of more illegal drugs and weapons. ' Tr a n sl a t e d b y Jp m t l .ｃ o m
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are a few people on the boat who will stare at us. I can't see it because I weave my whole body with cloak-like robes and my face is also deeply hooded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 About two large crates as loads of ships.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... bump bump bump bump..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then one of the robe figures on the boat is pointing something at us with his palm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's a magic crystal. I groaned with bumps toward this one, and then from the Demon Crystal...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tra ns lat e d by Ｊpm t l .c o ｍ "Hihaha, let it go ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard that unpleasant, extreme voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the person who had the demon crystal held the cloth bag at his feet and threw it at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Huh, looks like you let Parippi verify your identity. That's the package. Take it.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, ooh, ooh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I caught the bag thrown. Then, that's all the tension he threw, and he let the ship change direction without telling me a word or anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, they're gone, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'They're just hauliers. I was just hired for money. I don't want to get involved, so instead of revealing my identity, I don't know anything about the shipment, and I'm worried about not asking about the recipient or anything'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh... Really... you follow the rules of the outlaws..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, you're thinking a lot about the guys who do bad things. If you want to use your head to think about that, you can seriously work... and I can't help it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, in a way, I've been stepping into 'this side' since today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops, this is it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put my hand inside the cloth bag I received and it feels square inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I take it out, a box packaged in ribbon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ransl a ted b y Ｊpｍt l .c o ｍ Untie the ribbon and look inside...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh... Inside... First, there's a piece of paper..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhm... stamped... undoubtedly, issued in formal procedure... ID for 'fictional person'"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This... hey... I don't want to use it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Don't say luxury. Without it, you wouldn't even be able to make money for your journey. So, there's something else...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh.... another one...... something like a small 'card'......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A small, palm-sized card that was in the box, besides a forged ID.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feeling, elasticity, etc. touched is something I have never seen before, and the surface of the card is engraved with a pattern I have never seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is this? What does it say...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... MASTER KEY..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Huh... I didn't know he really had it... where the hell did he get it...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Leaked from Traina's mouth, the word "master key". I mean, is this the key? So this card is the key?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don't seem to be mistaken from how Trayna is grinning at her mouth with a little excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So this is what Trayna's been chasing all her life?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what do we do? I knew it..." T r an s lat e d b y jpm t l.ｃoｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No... good'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna was suggesting that I go slow with my workouts, but I saw this master key and tried to ask just in case I still wanted to go fast, but Trayna shook her head to the side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's nothing like taking a little longer now. Instead, I run into hasty and troublesome people and find it more difficult to stay away from the purpose. Let's go slow. '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... if that's what you say, fine"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, I got this from Parippi. Hold on tight, and now my growth is no different to the behavioral guideline of first, and I snorted, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yaho, Leader, I gave you a gift?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that son of a bitch without reading the air again there... no, I guess I'm not wrong in the sense of that confirmation because I got the deal bumps...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I got it"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hihaha, that was good ~. Ahhh, I look happy to see that gift too, I would have liked to see the face of" Someone "~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... temee..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It means I wanted to see Traina's delightful face. Trayna is a little musty, too. She seems to be peeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... let me use more than I got... where did you get this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, he cut the story out of me so he wouldn't take the pace to talk to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The content is a question that Trayna was whining about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ra n sla te d b y jp m tl.ｃ oｍ Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh no? Somebody told me to ask because I care ~? You're not supposed to care ~?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Colour, mu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma, but there's no big reason, is there? That's seriously a coincidence... because I picked it up '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I picked it up. No, this is serious. No real lies, hundred par. Seriously, I picked it up by accident."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, a card that seems to be made of something special like this...... did you stumble upon something that Trayna has been craving all her life? That's why there's such a thing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'This one... you don't seem to be lying...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, I guess there's something else going on, but I guess it's true that' I got it by accident '... I don't even know under what circumstances I got it'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, Traina seems to have believed the words of Paris. Well, I've seen about Paris for years, and that's what Trayna says, so you're sure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hihaha, well, because of that, have fun. It seems so interesting in the deepest part of the site. However…… '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Except? What the hell."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Some of the deepest roads are branching out again... because some of them are too old for buildings, or some idiot did it artificially... and some of the roads are devastated to get through anyway... and I don't know what the route is, so just know that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought I could pave the way too, but it's gonna take a lot of work, and I'm good at breaking it, but I'm not good at fixing it, and I didn't want to be forced to blow the rubble or anything and the whole ruin crumbled, so you left me alone."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that being said, how confusing and adding to the possibility that something I don't even know yet in Paris is asleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hihaha, well, if you find some way to get through it, with someone else's wisdom, you can tell me sometime. So, that's it, Bose! Have fun.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the end of the day, the communication from Paris was interrupted by just saying that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once again, in the quiet woods, after a lot of silence, Traina...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, I see... Parippi also said there was a route where he threw a spoon and turned his heel back..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'To tell the truth, child. I was very interested in what was at the deepest end of the ruins... but if it seemed that Parippi and others had already reached there to solve the mystery... I was in a slightly subtle mood as well. Because it would mean that the rest of us have fallen behind Paris. But......'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Traina's cheeks are loose again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than ever, he's apparently excited about his upcoming adventure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So you're saying we're the first?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Uhm. Except for the Far Ancient... Don't Be'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that's the case, I'm getting excited too. Besides, the radar I'm about to master is that kind of ruin that helps with dungeon attacks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'All right, kid. When we're done for dinner, we'll train fast!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bet on Ninja!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though I'm not in a hurry, I kind of wanted to go fast, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We need to master the Magical Radar and the...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh, I wanted to."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You were here. I looked for it. Brother?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man came to us in the back of the woods out of the city... in his hands...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was lucky. A pedestrian from the city has an example coffee... here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, the man offered me the bottle of coffee he had in his hand...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, let's make a curry. Brother."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Oh, no, no, eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as a matter of course, suggest that you make it for me with Currie...... no, no, no?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man is the manager of the tool shop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His first name is Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This one... what..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're not gonna show up all of a sudden, and then you're gonna bring the coffee I've spoken of in the meantime, and then you're gonna make the curry with me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is this all about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that's not all...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I followed you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Ha!? Now what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You make my sister cry, you suck brother."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither me nor Trayna understand the situation so badly, even more the voice of a third party.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, there is a young woman floating with a puppet who has never even looked over the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who the hell is that? No, seriously, who?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? That ~? That? Something... is there a man in the way who can't read the air?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... this is not a good time... to get in my way... you annoying bitch"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, the woman, I thought she looked at me for a moment and nicked, she immediately looked at Slaya, who was next to me, and hit some stabbing words, and Slaya hit the mysterious woman again with her expressionless and grumpy words...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trayna's surprised, too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
