 People floating around? And the strange thing is, it doesn't feel like magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't feel anything at this time, being sensitive to the magic in the atmosphere and the magic used by the opponent due to his breathing skills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if the winged man were floating in the sky, the woman is floating puffy.
</div>

 "Hey, what's this about? Slaya. I wonder why you are here? What's your job?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is there something wrong with that too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm. Shit, that's good. I'm not after you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You seem to know Slaya. Either way, this woman is not the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Traina knew about this guy, too. Yes, but... Tra n sla t ed by Jpｍ t l .c o ｍ

 "Hello, brother who makes my sister cry"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, uhh, uhh, uhh ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman who suddenly looks at me and smiles at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, brother? What the hell...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked, the woman sighed and frowned. No, no, I don't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Slaya said something like this, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why, in the last few days, I've been standing up to a bunch of narcissistic people who are known to everyone...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, he said he doesn't know. Why don't you go somewhere, unknown to the present generation, even if you have a big title? Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's a bounty neck in the world that's been arranged for over a decade, like a hack, and you're a tool store manager for swallowing without hunting it either? Slaya."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh man... I didn't see him... but the shadow... one of the Seven Brave Men," Espi "huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Women don't seem to get along with Slaya...... hmm? Trayna? What's wrong now?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh, es... pi... eh? and Qiyong......!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, I'm surprised. I'm surprised. ♪ But don't you remember?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, the last time I saw you... was when you were still saying ogre ogre... and I couldn't let you hold me much"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... oh, you...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, I miss you ~. Let me hold you, Sadis..." Yes, it's been ten seconds. It's over. Boy, you can hold me. The time is over. Sadis is the only one who can hold Boy all the time '... because he told me what to say and he took it up right away. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn't look like a lie... this guy... knows me too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr ansl a ted b y ｊp ｍtl .ｃ oｍ That's what Trayna's saying, too, and I figured you were sure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A real...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi of the Seven Braves...... because? What do you want from me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if this guy's one of the real Seven Brave Men, you can't just stand there and bawl at Nonki.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I panicked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You said you found me... you mean you were looking for me? Have you been told by your fathers? What are you gonna do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if this guy is an old friend of my father and mother, let alone looking for me, I can imagine that he came to bring me back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Espi, contrary to my expectations, sighed bitterly...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nothing. Hiiro and Maam have nothing to do with it. I've come to preach to you and beat you up with one shot."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The worst man to make my sister cry."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Making my sister cry? What? What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only thing that comes to mind when you tell me I'm your sister... Amae...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T r a n sl a t e d by jpm tl .ｃ om "I don't care, my client is me. Will you come back later? Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, between me and Espi, who laughs at me so confused, this again came in a muddled slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, hey, you're a lady first, Slaya! I'm gonna blow it!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, you? You want to try me? You're a selfish, painful woman."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Selfish? That's the same for you, isn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm gonna lose to you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what do these guys have to do with these guys?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One-touch instant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something's changed the air and it hurts billy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Speaking of which... Espi and this slayer...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhm... all I know is that Espi helped Slaya, who was once a genius boy hunter, where he was captured after losing to Noja..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I did hear about that connection at the tool store.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there's more to this...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, I'm going to make curry with your brother now. Will you stay out of my way?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Currie?...... Callie!? I want to eat. I want to eat!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr ansla t e d b y Ｊp ｍt l .ｃ o m Hmm? What? There's another situation in the words Slaya said... Espi suddenly shuddered away from the instant air...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, so I'll help you make Currie, too, so I guess I'll just have to bust it afterwards, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Good. You're right... yeah... there's something I want to give you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! Why would I do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why does Currie take precedence so far? Besides, Carrie, if I make it, can I smash it? I don't know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, wait, Temee et al! If you'd listened to me in silence earlier, what the hell was that all about! After all, what is the purpose of the Seven Brave Men?! The ones who made my sister cry, you mean Amae?! Then we've already solved it! We've made up already, and we even got chews on our cheeks!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You can't leave my sister crying! Or is that it? I don't really know what's going on, but I've heard rumors about you, like a sister's share for my father and mother! Are you trying to get me to stick around here? Ahem?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "For the most part, the manager there suddenly showed up without a look on his face and perplexed things... how much I like Currie!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was a party to the boulder, I accidentally screamed beyond the limits of frustration at the two of them as they proceeded to talk on their own with the outside treatment of mosquito nets.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then you two look at each other...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you got mad because of Slaya."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, I'm pissed off because of you"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's the fault of both Temeer and the others! Uzzy bastards!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They pushed each other's responsibilities, so I yelled at them again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, do you have a 'master key'?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you have it, then you're perfect already. Now... you're going to get what you want... then yeah... okay..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was shocked by the abrupt question from Espi's mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi, who didn't have to ask the answer to how I looked like that, was unnecessarily Niyaniya and...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This guy... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina is also staring sharply at Espi without understanding his sincerity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, it's like I don't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything about this woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi and Slaya nod at each other...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, let's just apologize. I'm sorry, did my 'boyfriend' bother you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry. My 'girlfriend' made me uncomfortable."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………… ...... ugh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boop!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something more amazing has come up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
