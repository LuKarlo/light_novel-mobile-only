 I don't know what to translate. I'm getting a headache.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The mysterious woman who suddenly appeared knows me in the espi of one of the Seven Brave Men, some headache guy trying to hit me by pushing an unexplained cause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, is there an extraordinary obsession with Currie, the weird guy who brings a wazzy, hidden coffee to my place where he just meets and instead tries to cook it with me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought such a woman and a man gave a touch of instant air...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you guys a couple? Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh my... such a connection..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stumbled in, and Trayna sighed like a jerk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi and Slaya look at me... T rans l a ted b y jpｍtl.ｃ o m

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Because I'm not married. Because I didn't do the wedding. So, I don't even have kids. Marriages and weddings must be properly authorized by each other's families. ""
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I didn't hear anything! I'm not even interested! You know, we were about to have a fight earlier, but here's a perfect place to breathe word for word!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was certainly surprised when they told me that you two were lovers. But nothing, so I don't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either that, or you can call it a good fit for each other in this self-absorbed selfish thing that people do without worrying about their circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don't know about each other hanging out with each other in their own right, but I don't have any interest in it in the first place, and it doesn't matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you two sighed blatantly at my words like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha-ha, did you hear that, Slaya? Is that what you're saying? T rans l ate d b y Jp ｍ tl .ｃ oｍ

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, it's terrible."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm already twenty-three, aren't I? It's not uncommon for people to get married in their teens, and I want you to guess what's going on in today's world where they're still not married, right? You're an idiot, aren't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Marriage can't just be formed by mutual feelings. Naturally, I can step out happy for the first time after being blessed by my loved ones. I can't believe you don't even know that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like you don't know what's going on with me as an adult. You're saying you're a kid, and you're looking for my frustration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know what? You can marry me or whatever you want!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child, don't get caught up in the pace......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina...... but......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Trayna came to my ears trying to calm me down like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hi these guys... I don't know what else. Perhaps we should watch how things go now...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna is calm, unlike me who's upset. And he has a look of surprise somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I don't even know a guy named Slaya... or this espi... who I once fought against, but now I don't really know. Well, the last thing I knew about this guy was that I couldn't help it because I was about 7-8 years old...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... have you changed as an adult?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'It's possible. Besides, this girl has always been a smart girl, and most importantly, she wasn't the one who would totally deliver justice or justice like the Hiiros... but...'

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna still doesn't seem to be able to come up with an answer, and she doesn't even say clarity and espi are "enemies" or "run".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead I say "see how it goes" and on top of that......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'There's just one thing you know... Espi and Slaya... these guys... boy, it doesn't seem like they have any bad feelings for you, does it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No, no, the Espi one says bust or something!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Um, that's why I don't know. These guys... what's the purpose... and how does Espi know that a child has a master key...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, no, it is. The master key was given to me by Paris in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it was the other day that Paris and I connected like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He forced my brother to give me something like that gift.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, how does this woman know I have a master key?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm definitely curious.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, let's get ready for Currie for now"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, brother. Let's cut vegetables together."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, you guys, wait a minute! Even if they suddenly say that!? I mean, I've never cut a vegetable before!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Cause once upon a time, I was only about ten?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had Thaddess's birthday and I always wanted to thank her for trying so hard to cook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I went into the kitchen with Cosoli and tried to cook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I'll make Gohan for Thaddess's birthday... uh, the knife...

 - Oh, Sadis... Oh, I'm trying to make dinner for Sadis...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Boy, I'm glad to hear that, but the knife is quick on Boy. No, there's no need for Boy to cook. Don't take my life away from me, because it's my life to cook rice for you, son.

 Something happened, and Sadis wouldn't let me hold the knife... so, Traina! Don't look at me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... Really? ~... You're a brother raised to be overprotective for a long time... Is it Sadis's fault?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... you can't cook yet... that's a little troublesome..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, these two stupid couples mock me too...... big favor!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When that happens...... what's up? If you can't make Currie... first..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Right. I just want to eat curry... but when I get here already... okay. In the meantime, I'll give you this coffee. Now you're gonna train me to make a proper curry."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I think Traina figured it out, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something came up here and all of a sudden, the air between the two of us changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What are you trying to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... I need a favor"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What the..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me and Slaya... I need your help"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No. You're not trying to do something to me, do me a favor?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, help?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, everything's too abrupt, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then again, I bared my voice that it was the limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahaha, I knew it...... right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Holy shit! In the first place, you don't know anything from the moment you show up until now! The only thing I know is that he's one of the Seven Brave Men, the manager's lover, and he's about to go fuck himself anyway! So do me a favor? I don't know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, you don't get it. Yeah.... yeah... well... I don't know how you explained it... but I can't tell you everything from one to ten... just give me this..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when Espi gave me something, with a look like he was cutting somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something in a cloth bag, enough to fit flat in your hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Take this... I want you to go for the ruins of Sisonotami. With me and Slaya."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? I don't like it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh? That's terrible. I want you to listen to me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's the attitude of the guy who wants people to listen to him. Typically, Temeer is the one who doesn't even listen to people talk about busting me or anything!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Oh, you're so noisy about the details of a man's ass. I'm gonna kick your ass, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what they're trying to give me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if this guy's favor was to take these two to the ruins of the example, I would have categorically declined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh? It's been an on-parade of legendary residents for the past few days... I'm not licking it, but you think I'm freaking out because every one of the Seven Brave Men threatened me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... something... really... mucky"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Assuming this woman is up to something, and depending on the circumstances, she's going to force me to do something... I wish for a bee battle with the Seven Braves, but in some situations, it's not a rush.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I changed the air I emit again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, stop it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya walked in between us and embarrassed Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi swelled her cheeks like she was infidel, too, but she never did anything to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Buh, I know. But I don't even know what's going on here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's your fault"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah! Just Slaya, Bricko! Ah, annoying annoying annoying. Bye. Yes, for now, just take this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Espi threw a cloth bag at me and I recieved it reflexively.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
