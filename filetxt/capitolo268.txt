 Yes. Even if surrounded, don't panic, calm down, and "put" your consciousness on it.

 'That's right.

Bring to life an image that stretches magic around you.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of sucking your magic out of the atmosphere, let it stain the atmosphere and share your senses with you.

 This is a different technique than breakthroughs that magically strengthen your own body or the Great Demon Helix that releases and maintains all magic in one place.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it means broadening the magic that I have been focusing on myself and only one place on my right arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Further, maintain it. Quite a nerve-wracker for that.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, whoa!? Say... damn..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won't wait forever to see if I'm focused on Chintara.

 If this is the way to stop the movement, the flying gear hits from all sides relentlessly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the trouble is, if I try to do this magical radar, I use quite a bit of nerve, so on the contrary, I'm unconscious of anything else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the radar doesn't activate, I'm just jizzing and roaring, so if there's an attack from the darkness that I just can't see there, it's unnecessarily inevitable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Always move around, concentrated and activated...... this...... this, quite difficult!

 "Huh!? Also, fly... Grr,... I'll come forever!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Another arrow flew in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I managed to avoid it because I was focusing my consciousness a little over that way thinking, "Maybe it'll fly".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 'That's no good. It's just dodging a bow and arrow that's been made critical with your eyes on the brink'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I did it with fear, not radar, but simply looking and then dodging.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't miss that, too, Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Don't be afraid. You've scratched a stronger attack. Don't be afraid of some injuries.'

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... it's the heart, isn't it?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I know. But that's how the body behaves regardless of its own will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, Aka's punch is stronger, and to that kind of thing I jumped in and countered without fear of damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the visible attack became "ready," but the invisible attack could not be prepared, and the body would be stiffened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if an enemy attack hits you while you're just focusing on Magical Radar Mastery? What if I hit your head, your eyes, your heart?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not to mention cuddling a little kid now...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What's that supposed to mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To translate, you want me to abandon myself and tell you to run away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't care anymore... I've come this far... the mission has failed... and that's why I exist -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So I'm telling you to talk about yourself, the stupidity of infidelity rotting, and all that stuff later!

 "Hih..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, don't make up your mind! I don't have a reason to abandon you, that's okay!

 It's because you're such a kid!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't help but raise my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, why do you think this is happening to Temeer?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh? I failed... lost to Gouda..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No! It's because of the brave Hiiro and Maam! Because those two aren't taking care of their people's mental health! Yes, blame it all on the brave! Why did you fail your mission?

 'Here, boy... that's too rambling, isn't it? The circumstances, circumstances and context of the world at the time were also complicated…'

 'Don't get kids involved in complications! I knew my stupid father was worse than I got involved! You don't have to think so! Even if this is war and this is the normal world and times, I don't want to think this is the right thing to do!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... haha... not at all..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Circumstances? Know. I can't do anything with a brave man who should be able to do anything, so I have this kind of kid in my eyes.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, that's why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But don't worry. I'm the man who will eventually accomplish more than that brave man. I mean, I dare you to do what the brave can't do! So definitely help Temeye! Espi!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... beyond Hiiro...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I declared that, one thing that was out of me disappeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fear of an attack by the Demon King's Army flying while concentrating on mastering the Magical Radar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That fear prevented me from concentrating my consciousness until the end and consequently from activating the radar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's weird.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I uttered this kid that I would absolutely help him, my fear disappeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... well... it was annoying to you to bring up the circumstances before you were born...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time that I heard Traina laugh, I realized...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?... I'm flying"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't even have to listen to Traina's instructions, and on the contrary, I didn't see anything, but I took a half step back from the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately after that, a bow and arrow passed right in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rubble, majority. From left…"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A soldier from the Demon King's Army without getting his hair in... he threw a stone at me, but he dodged it without difficulty, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I know everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can sense it now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ha ha, good or bad... you got caught on radar. At this moment, this is the child, your world!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that word, I had a laugh in my mouth naturally, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, the Demon King's Army is a little surprised that I'm suddenly avoiding the attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm stopping my foot, which was slowly approaching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are you gonna do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Now about twenty people pick up the stone at their feet... what? Are you saying, 'Send the signals and throw them all at once'?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, behind twenty, twenty more are holding stones and arrows to refrain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, there's also a time difference attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "They're already within enemy range of the child's radar in an attempt to stop them. Within that range, even a whispering conversation can be sensed. i.e.…… '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now! Throw it all at once!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Yikes!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The stone throws a bit of control apart, assuming I avoid it back and forth, left and right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A stone of about fist size is at the same time...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Previously, he was a child who had been able to evade after seeing his opponent attack. If you know where to attack ahead of time... no one will ever catch you again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical Step!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hih, wow, ah... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't feel like hitting it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden, my movements changed. Even if I can't see my face or figure, I'm surprised all the Demon King Army people are opening their mouths, and I know it all now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Okay. But don't get too worked up! The depth of this technology is not to this extent. What you're wearing is the foundation you're still wearing! Besides, the Magical Radar scrapes more nerves than it activates to keep it going. You can't do this for long. [M] In the last few seconds, get everything out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then Trayna pushed my back out, stabbing the nail to tell me not to get on with it, and on top of that, suggesting that this force had "still ahead".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
