<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two of the seven heroes who saved the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and mother, who is also a hero of mankind, were sitting side by side with the maid, Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry about this, Sadiz. I’ll give this idiot a good talking to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To think he’s such a fool… If he was trying to do this without our knowledge… I’m sorry, Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz is not just a maid to my father and mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s like a sister, like a daughter, and she’s family to all of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My order to show me panties towards such a family member was so bitter to both of them, and after beating me senseless, I single-mindedly apologized to Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nfufufufu ~ It’s fine ~ Master and Madam. Little man is at that age, being interested in a female body wearing panties isn’t weird ~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Sadiz did not seem hurt at all, and had her grinning smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how you look at it, Sadiz is teasing me, you can tell by looking at that face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good grief, Earth. Will you reflect on this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, my father poked at my forehead again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, for goodness sake. I’ve heard you’re hiding smut, though you’ll soon be an adult, just so you know I’ll be asking Sadiz about things!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, pulling my ear, no matter how you look at it, is a teenager. Or rather, she looks about the same age as Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A woman who looks more like a girl, ties her long redhead to the left and right, is dressed in a white party dress, and has sharp, dazzling eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, her age is actually thr-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uraaaah, are you listening?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gagh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, she has poor-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here’s another shot, for some reason!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gohg!?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As one of the seven heroes, she helped defeat the Great Demon King Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… she is as loud as ever. Mamu… Even this loathsome person evokes nostalgia.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, my mother, Mamu Lagaan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, I thought both Father and mother were at work…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We heard you were lying unconscious and suffering, so we came during our break!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “However, as we came back, trying to get Sadiz to show you panties, what were you thinking!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was hit by two people one shot at a time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, I wasn’t even aware of their presence, so I was focused on Sadiz’s panties …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I did wrong, sorry. Anyway, I’m all better now. So you can both go to work n-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell are you saying? Let me get this, we get back to work, so you can do what exactly?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, are you sure you’re okay? I haven’t been home at all recently, but he isn’t doing anything indecent, is he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’ve been asked about boobs… Oops, this was a secret, ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Ah-heh!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And again, I was beat up. Damn, hey! We had a deal… [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I glared at Sadiz as I thought so, but she was putting on tepid a face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, since it’s been so long why don’t Master and Madam have dinner before they return? Together with Lil’ Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wh… W-Wha?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…Yeah, that’s also true. I’m hungry, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’ve got a little time before the evening meeting. That’s true.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was speechless again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I look at Sadiz’s face again, she had a smile that says, ‘Please do your best’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, it’s been awhile since I’ve had Sadiz’s homemade cooking!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz. I’ll help you, let’s make it together for the first time in a while♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’d be glad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, nothing is wrong with having a meal with my family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, it is a matter of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is a rare case for my house.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both my father and mother were busy, and there was almost no chance to eat together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t feel lonely, I was used to it, and it was quite natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, when it comes to having a meal with the whole family on the contrary, I felt a little bit on guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiro! Earth! Wait in the living room.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well then, Little man, I’ll be here♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, my mother went to the kitchen with Sadiz, and as a result, father and I waited alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s kind of awkward, it felt weird.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it’s a lot of fun to eat together, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… I forget.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s really awkward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”……………… Um…… “”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes father…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you’re saying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s nothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”………… “”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you two just meeting each other?』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar plays the straight man at our awkward state. [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed amused for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How’s the Academy?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… not bad…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T-That so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, which reminds me, Fu and Rebal are back. Seems they’ve gotten stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… It looks like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to attend the next game, both your mother and I. Show me your hard work.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hard work…… Seriously, my training pushes me between life or death. I doubt that’s the kind of thing you’d think about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “C-Come to think of it, you’re going to do something about a girlfriend soon, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hah? What? All of a sudden.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s about time, I wonder if…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-I’m not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right? You were doing something strange to Sadiz… How about the princess? Did you do something rude?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course not. Well, the princess doesn’t even like me, does she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wha? What are you talking about? The princess… doesn’t like you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you see it, you’ll get it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No, you… Well, that’s what you feel…this, happens a lot…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nnh, so hazy. Why do I have to discuss my love life with my father?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, well, that’s not it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I’m talking with my father like this, there are a lot of questions I’ve been thinking of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, dad…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father… Why did you become a warrior… Did you want to be an 【Imperial Knight】?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I really wanted to hear was… not this. Probably.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I haven’t been able to sort out what I want to ask my father in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar said I should have some interest in my father. But to inquire about my father, I didn’t know what to ask, and I was listening to his rambling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… Oh, you’re about to submit your [Volunteer Warrior’s Notice].”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… at first…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? You’re probably wondering if you’re going to be an 【Imperial Knight】, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… rather than being lost, I’m not sure why I should be an 【Imperial Knight】.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m worried about going to the 【Imperial Knight】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I began to talk about it, his father began to panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it seemed for certain that I would join the 【Imperial Knights】 even to my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, certainly with your grades you’re entitled to it… It was really hard but your dad became an 【Imperial Knight】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve heard that it was easier in the past, but even so it was difficult for my father…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, my father was an inferior student. My overall ranking is second in the grade, so I’m much better than he was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there is no one who says I’m above my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I had not been conscious of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why did you want to be an 【Imperial Knight】?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did my father, who was an inferior student, want to be an 【Imperial Knight】, worked hard and was able to defeat the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why was that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Your dad… Let’s see…… There were times when I wanted to protect my friends and those I cared about, but… In the end, I fought for the sake of humanity and the world. But…… originally…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was what he wanted to protect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After he came to be called a hero, he began to fight for mankind and the world from the bottom of his heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that wasn’t the case from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… I wanted to be on the side of justice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the first time I’m hearing this from my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When I was a kid, my father and mother were still living in a rural village… I was saved from a monster attack by an ally of justice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew only the ‘achievement’ of my father as a hero. I heard that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I also… I wanted to be someone who can be there to help in that way. It all started there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The beginning of the father. That is, the origin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That person… Was it an 【Imperial Knight】?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… He helped us, and left without leaving a name as it is. However, to the person it seems natural to help. I thought it was cool. I admired that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father talks to me with eyes shining like a kid somewhere in a shy way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m simple. When we were to be on the side of justice in our time, we felt like an 【Imperial Knight】. So I wanted to be an 【Imperial Knight】 and be on the side of justice… or so I thought.” [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now he has fulfilled that dream and he is still saving and protecting many people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I listened to my father seriously for the first time, and I thought he was dazzling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’m more worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have that feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So what do I want to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Okay! She’s psychic. Confirmed!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] With how often he gets beat up by heroes, Earth might actually end up being a Demon King!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] The original statement here, 貴様ら、お見合いか？？, Tre’ainar is asking whether they were on a Matchmaking date, cause they’re so awkward it seems like their first time meeting each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] The phrase used here is Tsukkomi. It’s from a traditional style double act comedy where there’s a boke (funny man) who provides the material (gags, misunderstandings, slapstick) and tsukkomi (straight man) who butts in and reacts with logic and verbal takedowns towards the boke’s antics.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S5] I’ve always thought this series had a resemblance with Boruto. This kinda confirms it. Earth and Hiro even have similar character dynamics with Boruto and Naruto.
