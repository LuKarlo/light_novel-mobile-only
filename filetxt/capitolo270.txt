 The first thing I remember is a world full of adults around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Is this the girl? An unusual daughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yes. There's no magic chanting, just holding hands to make everything float, destroy, emotional swings make it even more intense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - My real parents seemed to have died in the war, and then they got into the hands of a slave trader, but it seemed out of hand... but this was an unexpected pick up
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - If you keep this guy well, he'll show great power on the battlefield. We can show strength to the weak, the small and the other countries that were looking down on us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - All right, give it a try and gauge his potential. On top of that, educate them so they can't defy you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They let things float, twist bend, float in the sky, and if they could do that, they fed me Gohan.
</div>

 I was slapped for not being able to. Tr a ns l a ted by jpmt l .c o ｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I only broke someone slapping me all over once, I'd be trapped in the dark and give me nothing to eat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't go wrong anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll be a good boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So go Han.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't slap me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Oh, the treasure of my country, Espi. You will be given the title of Seven Brave Men today. Recently, he was recognized for his achievements in striking the army of the Toddler Girl Fighter General Noja by himself.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Uh-huh. You're a good boy. I think of you like a daughter. All right? You listen to them. Don't listen to anyone from other countries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yes, I understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Always report information from other countries. Get off guard with the kid, they might talk to Pepper about information, too. And...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - If the other seven brave men are seriously wounded in battle, and no one around them in doing so... kill them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Are you one of them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Alliance, not companionship. When the war is over, you will be the next enemy. Ready? Our treasure, Espi. For the sake of the future of this country, all you have to do is listen to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll listen to whatever you have to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll do what I'm told.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hey, you're the Espi! Say hello! Me, I'm a hippo!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hey... put these kids in war for as much as you want... and if anything happens, you can count on us, okay? Because we're one of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They won't get along because they'll be enemies sooner or later, and they're the ones who might kill them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hey, Espi... You're this kid, Sadis. Your father and your mother are dead... hey, you and I are close, and could you be friends? Oh, hey, Espi, don't ignore me ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other Seven Brave Men are not one of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Espi, I give you an important assignment. Demon King's Army, one of the six great demon generals... assassinate Gouda the demon giant god. This shapes the future fate of our nation. Failure is unacceptable. Whatever happens, let it succeed. Whatever happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My people are... just people from the same hometown...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Are you sure? If Espi dies here...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I know. But how low our contribution is compared to the Seven Brave Men and Warriors of Empire and Japone...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Take the risk. But we need big credit. Otherwise, they'll tell you to pay more instead of fighting! Mostly, no matter how rampant Espi is, it will be sumptuous before the martial arts of the Imperial Hiiros! Not like this! We really need so much credit that the world will admit it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I'm no longer useful, I won't need it.
</div>

 "Huh!? Yes, ……………"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a dream. When I open my eyes, at night. Was I asleep?

 Physical pain.
