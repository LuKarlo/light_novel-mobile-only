 Something's gone wrong...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it's true, I wanted to say goodbye by returning Espi to the coalition as soon as possible when I finished some care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the crying Espi never left me again yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi sleeps tight with his hands and legs wrapped around my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We had no choice but to go wild and we slept in the woods twirling into one cape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew, ahh... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I woke up, Espi was riding over my chest and sleeping bursting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His eyes are sobbing, but he is also tired and his expression is calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And... it's still a little dark... did you wake up too soon?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you awake? Was it hard to sleep with the weight on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh... well, I'm used to this stuff with amae"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Right."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr an s lat ed b y jpｍt l.ｃ oｍ I wake up in the morning and Traina and I laugh bitterly at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who can imagine a child sleeping on me like this now being my father's comrade of war, the seven brave men that Traynas were once the natural enemies of the Demon King's Army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Though the Seven Brave Men, they're still children and children... well, that's... the same thing with the Hiiros of this era"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I snorted at Traina's words, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I don't know that much about Espi's past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just roughly heard what the adults who were around Espi were saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that just made me think I couldn't pretend not to see this guy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'More than that, child. Wake up and take a deep breath.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Yesterday's radar treat?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No, simply... try to get out of the woods for a moment, breathing a little cooler air in this nature. There are no Allies or Demon Kings around now. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some kind of plot-faced Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what you're thinking, but if Trayna says so, and I don't wake up an espi, I try to gently untie the hands and feet of an espi wrapped around my body...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yo, like this... like this, out -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi, suddenly freaking out his body, opened his eyes and blinked loudly at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boulder is the Seven Brave Men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have you noticed any slight signs?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Hey, good morning"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... good morning"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Did you get some sleep?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well..."
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why don't you wrap your hands and feet around my body again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... let's get up, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, even if he looks a little musty... how much does this guy forgive me for one night?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That makes it easy to sweeten up... No, you don't...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other way around: 'I'm not used to getting emotions from people so much that my heart is shaken by that degree'.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I had a complex to my parents, I was blessed with something and was spoiled by Thaddess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I only spoke a little yesterday... but it's kind of embarrassing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Oh man, I can't help it. It's time for the two of you to go outside for a little while.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, sighing at us like that, Trayna said it again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what you mean, but for now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, let's take a walk"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Yeah... I'm in the basket..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little musty espi, but when I asked him out properly, he honestly followed me in line next door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 I don't know. I don't know what kind of conversation to have.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I don't know if I'm going too far into it... but if it's okay to preach any more, I'm just going back to the time when I was there on the clock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that's what Espi, too, is going to see me flicker from just now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, there was a valley in front of us out of the woods, and under our eyes there was another great forest, and beyond that we could see the mountains.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from beyond that mountain...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dazzling sunlight... it's sunrise...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a little cold, but when I inhale this natural clear air, I feel as fresh as if it's being purified from the depths of my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The body that was falling asleep also wakes up immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something about the past, the war, the past of Espi, and above all, what my father and mother were doing, even feeling a little complicated, calms me down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Espi. Which one?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... on the other hand, if you're camping on the battlefield, you'll see it carefully..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah. I always take a good look..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Today is better than usual... I think it's great"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi shows a lot of soppo oriented, less honest but less bad looking response.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey. Name..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's your name? Tell me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Name... Speaking of which, you left a lot of teasing yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, we can't call it "Earth Ragan"...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, child."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? What the hell, Traina?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Speaking of names... there would have been a forged ID that Palippi gave you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... ah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The one I got with the master key.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's in my pocket with it in a small box...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fish in your pockets.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When you open the small box, inside, the ribbon that was tied to the box and the ID that was folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Tapil Bael.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not cool...... dismissed. I don't like it. I put my ID back in the box.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is strangely necked, but give me a break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Make it a cooler name!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell, what's this name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More like this... Schneider, Grand Cross...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what's your name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh... you can't tell me... well, call me whatever you want"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I don't know what that means"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my God, what a name."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I don't care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi looks fine, and I'm not going back to the future anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the moment the cold wind blew a bit in the morning, Espi's long hair messed up and hit his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if I were going to tell the story, my hair was messed up by Espi...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wop......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my hair's so long... look, I'll do this, so just tie it up a little bit"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A white ribbon that was tying a small box sent by Paris Pi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nothing. There's no point in wrapping it around the box again, or throwing it away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? This, this... this is what you're gonna do with it to me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You helped me, you gave me dinner... you slept with me... ever..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm exaggerating! It's not that big of a deal, and I can't help but give it to you. It's a present, a present."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... a gift..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know you'd react so far with one cheap ribbon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You've never been through anything like this before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then Espi picked up a ribbon from me, shaking in small pieces, and hey, aren't your eyes moist?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A gift... for the first time..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, well?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah. I've never even had a ribbon..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... but I don't know how to tie it, do I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I've never done this before... but Maam's always got hair... do this, do this..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when I thought, "Ah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina... the future espi, it was a slightly worn ribbon..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Is that what you mean...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But these are the ribbons that Parippi wore to tie the little boxes. It's nothing. It's not a bow for binding hair purely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't believe this guy's been doing that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... well? Is she cute like Maam?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, aren't you cuter than Maam?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi dyed his cheeks a bit and circled on the spot in a kull.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just a little bit, but for the first time I've seen a smile zero in Espi's mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "........................................................................................................."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... thank you... brother..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, Kuha! Whoa!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that what you've been calling me... just a little closer to that future espi smile?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And you'll be fine now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, you look fine too... can we get you home from here to the Coalition? I have to go now, too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, alle!? He suddenly turned his expression on me as if Espi had been stained with despair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, I'm going... Duh, where are you going?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah. No, me too, I have to go home..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... together... let's go to the coalition."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, brother, we're strong... together... oh, dear..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I can never do that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shit, Espi's picking my clothes hem with her fingers as she's about to cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, there's no way I can go to the Coalition if I'm solicited like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Already in many ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... then... I'll go with you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I failed my mission... and I don't want to go home anymore..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no, you can't do that any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna also has her head in a boulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I'm going back to the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, me, I've failed my mission, but I'll try my best to be useful... and I'll be stronger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, that's not the problem..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll tell you what, 'cause I'm gonna be a better kid... so... keep up with you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, a second development here recently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't expect a toddler girl to ask me to go this far... this is already happening in Amae...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, you know -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's just not good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As one of the Seven Brave Men, Espi is a hero who will also be active in future wars.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I'm gone, I don't know what history has to do with me.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever you do, you're going back to the Allies... to your fathers...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... hmm? Hey, kid! Pockets opposite...... those with clocks in them!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? That's when Trayna sounded like she noticed something and raised her voice. Pockets or watches?

 "Hmm? What is this? The clock's flashing?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dial of the clock is flashing with tickles. I didn't do anything, but I've never seen anything like it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, something weird is gonna happen again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait, with items that can go in the past or in the future, what happens...

 "Huh? The clock, you talked...?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Charging Citekdasai]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, nah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told him the clock didn't make any sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But without knowing what that was in the end, the clock eventually stopped saying un or sung after repeating the same words.
