 Simply pressing the button on the pocket watch allowed the clock to shine and move a lot.

 But now, no matter how many buttons I push, swing up and down to try, or tap lightly, nothing changes.

 Espi is wearing his little neck strangely. That's all I'm upset about right now.

 Somehow, this is the time before I was born.

 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, beside me in panic, Trayna had a sober look as if she was convinced somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Perhaps this watch... is powering some energy, not magic. It would be about the technology of the ancients'

 "Huh!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... I mean..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The future espi expected this to happen. The only way to move that clock is to use the technology found in the ruins of Sisonotami. And on that journey… I mean accompany the Espi of this era '

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... hey, what!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what they say, and I think back to my conversation with Future Espi.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T r a nsl ated b y jp ｍtl.ｃ oｍ Sure, that's what we were talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Take that... I want you to go for Sisonotami with me and Slaya. I know you're saying something unsolicited. But, you know, that's what we want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Brother, I will meet you and travel with you to Sisonotami... that is our wish. I don't know anything about us... I want you to lead us.

 "Suck? Hey, brother, what's going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, what's worse than taking Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't be silly. Espi's one of the Seven Braves, isn't he?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're one of the Allied's best fighters, aren't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said we're in the middle of a war right now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'But Espi himself doesn't want to go home... he says he's going with him... I guess that's what I mean. For a certain period of time, you must have a history of acting with Espi…'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'So, but one of the seven brave men took the liberty of doing that...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Honestly, I don't know any more information that Espi was gone during the war... but... if a coalition that doesn't want to give such information to mankind or to the Demon King's Army has been covering up information for a while...'

 I mean, I'm going to have to take this espi and cross the ocean again for Sisonotami.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Huh!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How much agitation and shock does this actually cause the Coalition to run, maybe I can get chased from the Coalition? Even with the anxiety that, for now, as the future Espi says, we seem to have to act together.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Espi jumped at me for my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, I, I'll help you so much... I'll give you a shoulder or something!

 I was sweet on Thaddess when I was about this...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, Traina. I'm going across the ocean again for now...... what happens to the war here? Sure, there's a six-human Gouda, isn't there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hmm? Oh, that's no problem. In past history, even if Gouda plundered part of the imperial territory, he should have immediately withdrawn in engagement with the armies of the Solja of the Seven Braves'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With Your Majesty? Oh, really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Um, it was just like a restraint, so I didn't give the rest of you directions to go too deep"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well... but it feels so light when the Seven Brave Men and the Six Hegemonies engaged..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not uncommon. The war between the demons and humanity is a repetition of being taken or taken territory. Both the Six Champions and the Seven Braves fought each other many times. Looks like the guys at Bettrail tried to do something a lot sooner... '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, before I left, I was horrified to find that there seemed to be no such thing as' history had changed because Espi wasn't there '.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... then we'll go by boat..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "............ hmm?

 Is that it? I'm going by boat...... me...... how much do you have now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are the currencies changing?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Currency hasn't changed... but I'm almost out of possession at the tool store...'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whew!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... the cost of the trip..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was going to live a while...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, once again, when I fish in my pocket, it's just a little bit of gold... then I can't get on the boat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, you don't have any money?

 "Hey, no, no, don't worry about the kid's money!

 'Hmm? Wait... this time of year for sure... and this land...'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was then.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ah! Right... I mean, you know... oh, I see... you mean... that's what happened! "Array" will be held on schedule even during the war... "

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna squeaked something with a hazy look like she noticed something.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hey, kid. Cross the ocean on a different route from the future'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Straight south from here, there's a big city. About three days on your feet. It's a city called "Vienna," and it's peaceful because it's not caught in a war. "

 'Vienna? Yeah, I've been there when I was a kid... Really? But I don't have any money to go there, so the ship has...'

 'I'm fine. There's a golden athe.'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina's suggestion that I don't even think about.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you kidding me?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when I realized I had one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have an ID, albeit a forgery, right now.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As a Hunter"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, not that way"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'What...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew I was gonna be a hunter and get rid of monsters and stuff like that...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hehe, if you go to a city of quite a size, you'll have an array...'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Arre?"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hey, kid... you know something called' Off-site Ticket Office '?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then a very unexpected word popped out of Traina on Doya's face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
