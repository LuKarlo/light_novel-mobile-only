<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is making my little body shrink even further with tension in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's as far as I can get him to eat the cake...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, don't be shy."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the next moment, Espi's whole body jumped in a freak and a flower blossomed on his expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh... sweet no, hey, hi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi, who was like a doll until a few days ago, cheeked strawberry shortcakes with a grin so full that his cheeks were about to fall off already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, this is so yummy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, eat as much as you like. You want some chocolate over here, too?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, is that okay!? Yeah!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Muschamsha, have some cake with Moschamosha and have some juice... it's gonna hurt your teeth ~? I was horrified at the way Espi looks at eating sweet things happily as a child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is how he laughs properly, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You never had a cake?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! It was just hard meat and medicated drinks to strengthen my jaw"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well... Ah, clerk. Other additions......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, can I eat more?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eat as much as you like."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let's eat your brother too!

 "Oh no! I'm not the only one... I want to eat with your brother! So, ahhh!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, I'm just a little concerned about eating myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sora, I'm probably concerned about the current situation of "I'm the only one eating" because I'm so confused espi that I fed Currie or gave her a cheap ribbon.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh, shit...... Am, hmm. Nmai."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm! Right? The second best thing I've ever eaten."

 By the way, Trayna gave me a general review that night about my first curry in the dream world, but she said, "You don't know the mystery of spice".

 But I was so happy for you.

 "And because of that, we've got more military funding, and gear...... maybe we could make more of the items and camping equipment"

 'Oh. But... Still no mess...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Trayna's right, there's been a mess of increased military funding.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh well..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I found that Espi's face, which looked unexpected, was only a little lying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess it doesn't mean "I don't care at all" for boulders.

 "Wow. Look, if you're done eating, why don't we go buy some clothes?

 "What... clothes!?... Gusu... Thank you... brother... I am the happiest I have been since I was born..."

 Damn, say something cute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Time flies brutally because this is about fifteen years from now you're going to say "bust" this beloved brother or something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that word "bump" means something more, given this circumstance-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nice economy, brother. Ouilla, you're gonna be so jealous."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides being nice to girls. Does heaven give such a child luck..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To who? Are you talking to me? When I look back at the voice I hear from behind me, someone is standing in front of the cake shop entrance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A mask that covered your whole body with a coat and was made of straw on your head?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the waist holds two long and short bar-shaped pieces wrapped in a bag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oyla bought tickets too, race earlier. Then it's a big hassle... no, horses are hard."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He has a pretty good physique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The one at the waist in the bag... is that... the sword?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The lid... the large and small knife... the samurai of Japone? Even so, this man... walks one very way... from the top of his head to his toes, with a good attitude... and this voice... '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh? Did you get caught up in something on Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, me too, this suspicious Osama? I know you're not the only one...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Espi's expression clouded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then he got out of his chair, hid behind my back, and he grabbed my clothes in a giggle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I want Oyla to have some cake too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hometown dough is the best thing about sweets, but they want to throw away the cake from the Empire."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the mysterious man sat on his own in an empty chair because Espi stood, without worrying about how Espi looked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, you want some cake?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... I heard you were missing... but for now, I'm glad you're safe. Miss Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh... ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Demon King's army is taking me away... it doesn't look like he's being caught by some dangerous guy... but... you're doing it ~ are you? Everybody's worried about you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know Espi? Swordsman of Japone? Allied forces?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy, what the hell...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't go back..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no... that's trouble."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man also sighed in trouble again at the words he uttered as Espi shuddered and trembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, you're in real trouble. If Oyla reports this... they'll find out that Oyla's skipping out and coming to see us with her patience, right? Micad's Jee also pisses me off. But it pisses me off when I find my missing buddy and find out I'm leaving him alone. But when you report this and Miss Espi is brought back... the lady will cry... she will be punished... hey... if the lady wants to go like this, she wants to make it happen for you ~ hey..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keep talking to yourself with a bump in your head, but from what I can tell, you're definitely a coalition person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from this attitude toward Espi, it's pretty much in the upper position...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not in trouble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And even though it's lady-friendly, my brother doesn't know where the horse bones are taking me around... but the lady doesn't seem like a bad guy because she already misses a lot... or is she fooled... uhhhh... if you're so worried, you shouldn't have noticed"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hey, it's nothing I cheat on..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really? So, what do we do... meditate our eyes?... Oh, you're so blind - yes, haha!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel gaze. My eyes watching Espi, now they're turning on me, like they're trying to figure me out... Hmm? Are you blind? What are you talking about? It looks perfectly normal...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trayna looks like she noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fuckin 'yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Hey, lady, stay, mah, nooooooooooooooo!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the moment Espi screamed and knelt his hand at the man, something like an intense shock wave suddenly broke out and the man was plunged through the store walls to the outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-huh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Espi, oh, my God... oh, my God!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yiko, brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no. He's dead..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He's not gonna die from that. So get out of here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Espi grabbed my hand, and with his other hand he put his hand over the package at my feet and the package "floated".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Run for it! They're gonna get me! I'm not leaving! I'm with your brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, uh, oh, no more, you are!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You mean, is the dude who got flunked okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But trying to see how it goes, Espi doesn't mind pulling me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, already! I'm sorry! The store walls will be reimbursed with this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, the wall that Espi broke gave me a bag full of big money, to a confused clerk, and I was taken by Espi to run straight away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
