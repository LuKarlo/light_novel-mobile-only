 Seven brave men smash people all over the city.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes they're not the only ones, but we have to do something about Espi using his powers against this darkness in the future.

 "Brother, over here!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Another tricky thing..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi seems to want to get away with it as soon as possible anyway, but Trayna by the side looks like she held her head and was frightened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey Espi... who was that guy?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "No, you're not!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Your brother doesn't care! Your brother's going that way with me, that's fine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, you have a sense of rejection for the Coalition and your former companions about how much you don't like to be brought back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even so, child... are you allergic? Something to attract the legendary residents?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No way, I wasn't expecting it. Though coincidental, that man is in this land...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, Espi's bluffing made me Uyamuya, but Traina seemed to realize who that guy was, too. Tr ansl a t e d b y jpm t l.c om

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Damn, you're in trouble!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't want you to give me a break because when you can get away with it when people are thinking about whether to miss it or not, your body will go after you naturally!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the wind passed directly beside us, and in the middle of the city the man circled to block our way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh...... uhh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This guy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're fast. I knew you weren't the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ran away in a pretty big city with lots of people, but I didn't expect to find it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I didn't know Assari would catch up... Are you okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Never mind. It's a pretty little lady's seizure. It's not your job as an adult to laugh and take it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The thing I'm wearing on my head and the clothes I was wearing are a little torn, but it seems like it won't do much damage even though it was busted so hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, I'm a little surprised they'll catch up so easily."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "None. Miss Espi originally remembered your brother's footsteps and muscle flow. So if it's about the size of this city... wherever you run, you know what I mean? T ra n s la te d b y ｊpｍ t l .ｃoｍ

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ouilla, that's sensitive."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Footsteps? Flows? Remember? I'm curious what that means, but you know where you run?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, don't tell me. But can we get him where we found out? Look, Espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on...... wop"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care where you are, you don't have to get caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because what they said at their leisure got a little mucky...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I did when I broke through the Demon King's army in the meantime, I held Espi back and dashed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hey, don't be cool ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll pull you out. With my feint.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the opponent's reaction or slight movement, do you want to go right or left, use the cut back feint to react the opponent in reverse before unplugging.

 Is that it? What? Don't you get caught on the steps?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I left him standing right in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Head, eyes, arms, elbows, legs, knees… predict the next movement from the opponent's entire body. But sometimes the more first-rate the person you feint, the more you get caught up in it. But this man hasn't seen anything like that since the beginning... he hasn't seen it, so I'm not confused '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when Trayna's whining gets in my ear...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, I'm doing a lot of things... is that a feint? The sound of the muscles you're unwilling to pull out from the start... it's all fake... make it look like you're coming to pull it out and wait for this one to move first... the signs will tell you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I felt it all over my body at that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I can't get out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 and.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... chi..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... brother..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father and mother even pulled it out, but this guy wasn't caught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave up unexpectedly and kept my distance from the man on the backstep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr an s late d by Jpm tl .ｃom "Ohh... I've sensed it beforehand and taken the distance without going in... it's not a good decision"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see. Doesn't that seem like you're just a sweet brother?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man who laughs in a good mood under his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was just standing there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet I feel something enough to feel like I can't "fall out".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I got here, I knew who this guy was somehow...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma'am, Miss Espi,... for now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Discuss -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the man in front of me suddenly disappeared... no, trying to turn around -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Jabu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I let out the left reflexively.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man circled behind me and Espi at high speed, reaching for Espi and the pull seemed to do so, but I played that hand aggressively and kept holding Espi back again, distancing myself from the man on the back step.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ho... did you cut it off?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just a flash of defense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's all I found out, and they changed their minds about me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yay do it... this isn't a problem. You ran into me skipping... brother... don't do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The air has changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously Bishibishi and pressure come through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Not at all... but... this could be a little interesting'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh? Something's making Trayna look a little funny.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought your brother might be interested..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, the man untied the cloth string at his waist as he leaned forward. Then I saw a sword inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm not pulling that sword out, I just stand quietly with my hands on the pattern.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then why don't we have a discussion at this distance? But the next time your brother comes to pull out the oil... he might pull out the oil too. Don't you like that, brother?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, what are you talking about? You just look like you're provoking me, huh? Come and see more."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, come on, you don't know what Oyla's talking about."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man obviously asked me to "call" him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, you can't deal with him! Brother..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Play a little. child. But don't get distracted'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Trayna whispered that way to block Espi's words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Though by chance... of the training themes you have listed today... it can also be called the Polar"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'It's not like a magical radar... but the feeling of sensing something invisible and grasping the world around you... this man has it'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was an unexpected word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know men aren't the only ones, but they exist enough to make Trayna say so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not at that level.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Six wins if you're a demon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you're human, that's what you are... and... samurai of Japone...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... it's a hell of a legendary encounter rate for me too... but... okay, I'll give it a try"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ho."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I'm gonna pull out Temeer's liver.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, that's not cool!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it's "yes," it's too bad luck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered why I'd run into a legend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, if Trayna's going to say that much, even if it's me, she's also sprouting a little desire to give it a try.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
