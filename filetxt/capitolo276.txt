 I stepped in and then thought to myself left at once... but my body suddenly stopped for the next moment.

 "Huh!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 If I'd taken another step, my left hand... wouldn't it have been slashed off?

 In that forward leaning position, to that Osama who still doesn't pull his sword out of his sheath...

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, both Trayna and the man in front of me seem to have understood that I stopped "not freaking out," and I'm rather not going to react badly.

 Front, back, left, right, hands, feet, elbows, knees, both gazes. By randomly fainting everything in, you cheat all of the opponent's reactions.

 Speed is there...... faster if you use breakthroughs, but you don't know the power over there. Above all, let's see how this goes first.

 And even though the man says "trouble," the structure doesn't change consistently from the beginning.

 Don't react to me rocking with a feint, just don't move with your stomach up.

 No, but if we get to this distance, my left side is faster...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Not my movements... only perceive the moment I try to punch?

 Stupid, that...

 All Trayna has to say is, "Finished form of my current training menu".

 It would be natural for the Seven Brave Men, who are also rivals of the Six Champions.

 The shock wave rolling out of my fast fist slowed Koziloh's reaction slightly, which surprised me for a moment with my breakthrough, and Koziloh swung his sword out of his hips at high speed.

 Koziloh, who was supposed to just stand up against me and aim at the counter so far, swings his sword out here and offsets my shockwave with a high-speed slash.

 But this is what I'm after.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Koziloh will also wave down his sword with the intention of cutting me off.
