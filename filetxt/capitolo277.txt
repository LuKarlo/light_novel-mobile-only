 "Oh, hey, there's blood!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not just a fight, what's going on!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And that man, Kojiro... of the Seven Braves!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I shook up my right smash, the feeling I conveyed to my fist was the one that blew up the straw mask that Koziloh was wearing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, a slight fever in my right arm... slashed my thin skin... no problem!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Koziloh's face emerged from beneath the mask of shattered, scattered straw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Osama with a tannic feel, putting all his long dark hair together back from his forehead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those eyes were closed, and those cheeks were cut slightly with my fist now.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, Koziloh ran away, showing his back, on the verge of my left fist being unleashed... so my left swung empty...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No shame, no hearsay... I mean...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what are you running from?!? Though seven brave men!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't expect the Seven Brave Men to show their backs from before me and run away in grandeur.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Kojiro smiles at his mouth...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a brave word for Oyla that people put on their own...... how do you think Oyla could have lived through years of war?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, no...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Because you're blind, Oyla can feel more dangerous than people... not because when you finally run away, you prioritize living in disgrace but with no concern for people's eyes"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was far from the figurine of a warrior I had imagined since I was a kid when I didn't know I was going to "spare my life"...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You found it to be the samurai of Ouilla."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why when they reopened this far, I couldn't say anything either and the words got jammed...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Flicker!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, come on, this is not in the middle of a decision face yet!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won't let you redo it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Attack while the opponent is out of shape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, I want you to give me a break!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's why I'm not letting you get away...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ku... I don't have time to work on a knife extraction technique..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Koziloh escapes again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing as you can't position the counter with your sword against me, I'll use that sensing ability to escape...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait! Ra! Ra! Wow!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Speed is no match, but if you just use the prefetch to get away with it, you can handle it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This one, this one..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a float... but also the fact that you can't actually get caught.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Shit..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breakthroughs are interrupted because they've been running around... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shh... hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately base your magic on demonic breathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm? That's... magic... to!? Magic restored......!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Kojiro seemed to have sensed it properly now, and at the same time he looked surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... physical strengthening by magic... but the magic consumption was going to be so intense that when I tried to run around and aim for the moment when that magic was interrupted... you recovered... that's possible? I've never heard of you... I'm really worried about who you are."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh, what are you talking about bumps!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Instant magic recovery isn't too much of a threat... no... but now the timing of magic recovery... the moment of recovery was obviously defenceless by concentrating on it... next time I show that gap..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Koziloh puts his sword up in a state of concentration that he stuck up again like he just did, he'll be slashed at the counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beat before that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seems to be whining about something, but it doesn't matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Between me and Kojiro... something flew for Kojiro rather than...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a big barrel, and it's got contents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what floated and flew for Koziloh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, it's not dangerous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though a sudden unintended blow, Kojiro avoided it properly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But beyond that gaze...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Give me Oneechan... Kitta... Kitta Kitta Kitta Kitta Kitta Kitta..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few dozen or so barrels were placed in front of the restaurant… supposedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let it all float and stare at Kojiro...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops, isn't this another amazing danger!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi, in an angry phase...... something, the huge air hurts so much that bees and static electricity run, the pressure spreads as if it destroys everything, and everyone, including the spectators, pales their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichang Kitta! Yursanai! Kozilowsinjaeh!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, Miss Espi!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I'm young, because I've put up with a lot of things before, and if that shackle comes off, I'm going to butterfly with my emotions. Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is bad!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As a first!? Lady, look, it's not surrender! Ouilla, don't surrender to the lady's brother! See, the samurai's proud knife throws a pawy in there, doesn't it? Look, this isn't dangerous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Koziloh smiles bitterly and throws down his knife to appeal. Hey, is that all right with you swordsman?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it hasn't reached Espi's ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sinjae...... Kojiro, Sinjae!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, alas?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've been "bluffing" before, but "don't die" would be a good idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look... nice..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh... ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before Espi wielded his power, I held Espi from the front and stroked his head over and over again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi became hazy and grown up like an overflowing force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh dear..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, don't do this because it's a good one. 'Cause I'm fine."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... but... he's got your brother..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's okay. Okay? So that's enough, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could stop the rumbling, but Espi hasn't convinced me yet or is he unhappy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I desperately persuade the boulders to stop fighting between the Seven Braves here, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And don't use 'don't die' or anything like that... never..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... no?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. If you want to be with me... don't tell me you're dead, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Otherwise, why don't you take me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Okay! I won't tell you! I'm not telling you anymore! I won't tell you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 finally calmed down...... hah...... its hard to be a kid...... i will one day cron or shinob or sadis too...... hey whats up i have multiple names at the same time......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Pu...... kukuku"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha-ha-ha, shit! This is really, it's not Oyla's loss!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Koziloh laughed grandly, sitting idly on the ground and slapping his hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All right, mummy! Don't give up now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, you didn't think so much. This is a level opponent who bets everything and tries... even if he wins, he won't be safe, and Miss Espi will cry and bust him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And above all... Unlike the Oilers, who could not do anything to the lady who always cried in her heart on the top of the Buddha, your brother saved that heart... as the same man, Oiler can't point a knife at him anymore"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Koziloh has laid his abandoned sword into his sheath, smiling at me and Espi, and sticking his thumb up in a gut.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So Miss Espi, I'll leave the rest to Oyla and you and your brother will have fun going anywhere!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kojiro......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know who it is, but I can trust this brother... that's what Oyla thought."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
