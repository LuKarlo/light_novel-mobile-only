 “I didn’t know you failed at becoming an Imperial Knight… I couldn’t see you, but I never expected that possibility… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not actually…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard the origin of my father for the first time. It is a common dream of a child in this world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He wasn’t a heroic child, a chosen one, with the genes or destiny to defeat the Great Demon King from the moment he was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It started with a childish dream, and from there to the end of the story which was beyond me, is my father as he is now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… ah, listening to you like this… Even if you don’t become an Imperial Knight… If you have something else you want to do, I think it’s fine. I wanted to do it, it was my will.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’ll still… your mother too… we’ll support you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I don’t become an Imperial Knight, I’m a child of my father and mother. I guess that’s what it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow I felt myself getting hotter, in such a cringe atmosphere, as my dad seems embarrassed while he talked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, my stupid dad…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And by the way, what kind of warrior do you want to be?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, he doesn’t doubt that I’ll become a warrior?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nonetheless, what I want to do now, I’m not sure what I want to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My immediate goal is the upcoming match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not thinking about the rest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, whether or not I become a “warrior” in the first place……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is it all right? I wonder if they can talk to each other properly. Do your best ~ Earth ~ Hiro ~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Madam… If you’re worried, why don’t you go chat with them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because! It’s a father and son talk, right? It’s a difficult period, to watch over as a mother…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Madam…… Sure, Little man seems to have changed a lot recently.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I can hear something. When I glanced at her, my mother and Sadiz were watching me and my father in the shadows.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t that right? I mean, the other day you mentioned he had secretly hidden some smutty books from me in his room.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Two more books were added recently.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really!? Hey, what kind of books…? Hey, what’s it like?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Madam, your eyes are sparkling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When I found out he was hiding an ero-book, I felt the bliss of a mother realizing her son’s growth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… When you were on your adventure with the Master, you hated lewd matters. You would hit the Master for saying things like ‘Ero-erotic Great Demon’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Speak a little more quietly, we’re right here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Earth…… Well, you’re old enough to be interested in that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s with the thumb! I want to break it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stop! Such a warm gaze like ‘Father understands your feelings’ I’m a bit more embarrassed than angry!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up! Argh, what’s this old lady saying! And Sadiz reports every single thing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hnn? Koraaaa, who’s an old lady! I’m~ forever 17!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That hurts!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaaah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I spontaneously snapped, my mother had me in a headlock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Basically, you’ve been sexually harassing Sadiz, and you’re reading sex books too! Go on a date with a girl once in a while!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, it’s none of your business…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, this cheeky~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You really are restless, Mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the person herself says, it only looks like a woman of her age, including her appearance, is making a gag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, her age is thr-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, you. Miss Phianse… What about the princess? Are you getting along? Hnn hnn~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, just wow… can you, well damn. I don’t know. I’m always looked down on, I’m being preached to, and I’m fed up. Also she is, well she’s, just so-so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What’s with that face?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know~ You’re so close to a princess~. As a man~, don’t you want to make a princess your girl?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, eternal annoyance… I really wish my parents would spare me this love story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… In any case, Rebal confessed to the princess the other day. If he wins the upcoming match, he could be considered a fiancée candidate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Hoho!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, this time all three of them leaned back at the same time, with all their eyes shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys, they’re too involved in their children’s love affair!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, that so, was Rebal like that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uha~ Young Rebal will do it too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho. So, how did the princess respond?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How did the princess respond? I think back on that question, come to think of it, she didn’t even give a reply after all… At the time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. She left it unsettled.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Undecided? Why? Miss Phianse doesn’t do that, does she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, the princess usually has the impression of making quick decisions, but that time was different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I intervened without reading the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about it, I might have done wrong by Rebal… however, he’s always looking down on me and I’m sick of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I declared to Rebal…… I’m the one who’ll win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh!!?”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, because of what I said…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””And that’s the man!!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, all three of them leaned forward in their excitement, raised their voices, and hugged me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it, Earth! It’s important for a man not to retreat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a Mother, I realized your growth more strongly with those words than with sex books.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth, I’ve been hoping for a victory before, but it seems you’re serious. I’ll definitely come to cheer for you that day.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So stifling…… Yet…… Somehow, I felt like I had been building a wall until now… but, unexpectedly, when I talked about it, it was so easy… the wall…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No…… Wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s how you feel, your dad will be happy. Win or lose, it doesn’t matter. Do it to your heart’s content.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. You will do your best to win. Mothers are happy just to be there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll stand by you, Little man. I’ll support the challenge you face to the end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why not?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father, my mother, and Sadiz seemed to be satisfied with my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good. Is it because I’m so cynical about it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt that the three of them were satisfied just because I worked hard, and don’t expect me to win the championship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not just working hard. I really want to win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s also Sadiz’s reward, but that’s not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to show everyone my strength and surprise them. That’s why I’m working so hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in the first place, all three…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But Rebal and Fu seem really strong. You’re prepared for that, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know. They are stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you trying to say, ‘Don’t be disappointed even if there is too much difference in ability’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. So don’t overdo it. No matter what the outcome is, both your father and mother are watching you, aiming to win the championship.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again, that smile says ‘satisfied with words alone’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, let’s have a big feast on the day of the game. On that day, I’ll make all your favorites.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re going to have a pity party for me who can’t win the championship anyway?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good. Neither my father nor my mother, not even Sadiz said a word of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’m not even thinking about it in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe I’m just twisting it around, and simply imagining it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… Even so……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… Father…… Mom, Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””?? “””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather, I’m still a bit weary. To be honest, I don’t have an appetite. It’s been a long day, so can I take a rest today?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This wasn’t a lie. Honestly, I’m not fully healed yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it doesn’t mean I can’t eat the meal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you sure? I see…Well, don’t overdo it, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Be careful, won’t you? We can stay for a while, but… are you okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man. Sure. Then, I’ll prepare soup in case you get hungry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I said that, all three of them looked sorry, but they didn’t try to force me to sit at the table with them, and they cared about my condition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you alright?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before answering Tre’ainar’s question, I left the living room and quickly went back to my room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unable to control my restless urge, I immediately closed the door to the room and said to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar… I have a request…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was not for the sake of Sadiz’s reward, nor was it successfully inspired by Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is my will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I bowed for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I…I couldn’t win, but I did my best…I don’t want any consolation! I want to win! I want to show them, those who don’t believe I can win! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Please… I want to train me more … No … I need to train! I want to be strong! I won’t discard it no matter what kind of effort. So, please! Osu! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want a reward, I don’t want to be scuttled, I don’t want to be praised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to win. I don’t want to lose. This is my will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… child. Have you no notion of who your teacher is? Of the one who took you on as his disciple? Do you believe I would be content with merely having my disciples win a fighting championship?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But… Hmmm…, tis good to hear those words from you without the need to hang a carrot. Together, we shall extract the spirits of the heroes and those simpletons! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「O, Osu!!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m hungry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have no good reason to fight the princess or Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s all about my own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just my feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I still don’t want to lose! I’ll win!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『All right, then rest and we shall start tomorrow…is what I would like to say, but we will begin the day after tomorrow. Take a day off tomorrow.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Os-… Eh? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, starting tomorrow, more than ever… I was fired up, but the unexpected words uttered by Tre’ainar betrayed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? From tomorrow, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are now under the influence of the magic remodeling and the fatigue that ensues. Physically and mentally. Overwork is counterproductive. Taking time to rest is good for training.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, no, but…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I understand your impatience. The feeling of ‘your will’ is sufficiently transmitted. Tis why you can rest your body and mind, that you may be fully prepared to train. Is that good? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar is really saying, ‘It’s not just reckless training’, I get it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Is it also training to rest the body?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m pretty tired with ladders, sparring and 【Vier】. It’s counterproductive to do more training in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I thought, how amazing, this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re looking out for me a lot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A-And that is why… child. Tomorrow you will rest…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『S-Speaking of which, is it not about time? You know, as aforementioned… Umm, just that…… not? Tis not arrived…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Things like, Tre’ainar looking away while crossing his arms, and glancing at me, seeming restless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s going on all of a sudden? About time? Arrived?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh~…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… you, can’t read the novel since you’re dead… the one you asked for at the bookstore, the arrival day…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, oooh, tis so. Tis so! Mmmm! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey…… This guy… certainly not?! I’m taking a day off, just so he can read…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What, why that look?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that a bulls-eye?! Seriously, this guy! …… No……It’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「True, that’s right. Well then…… tomorrow let’s be carefree and read.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Heh!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s okay. I’m really indebted to him… If this much is enough for a thank you,…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kokukoku! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m happy. Somehow, the tension I felt suddenly loosened up, and in a good way, I felt a little better.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
