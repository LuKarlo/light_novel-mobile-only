 The reconstruction of this cacletail continues, with the instructions of Princess Fiancei, as well as the help of an Imperial fact-finding team that her husband had kept waiting nearby.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless, the damage done by this country will be immeasurable and, above all, there will be a great sense of loss and anxiety over the loss of the base of Mr. Kron and his heart, Mr. Yamidireh.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 In a situation where the adults are busy with reconstruction work and can't get up too well for the kids, Amae is silently jumping the rope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's what adults use for training at the dojo, but it's not weird because it can also be used as a play tool for children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the jumping Amae is a very serious face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Amae, are you taking this too seriously?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's going on? Something's happened since I got back..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kalui and Tsukushi are also smiling bitterly. T r ansl a t e d by jpmtl.ｃ oｍ

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Amae was sent to Cacletail by Prince Sky a few days ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've heard a great deal about what happened from the Prince of Sky, who has already returned to the Sky World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That the boys, they let out their husbands and wives.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard that story, I laughed carelessly but unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you fight, you'll still have the most powerful husband and wife in the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, there must have been advice there from the Prince, Master Kron, and above all from that hateful Great Demon King, but still, when I heard that Boy flirted with his husband and his wife with foot judgment and made them buttcake, I accidentally held my fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My chest has beeped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I'm convinced that with your strength now, Boy, that's possible too, as long as the conditions are in place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that was a few days ago... and to Amae, who came back...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I promised it would get better. Ouch, Goddess, Grand Cleric, Bro also said that when Amae got better, it would depend. That's why it gets better, you and Kalui, you know, yah! I'm gonna jump on this, and I'm gonna be like you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words to persuade Amae who chased the boys...... but when I heard that story, I thought it applied to me too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, Amae's right"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 No, I deplored my powerlessness in the battle a few days ago, not just for myself... but for all those in this country now, it seems.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Macho strokes Amae's head and gets a big nod.

 Of course, Tukshi and Motriage are smiling and raising their voices while removing debris.

 As we respond to it, so do the people in the dojo and the others...

 The princess seemed dazzled and squealed at this sight as it seemed complicated somewhere.

 "" Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, when me and the princess looked back at the voice called from behind, there was Rival, who was pouring a lot of sweat and overflowing the steam from her body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rival, you've been doing debris removal work all yesterday, so I thought you ordered rest today, huh?... were you even doing unscrupulous special training?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Labored? You know we couldn't work anything in that fight, Fiancei..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rival......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps this is the first wall the Sons of the Seven Braves, called Prodigies, face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, he had grown into a smoother sail than Boy, for Princess, Rival and Foo...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yesterday, I found the training equipment used in the dojo and dojo from under the rubble, and it looks like I can train muscles and stuff under the blue sky, so I tried it in the morning too. It seems like all the tools I've seen for the first time are interesting and the numbers come out according to each force."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Numbers?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. And as I did, I tried everything I could... and I asked the dojo people, and it seemed that all the numbers I put out were far below ground"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, Dojo training equipment was like that kind of magic item.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Macho's power, Kalui's speed, Yamidilee's eyes, and other numbers of people specialized in one area were no match for Bo, but you said the overall and balance skills were very good for that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, even if it doesn't come out numerically, that match in front of you... and now that I've learned so much about the difference in power in the fight against Paris... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rival......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know what's missing... how do I stretch that... even if I stretch it to the tunnel, can I keep up with the ground that makes me stronger at that rate of growth..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Probably the first time anyone has heard of it. Rival, give me your weak voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, no... Ben Chi Pu, what is that? It's not a number at all."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... hoo..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Try the princess later. Really... you'll see how amazing the earth numbers are as soon as you try."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Hu was also returned with a tired look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And like Mr. Rival, the look on his face doesn't float.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Princess... we... how can we be stronger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I guess I'll just have to ask my dads to put on an archery... but they seem busy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I guess so... it was a long time ago when my father put on an archery of spears too..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why the Academy teacher... even with guidance from an Imperial Warrior instructor... this way of saying it would be busy... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one can deny Mr. Foo's words. Because it's what everyone thinks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, I think so, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The effort of the tunnel is natural... but even if we move on to the tunnel, now we're on Earth... not to mention I don't think we can reach a hell of a level of six heaps..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For once, even I, with the power of a senior warrior as a qualification, had no hands or feet in that parippi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was thinking too. To catch up with me, we still really need someone's guidance, too. Father, Lord Hiiro, Lord Maam, Lord Rybar, Lord Benlinaf... Lord Mikado... but everyone will be busy now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hope to be stronger than I am now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we don't know what to do to be strong about the trouble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the meantime, Lord Hiiro and Lord Maam will be back here again soon. Why don't we talk about it then?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But Mr. Hiiro is the busiest... no, he's been skipped a lot right now for a ground search..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But it is not so in this world, such as the Seven Brave Men and the Six Champions, who are free enough to give us guidance."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's certainly best to talk to your husband... no... what do you think?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what to say, but I was wondering if your husband's senses and talents are very helpful... so is your boy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We hadn't noticed anything until this moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Bo and Kron had forgotten something terrible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Way over us lost without knowing how to go down the road...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow... I'm tired of scattering. It's like Hilua's gonna play more on the ground... no, I'm just gonna go home."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant dragon was stretching.
