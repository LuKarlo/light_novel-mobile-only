 For me to not be good with people, you were the only people I could call friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Ground. I've always been jealous of you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hu is the best wizard in the world! Rival is the best swordsman in the world! Fiancei is for the best spear man in the world! And I'm going to be the most powerful ultra brave man in the world beyond my father!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You pulled us, and you were always at our center.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fiancée I admired, too, I've been watching you, not me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was strong, bright, and jealous of you for being honest with my emotions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to be the man you can't beat. I didn't want to lose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr a nsla te d by ｊp ｍtl .c o m That is why I have waved my sword from a young age with hundreds and tens of millions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My hand skin ripped, my mame crushed, and still I've been waving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I didn't want you guys to leave me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But not long after enrolling in the Academy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Oh, oh, Rival beat Earth in a mock fight!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Rival beat Earth, who is also the son of the brave Hiiro!

 No, it wasn't just me.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fiancei in overall strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the field of magic, Hoo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone has outdone you in every realm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Probably since that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We're slowly starting to distance ourselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hey, Earth, Rival, Princess, let's have dinner together ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a hoo to hold between us, so I never got completely alienated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, we couldn't be like we used to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Study abroad? You and Hoo... well... well, good luck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Oh. Earth... I'm coming home stronger...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Ha, isn't that enough twee now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toothpicked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also felt irritated by the loving laughter and the earth getting somewhere and in a sloppy manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T rans l a t e d by jp ｍ tl.c o m I also had feelings for my fiancee, and my complicated thoughts didn't disappear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With those thoughts in mind, at my place of study, I was able to experience more growth by meeting powerful men and warriors from other countries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes, he was driven out by the crisis in the country and was able to defeat the attacking dragon at the end of a death fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That gave me absolute confidence in my power, along with the title of Dragon Slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not like I was just chasing after the earth anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm getting stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt confident that I could share my thoughts with Fiancei.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Battled and beaten against Earth in the match before you...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no earth suffering, no protection from the voices of others...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there were no hands, no legs, nothing to help the enemies that Earth was fighting when he flew out of the country...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not like we were chasing Earth? It is not. Earth has already gone far beyond my sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no lie in the words sworn in the sky world, the words "Let it be the power of Earth one day". But to accomplish that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... d... dragon? Hey, what a huge..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huge dragons flying over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I saw it, my whole body shook up. T r an sl at ed b y jp mtl.co m

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what... this... is so boring..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's nothing. It's not hostile or murderous towards us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if merely being there constricted and feared the whole body, and if even slightly touched the inverse scale of the arr, every human being on this occasion would die... I understood that just by looking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what, what are you doing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What the hell..."

 "Colour.................."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not the only one. Fiancei, Sadis, Hu, and a man named Macho, who seems to be a powerful man, must have felt it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A six-human parippi that was overwhelmingly strong among the battles we have ever fought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far surpasses that parippi...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, did you find it... the crockery, the potatoes and the chickens open their mouths... no? Oh... ho..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dragon noticed our gaze, and I laughed at my mouth wondering if I'd seen this one.
</div>

 Over here...... ugh!?

 Dragons descending suddenly. I'm not a fighter or anything of that dimension.

 At least buy me a few seconds.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Hmm... ho... Hmm. This smell... so much... I thought my blood muscles were extinct by my friends..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dragon descended as it sounded and stood in the ruined city, with a smile somewhere delightful as it looked down at us with its giant... who...

 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watching Thaddess... watching?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somewhere happy, and with a nostalgic eye...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We met a few days ago, my friend's apprentice... and his daughter-in-law... that's not all I was interested in, but I finally got interested in exposing my soul... Nuwahahaha, the descendants of the ahem are still special. I'm a woman, too."

 "Um... oh, what the hell are you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, I'm" Basara, Dragon King of the Underworld. "A rival of the brave woman Kaguya, a distant ancestor. Nuwahahahahahaha"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Don't you know that face? Well, it's a long time ago. Nevertheless, it is only because of that that... that I did not participate in the war between mankind and the Demon King's Army..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meng...... ku? Dragon King of the Underworld? No...... hmm? No, no, Bassara? No, no, no...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey Rival, hoo... I just heard a huge fantasy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me, too. I heard the name in the picture book... and Sadis' ancestors..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither Fiancei nor Hu...... apparently not my misheard......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when they give me such a fairytale name, I take it upon myself to understand that if this dragon is to be named that, it must be real.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So much for this dragon...

 I don't know what's happening to us anymore.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadis, who would have guessed some circumstances, is also holding his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm me, and I only know two things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I can't name myself Dragon Slayer or anything anymore. I wish I had seen so many real dragons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And one more thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This wasn't even explained to me, but I wondered why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The realm where these dragons exist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's probably the view that Earth is aiming for and trying to see right now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
