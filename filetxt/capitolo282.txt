 Honey was relieving the obsession that had occurred from her mistake with Princess Fiancei.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think that's a good thing. It's sad for me that Honey is hanging out with childhood taming. There will be fewer people to invite to weddings in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Thaddes doesn't even accompany Honey on his journey after all. I think that's already good from the bottom of my heart. Honey is a boy, too. Because I don't have to be contacted by sadistic opiates.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so far, Mr. Kron, who would be the biggest competitor in my history, left this country with Honey but then acted differently... I'm so glad... no, really.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So the women who admire Honey all sorts of things got busy, but that there are currently no women to accompany Honey in the progression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, now is a good time... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why?! Space-Time Ninja won't activate!?

 Maximum difficulty in twisting and jumping space to the marked person. T ransla te d b y ｊp ｍt l.co ｍ

 The art of being able to jump to Honey anytime, anywhere, anytime.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using this, supporting Honey from the shadows, and keeping an eye on each and every one of those pitches, would have disintegrated my maneuver as quickly as possible, thinking one step ahead of the other rivals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No way...... something on Honey's body?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The worst thing you can think of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No... I don't like that... honey... you... what do we do with our kids?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Then there are other possible reasons… the inability to activate surgery will mean my lack of strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that's most likely...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Huh... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I had goosebumps all over my body in the fierce compression I feel from a remote place...... hey!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what, oh, what are you talking about?!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant dragon is in the city... not good!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Please, in time!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized it, I was rushing out. But I can tell at this distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever you think, you're not the one who can handle it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's stronger than everyone I've ever met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Basara the Dragon King of the Underworld! You can call me whatever you want, little one, okay?

 "... and yes, yes, yes!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dragon opened its mouth and solidified to Amae's words that sparkled her innocent eyes, and the people around her were Zuckered out, and I stuck my head off to the ground in front of Amae too...

 "Ah, it's Synob..."

 "Ah, uh... ahhh..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amae called it "Bar" against a dragon whose name appeared in the myth by legend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kind of blew up a lot, too, and with a little bit of odeco, I didn't say a word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my little one. There won't be a bar! I'm a male!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shh, wow... maybe if this dragon even blows his nose right now, everyone on this scene will die... and yet Amae instead of having a fear, nico...

 And I don't know if it's real or not, but it seems not surprising that the Penitentiary Dragon King is just the compromise... well, that's Honey and my sister... oh, that's horrible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, Amae, I don't know if it's dangerous anymore!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Anyway, if Amae is too defenseless, before the dragon so that everyone protects Amae at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless, I got up, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...

 Words that totally look down on us and mock us.

 "Hmm?"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when Mr. Thaddes asked about the dragon...

 "Basara, the Dragon King of the Underworld... that... called you... do you mean Bo Ma and Mr. Kron?

 Why Honey the Dragon King of the Underworld!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that Earth is a summons!?

 "Liar, Earth can't use summoning magic..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And besides, he said it was a summons to the Dragon King of the Underworld!? Rather than that, that Kaba really belongs to the Dragon King of the Underworld..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honey's childhood friends, the princesses, can't hide their surprises.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, you surprise me so far. Oh, my God, the boulders are honey.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But... Honey's daughter-in-law--

 "Ugh, ba-kun! Amae is going to get better! It's unbelievable!

 Hey, so Amae!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blow your cheeks up, sweetie, but what are you doing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not very stimulating......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Good luck with the dressing."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the dragon laughs lavishly at Amae's words...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In a way, you're probably the most likely one. The age of a human being... is a time when the nervous system known as" Golden Age "develops significantly... which means that the way you spend this time will have a significant impact on your future ability."

 Back to back with that luxury, I said something that didn't fit theoretically... but I turned my face uncomfortably along the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm pretty sure it's a dragon that's changed a lot.
