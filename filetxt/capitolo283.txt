 Nodding to Trayna's words beside me, I concentrate my consciousness on the bait attached to the needle in the dripping yarn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fish swimming around...... align with the movement, and prepend, and the moment the fish puts the bait in sight, it's as if inviting. I move my wrist gently chong-chong to make it look as if the bait is alive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, it took.

 It doesn't make sense if you just activate the radar. It doesn't make sense if you have to be able to activate naturally while fighting in battle.

 So, do something else, but also activate the radar on it. That's the onboard workout Trayna gave me.

 Sure, if I had been spoiled by Sadis as I used to be... I appreciate Sadis, and I've always liked him... and Trayna's right, maybe that would have made me happy.

 But I might not have had the pleasure of grabbing raw fish like this and getting a sense of accomplishment.

 And I was just obsessed with the story, and I was called by Espi from behind.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Obviously not fishing, I must have caught bacon with my abilities, and when I asked with my jito eyes, Espi lied about finding out while swimming his eyes hard.
