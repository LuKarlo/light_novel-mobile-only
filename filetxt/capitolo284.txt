 "You worked out in Cacletail by training and advising with the motorists. Well, it's only been a few months, so I'm halfway through it, but still there's always got to have been something I could see from a position where I could just work out the rest of the time, by being in a position to work out the others'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was convinced that that was indeed the case with the words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a position to send advice, I felt quite responsible, and I couldn't say anything tedious, so I seriously confronted their movements and powers to identify the characteristics of Motriage, Oratsuki, Mobna and Budeo.

 At that time, Osama the sailors spoke to me and Espi, who were sitting on the deck opposite each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ouch. I'm going to catch these deckerfish."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's a promising future, young lady."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi used his abilities, but Osama and the others who didn't know about it said they fished with their abilities... well, in a way, their abilities are also their abilities, but in any case, they were shining their eyes as they looked at the octopus that Espi captured.

 "Oh... 'Lord of the Near Seas' could catch it too"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Lord??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the course of that story, Osama and the others uttered something of some concern.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lord? Is that what's going on around here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a story I didn't hear at all when I was on the boat to go, so I was a little interested, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. Say 'Sea King Squid'... he's a famous monster among sailors. It's a ferocious creature that's said to have sunk many fishing boats and even warships."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes...... squid?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. I don't know when and where he'll show up at the shrine, and few of them have said they've seen it, but it definitely exists. There's a lot of bounty on that evidence, and a lot of hunters are still looking for it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh... Crazy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So this ship is equipped with artillery and everything. Well, it's simply an antidote to the Demon King's army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just in case you ask how Trayna next door is...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Yeah, I've heard that there was such an organism, but I've never seen any more, and I've heard rumors that someone else did it when I realized it...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Is that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, I guess we haven't been tailored yet at this time of our time...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... unexpectedly, I'm behind it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Huh, I can't say what...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was just kidding, because Trayna grumbled so seriously unexpectedly, I also thought, "No way..." but I also thought, "No way."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, I've made up my mind!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi suddenly stood up and squeezed his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll catch him!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then, now it's time... come on! Brother, fight again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is more of a temper, even though it's like having fear if you're a normal person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I'm the Seven Braves, and I'm single and I'm powerful enough to challenge six champions, so can't I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is surprisingly what really put that squid in place...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oooh, there's something huge floating ahead of you - -!!!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, suddenly the wild voice of someone on the sailor sounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know! But look at that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ugh, whats that!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sailors rushed to the bow and me and Espi followed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we saw it, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh... there's something there, brother"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh... it's decadent... what is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huge objects floating in the sea ahead. I can see that from a distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's quite decadent to know that even at this distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe more than this ship...?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... huge... head and foot..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Exactly now we were talking...'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Bye...... '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unexpectedly, I get myself out too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, take a tentacle of something... I feel like I see a few of those...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just that I'm most concerned...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's... already..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhm... you're dead"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew it. A mysterious object floating in the ocean... No, the organism is already dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The carcass is floating in the ocean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what's all that huge stuff...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Wait, take a look. Near that carcass... there's a boat... there's someone on board, isn't there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna tells me, I'll take a closer look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, there's certainly one boat floating around... but who, and what kind of guy, doesn't look clear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I and Trayna will soon find out who the hell that is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in a way, what I'm going to grow up to...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi wasn't the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
