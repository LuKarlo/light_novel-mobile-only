 Bigger squid than a ship. That's exactly the monster.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's also a convincing decathlon to be seen as dangerous and bountiful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the problem is that the monster is dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And you're not just dead.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the ship approached Sole, the situation…

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 The head of what appears to be a giant squid...... is crushed as if it was slapped with something giant, many of its legs carved and smashed.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 The sailors also realize its existence and at the same time raise their voices of surprise.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I accidentally lost my temper.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Silence. As the child looks back at us and remains silent, we also lose our words and a heavy air flows through the field.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then he notices us, and even though it's in his sight, he doesn't seem to care if he's not showing interest, he just sees it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up... your breath stinks too... Zorro, don't show up and call me... you want to piss me off?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh... that's pretty pointy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, the adults have not uttered any such words about the child as "businesslike" or "annoying".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is a mysterious and creepy child who stands beside the carcass of a large monster thought to be the Lord of the Offshore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's impossible to be swallowed up by the difference...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhhh!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so only Espi shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as I point to the monster's carcass and tremble...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's... that's a dickhead iow or something squid...?

 "... well, yeah... is there a problem?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child answers Espi's question with an unchallenged voice, but Espi bites his teeth remorsefully at the words.

 "That's what I was supposed to bust... your brother was busting me... uhh, I was supposed to bust you no!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That way!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And everyone would have thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed bigger to Espi that the kid felt his prey had been taken aside than he had defeated a big monster, and he wasted it on the deck puncturing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the child sighed at Espi's words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You? Phew... oh man. You're a loud, retarded girl."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?... now... what did you say? About me...... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're not only retarded by your head, but also by your ears."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ooh, Espi's cheeks are puckoo swollen and candied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come here, don't"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Because, brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, yes, all right, all right."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at this point, I thought,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see, I was wondering if the encounter and the first impression sucked...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, kid! You did this, didn't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Can't you just see it? You're grown-ups and you're retarded."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Will you go now because I'm in your way? I have to cut where I need to go to prove the crusade is complete."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, wait! Hey, who are you!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And to that inquiry of the sailor Osama, the child sighed once small......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm 'Slaya'. Hunter."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew it. Me and Trayna laughed bitterly at each other when we heard the name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sh, Slaya, ah, that rumored genius boy!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "They say Iron Heart, Prodigy... is that Slaya!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, a startling voice rose from the surroundings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like you were a celebrity in this day and age.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha... hey, Slaya! What if I put that in brackets on this ship? If you've planted such a decked-ocean king squid, show them the harbor!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm? You want to sell me a favor and spill my bounty? You're a humble adult."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no, that's not what I meant..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, but... then... I'll cut it off and splash it with all sorts of things and my body won't stink... I guess I'll have it do that. How much money do you want?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, yeah. He said he didn't want any money! And I'd rather show it to everyone in the harbor..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't do anything to get spills from other people. I don't even make borrowing. That's all."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, he's got that attitude toward everybody.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cold answer to sailor Osama's query as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the other person is an adult, he hits the tough word straight. There wasn't a word of reverence or respect for the elderly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know, just now the language isn't the kid's sole...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you don't have enough respect..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, yes, I'm sonking my master... though..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Leaving aside the exchange in my mind, well, does it make any difference that he's a busy kid in any case?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time, I know he was amazing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you the manager..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhm......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I only zackled Traina about his background in the future, but it's still different to actually see it this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, how did you defeat such a big monster with such a small body...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew... Ok..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Slaya jumps on the boat with a story to tell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When you stand in the same space in this way, you can see that you are releasing even more unique air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Espi roaring with his teeth out on Slaya as he clung to my feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh man, sweet to my family like a child... selfishly angry... you're such an embarrassment"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Espi and you are children...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh!? I'm not ashamed of you! It's okay because I'm close to your brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bullshit... don't stare at me if you don't need me. I didn't mean to."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ko, ko, kon, ooh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stop!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gu, oh, brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was an espi that still seemed pretty and tremendous, but I grabbed it and stopped it before that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also got a headache in Espi trying to get my legs bummed and rammed while he grabbed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn... so calm down... and you too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. Not really... don't be cold on women, eh? To the woman...... yasashikshiro"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, it was a word I casually intended to say, but I myself feel a bit subtle about things here lately... like Thaddess, the princess...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, Boomerang!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna stumbled in with a knoll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But against me like that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I wonder what to say..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya laughed with her nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not interested in other people. I'm not willing to let anyone through. Fighting alone and living alone... I don't want to be preached by someone spoiling each other and hella"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you... those words, where and by whom are you teaching them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Slaya turned her heels back with cold eyes and went over with Stasta.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You've been so intrigued by me in the future, or so obsessed with Currie... you change people...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if you say it changes...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, nah, that boy! I'm a skank, and I don't speak well! And it's dark! Me...... oh boy, about big! Beh! Eh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, these two will later be lovers to each other, and in a decade or so they may be currently married...... and I want to scratch in, but since it's just me and Traina who know that, I decided to keep that in my chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
