 Espi was angry at Slaya's pointy attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was just wondering how we'd become lovers from such an encounter, but Espi got in a bad mood anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered how I could forgive you, but that was surprisingly easy.

 The dining room on board.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Spacious spaces, including not only sailors, but also passengers like us for travel, are busy enjoying meals and drinking and making noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that, Espi was nicotine cheeky with a small mouth full of seafood dishes on a plate from next to next.

 I don't know, do sea men like to behave like meshi?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that's what happened at the fishing port.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But unlike then, now I'm left alone because I see Espi eating purely smiling and puckering, dusty sea men feeding me one mesh after another. T r a n s l a t ed by jpｍ tl.coｍ

 Well, I hope Espi's in a better mood.

 And...

 - You never had a cake?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can eat more delicious things.

 If you smile at that and tell me it's delicious, that's all I need.

 So I guess Espi is looking good.

 When I had a seizure, I was pretty thrilled about the original power sucking.

 On the other hand...

 "Well... is he here..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We just met, a long time ago the pointy kid isn't in the dining room.

 Have you finished eating the meshi first?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is being entertained by all kinds of adults, and he looks like he's having fun, so why don't you just leave it there and go check on him for a second? I'm worried.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a surprise.

 I did myself wonder why for a moment Trayna told me, but the reason was simple.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Brother!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is really open to me right now. He trusts me. Maybe it's because I know you admire me.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't even think of him as someone else anymore.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Because I'm not married. Because I didn't do the wedding. So, I don't even have kids. Not until we get permission from each other's families for the marriage and the wedding.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna seems to have laughed and convinced me what I think.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. You're gonna be my sister's future wedding partner, aren't you? Then you know exactly what he's like... and if he's a jerk,... Kuhaha, I don't know."

 If you were a jerk, wouldn't you allow marriage? I'm not even that big of a guy myself, and I don't mean to be sarcastic.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But instead of forgiving me, I thought I didn't know what that Slayer was or what it was like.

 "Hmm!? Well, he's actually older... and I have people who might marry him in the future, like Kron, Sinob, Sadis, and so on!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I think the princess is definitely beautiful and a good woman. But nah - it was just childhood tampering, it was too long being a tankob over my eyes, something I realized as not much of a woman... I think I was a little terrible around there too... and with that in mind, I was right after I opened the dining room door trying to find him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was perfect.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I opened the door, there was that kid... Slaya standing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the other one slipped away from me right away with no expression on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey."

 "Meshi, you're here to eat, aren't you? Let's go."

 "I'm not going in. It sounds loud now."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, my God, I was trying to get back on my heels without going in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it's loud? Well, sure, now that everyone's focused on espi and Osama and the others have been drinking, it's loud when it comes to loud.

 But that's all you care about?

 "Well, I don't like the noise during meals... and the crowds in my eyes..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although it is faceless, I can see that only its eyes seem grumpy.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, how old is this guy?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, don't talk to me. I don't want to be with the idiots."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 And right after I said whatever I wanted, I could hear my little belly sound coming from right in front of me, but Slaya went with Stasta as fast as she could.

 "Shh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what else to do, but I can't just leave the hungry kid like that, and I decided to go after him.

 "That's what you bought at the modern Akiko's, right? The rest of us devised a portable meal. '

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Currie in the camp, or in the city, eating cake for espi, still sleeping in my bag without a turn, an example alle that Trayna was once said to have devised.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, although I bought it in his shop in modern times, I hadn't eaten it yet either.
