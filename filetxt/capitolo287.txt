 Once on deck, the hot daytime sun is cold as a lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I looked up, there were so many stars shining in the sky, so beautiful that I could have accidentally spotted them.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I found him.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... why are you here..."

 "But what's the point of standing at such a high place and seeing it?

 What are you doing?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... man... shut up... talking to yourself? You... just now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If me and Traina were looking up on the deck, he'd come down and look at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Apparently, the latter... you didn't want anyone in your way...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn... in this day and age... the kid is fine and he wants to see people with his eyes..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was about that guy or Espi... you said something about being an ultra brave guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared to me like that, I wonder what kind of life a child could have a face like that. Tr a n s l ate d by jpm t l.ｃo m
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, wow, get out of my way. I just wanted to talk to you... and tell you something about you... so I thought you might be interested in me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Answering Slaya, who asked in a grumpy manner, Slaya looked at me even more grumpy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even though the kid who I can't even imagine living a life and seems to have started looking at me like that is the other guy, I still don't feel good about being stared at like that forever either, so I'm going to tease him a little...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me? Interested in you? I'm proud of myself."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical Parcool!"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ugh!!???
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as soon as he sighed and his gaze came off of me only for a moment, I ran up the mast with a little real parcool and circled behind him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "............... you are..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops, that's a good reaction...... but when you get away with being so freaked out, your brother gets a little hurt, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya, who blinded herself halfway to my movement, jumped away in an instant to the edge of the mast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. That's a good reaction to the kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is somewhat of the type who uses his abilities to move, but is this guy here with his vegan physical abilities?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the moment, I'm standing guard, staring seriously at me so that I can move out at any time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tra ns lated b y Jpm t l.ｃ o ｍ "So, what do you say? Did you have any interest in me?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, don't stare. I'm not taking anything else to eat. Rather..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya, who had ever taken an attitude of rejection towards anyone and didn't even try to be interested, finally looked at me, though in a bad way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it could start a fight like this, so I laughed and showed him that there was no hostility. Then I took the arrow out of my pocket and threw it at Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, I'm sorry I surprised you. So you don't have to think that you gave me this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya caught something thrown by me while I was on guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll take the same thing out of my other pocket and break that bag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what came out of it was a little bar-shaped biscuit - some food.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... is this...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're a hunter, but you don't know?" Calorie Friend. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, a portable meal purchased at a tool shop run by modern Slaya, once conceived by Trayna and possessed by Demon King soldiers as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not suspicious, I gave it a try.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I could be the first...

 'Hmm!? What are you complaining about? This is quite trial-and-error and ingenious on the flavor -'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, but fluffy... the flavor creaks in... yeah, good enough"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well...... it will be. By the way, it's crunchy because it keeps moisture down. Because it's low in moisture, it's light and convenient for your phone.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I thought I'd be in a bad mood for a second, Trayna, but I'm happily nodding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't worry, I'm a woman these days, I'm little ones, I'm a master, I'm all sorts of things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what... you... who? For what purpose do you approach me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't get up like that. I'm in so much trouble for my money that I want to make a profit on you."

 "I mean, he said it's stupid to ask people twice, but you can tell me that after you don't ask questions twice either."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I told you. I was interested in you, so I thought I'd talk to you for a second."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The same alert slayer without stripping off the bag of calorie friends I gave her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't want to flock with anyone."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, well.... So, how did you take down that big squid during the day? Magic?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh-huh... Unlike Espi and his master, this one has a strong guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, I'll give you back this portable meal."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, that's because it was done to you, or because it's a piece of cake. You're hungry, aren't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not decreasing! And I don't want it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Slaya tried to return her calorie friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as I'm concerned, you don't have to give it back, but Slaya's stubborn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you refuse that much?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but I was also a kid when Saddis said, "You can't get sweets or anything from people you don't know. I'll be kidnapped," he said, "and you mean you can't take it from a dubious guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, I don't want it! So...... give it back!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the figure of Slaya, who was in front of him, shook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You must be flying fast and trying to get around behind me. Was it pretty annoying that they took the back just now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... he said I didn't have to give it back"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh... Huh...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried to land behind me. I went around further behind Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya solidified as she held me back and stuck out her calorie friend who was trying to give me back in a space of nothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... or... give it back!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said, "I don't need it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With regret, Slaya looks back and mumbles and tries to poke her calorie friend hard at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the hand cut the sky again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sorry to hear that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, are you... the hell..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya, who can't even touch me, has stared at me with her eyes wide open, but those eyes are not the same as those that were indifferent to me "not interested in anything" anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those eyes are obviously like, "Who are you?" He asks. I'm wondering who I am. In a way, can I assume you're interested?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I thought I'd play with this some more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Slaya... if you regret it... why don't you grab me and give him back to me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Taunt Slaya for not being able to touch me... that's exactly...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? You're a hunter, but can't you get a human?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than hunting......, it's a mess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Slaya, who should have had the attitude of not being interested in or willing to be involved with anyone, also has this provocation...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh... I don't know who you are... but are you looking at me sweetly enough to stand up a little? Then... I'll catch you soon and let you know! Don't fuck with me!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He rode me easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ha ha, you're still a kid. Riding an easy provocation is a choke, isn't it? Hey, kid.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'You say that?! Yes, Boomera - -'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No, it's nothing...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Not at all... but... it's something to be aware of, even though it's a child's mess, because it's pretty thrilling...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Oh, I know. I don't even know what he's capable of. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I came to talk to you and thought I'd find out a little about Slaya... this in a way... or maybe this is better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Same as when I was in Koziloh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, look, you got him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait, I won't let you get away with it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like we can know each other better than we can force ourselves to talk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, I jumped off the mast, ran off on the deck, and then Slaya came after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
