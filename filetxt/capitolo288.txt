<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Uhm. It is an application capable of collecting substances in the air by magic to create iron, freely changing their shape, making them weapons, shields, etc. and fighting them... it requires a lot of precision, so it is obsolete with no more users...'

 "Heh, you have such handy magic!

 'Mm-hmm. And there was a point. That Great Sea King during the day...... he had been tragically killed in battle, but it was like he was hit with a giant sword, hammer, etc. not magic etc...... I mean, I guess that's what it is'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant sword appeared in that hand of Slaya while she was listening to Trayna's explanation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far bigger than a child's slayer, it would be a place for a large sword against a large organism.

 When I say it like that, it doesn't seem like a full slayer.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll tell you. The daytime squid broke both ways with this sword. If you don't want to meet the same eye, you think you should surrender now, huh? I'm a hunter. Hunting or being hunted is part of my life, and a hella like you will always be..."
