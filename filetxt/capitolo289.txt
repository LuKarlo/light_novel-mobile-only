 "Fuck you, Great Shining Starlight Shower!!

 Slaya trying to stop me from moving by throwing a knife while I say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think you should throw the blade lightly at people, but it's what I provoked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But either way, it doesn't extend to the Knei of Sinob. Maybe this guy's not used to knife-throwing fights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nice naming sense, but you're so good at knife throwing. I mean, it was more of a threat to be chasing people, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, shut up! Then how about this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya is working on her magic again with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now what kind of weapon? T ra n s l a t e d b y jp ｍ tl .co m

 "Come on Ultra Hyper Darkness Meteor Strike!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then a giant spiney iron sphere appeared in Slaya's hand, bracketed in chains at the end of the pattern.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is the first sword-like supine to be served against giant organisms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, Morningstar... it's a pretty odd sight for a kid to wield an array"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, it was only in my father's arsenal, but when you were a kid, you didn't even look at that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, you're still a kid... with a sense of naming..."
</div>

 "....................................... Enough, Nothing"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and Trayna laugh bitterly that I created a pretty maniacal weapon for a kid, but I sure wouldn't be stylish if I hit it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya swung it with a centrifugal force full of force, and a sumptuous wind-cut sound echoed across the deck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't break the ship, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're saying shut up! Yes! Hit it! Hit it!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn... so what are you gonna do about swinging something heavy like that... you can't even hit it if you're aware of the time"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya wields her weapon with momentum that blows everything around her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But because of his huge weapon, he doesn't seem to be able to use it while running himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, from the length of the chain, I can largely tell the difference, so I won't even hit it if I take a distance... so... without knowing it, Slaya is selflessly obsessed with swinging weapons... not that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's what you're looking at right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya's eyes are obviously aimed at something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I know. I can't believe I made it... I'm not gonna be Ate in front of his magic... right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T r a ns la te d b y jp m tl .co m 'Hehe, yeah. Haven't you been able to afford it gradually since you mastered the radar? Well, I guess my battle with Koziloh turned out to be a big experience.'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna's right, I'm not licking Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I'm nervous. I'm calm, too, because I know what he's going to do next.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Slaya's magic is iron making. I mean...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, the number of Morningstar chains that Slaya was wielding grew and the time grew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he's building his own weapon, so he can change its shape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, you can extend the weapon's interval during use.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no... this too..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let me think you won't hit me if you're out of time, stretch your time and attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was also able to deal with that calmly because I had read it in advance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shh... again... so... dumb me again... haha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tra n s l ate d by ｊp ｍ tl.ｃoｍ I guess Slaya was pretty confident about that too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike earlier, I'm not frustrated and flying right up to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His breath is disturbed, and on top of that, out of confusion and shock, he's stood up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'm not fooling around. You're awesome."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why I'm seriously trying to concentrate and identify it, thinking I shouldn't be alarmed, too. That's why I was able to avoid it now. You... I guess you're still going to be strong..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ".....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But so am I. I can't beat you yet, and I'll still be strong."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... um, uh... ho, are you complimenting me? Which is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though confused and shocked, Slaya seemed somewhat less than full of my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You look a little lit up, and I'm about to laugh unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think of Slaya like that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aren't you and I pretty awesome? That's what I mean. So you have to admit something about me, too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was one step closer and had my hands on its head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ra ns l ate d by ｊpｍ tl.com Like I've ever done to Amae and Espi against a slayer of kids who hate to lose and are mean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't treat me like a child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, oh, my God, Wally Wally. It's a boy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, unlike Amae and Espi, Slaya doesn't seem happy to be able to stroke her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He complained with his lips pointy as if he were a little stubborn, and... ah... this guy asked me how I was getting closer...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had stretched his arm to catch me, but I had detected the motion beforehand, so I avoided it without difficulty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, no alarm, no gap."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You were aware that that was a little cowardly right now, and on top of that, the accidental failure made Slaya extra shy to lean over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, then I'll pay you back. Try to dodge my moves."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, get up."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? Your moves......? Huh! What are you doing... come on, if you're coming! Whatever comes, I will never..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed and proclaimed to Slaya, trying to do a little of what I did now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I hear of my moves, Slaya, who was leaning down, looks up haha and finds herself with a tight look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm willing to keep my eyes wide open and see what I can do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm such a slayer...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... The Great Demon See Absolutely"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… …… ... Ah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Take a look in the direction of the day after tomorrow, and also take a look at the slayer attached to it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nothing particularly unusual happened to those facing me, and Slaya leaned her neck for a moment without understanding the translation, but quickly hurried back to the front of her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm not there anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as Slaya's gaze slipped away, I turned around behind Slaya...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Dong."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pounded Slaya's head from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sorry to hear that again."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So what do you say? Slaya became silent and leaned down again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But gradually my shoulders... no, my whole body shuddered...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, oh, no more! Him, coward! For you adults, uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuha, no, no. That's a decent special. This great demon will catch even the six winners of the Demon King's Army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is that supposed to be it! I should get caught up in such a kid...... Hih, hiccup...... no, I got caught... uhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya changed the attitude of the first scurvy, thorny, busty kid, angrily wasting time on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuha, don't be so angry. Told you? That's a decent move..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up! So, more or less, you... if you're not even hungry..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? What, are you still hungry?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh, no, I tend to... the..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, excuses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really don't admit to losing, you're a mean kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, dig a grave and lean down again uncomfortably...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, I'll... calorie friend, you don't have to give it back, eat it and replenish it a little."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... so, my stomach..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, or... don't you dare eat because I can't think of any other excuses if you can't catch me when my stomach's full?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no! I won't lose! Oh, okay, I'll eat! Eat it! Supply it and I'll catch you soon!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, cholo! My provocation finally caused Slaya to strip off her bag of calorie friends and eat them badly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was funny and I was laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu Ha Ha, Aren't Children Mean For Much"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hmm? Really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, but... now you know what Slaya is like."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma-na."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I got a pretty good idea about this slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Conclusion, I'm a kid after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's a genius, promising in the future, and he's not very honest with all kinds of people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I skip geniuses and stuff like that, and I'm like this... I don't hate it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
