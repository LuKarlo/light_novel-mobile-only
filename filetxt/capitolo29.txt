 Tre’ainar has been fidgety all morning long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child. Why the delay? The state of your hair is of no concern to anyone. Cease this imprudent observance of yourself, child. Depart at once.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah …Oh, okay, I’m done. Geez…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hey, make haste already.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A day off on an academy holiday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trained diligently in the morning…… not without motive, we’re going out to the city today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Little man. What happened? Are you all right now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Oh, well. To town for a bit today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is it a date?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my, do stay single as long as possible. Yoyoyo”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was going out, Sadiz made fun of me, but I left the mansion to buy something… or rather, I went to the city to receive it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of the holidays, the commercial district is crowded with people all morning, and people my age were wearing plain clothes and playing and shopping with friends today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some of them look like they’re on a date. Just die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Passing through these people, my goal is the biggest bookstore in the Capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s Young Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hello…” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I arrived at the bookstore, the manager noticed me as he was arranging the lineup of books in front of the store.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you for the patronage this morning. All the books you ordered have arrived. They were mostly old titles, but everything is fine. But was it okay not to deliver them? There’s a fair amount, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s fine. And. I want to see it as soon as possible… No, I wanted to see it sooner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, today I came to pick up the books that I had previously ordered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well then, please wait here. I’ll bring it now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The manager laughed and walked into the store.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar who had been grinning for a long time became even more restless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, finally the sequels to the Destiny series… Also, Dragon Circle, Thousand Piece, and to even resume the epic of Jaeger x Jaeger! During my time, the author went on a hiatus without writing a continuation.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever, Tre’ainar, usually full of dignity, is already running around me like a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Young Earth. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting. I also prepared a small cart to make it easy to carry around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Thank you, Sir!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At laaaaaasstt!!!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If anyone other than me could see Tre’ainar, they would never believe he was the so called ‘Great Demon King’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child! Go to the park right there forthwith! I shall read it before returning to the mansion!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, okay damn.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ha~, what to do! What to do? What do we do? Where do we begin!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha. I wonder if it’s okay. The Demon King’s Eyes Shine on Human Culture.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, as I have said, there are no barriers to culture. Rejecting conventions based on their racial discrepancy is a human trait. Or rather, I refuse to indulge in inelegant matters.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked so happy, Ha~.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then again, maybe it’s not unreasonable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s been trapped alone behind that seal for over 15 years and couldn’t even talk to anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There would have been no entertainment at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve shown him a little bit of the city, but it’s all within the range of my actions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, he saw to my various training routines without fail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this would make him so happy, then, I’m glad I bought it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it that interesting? This book”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A spacious Imperial Capital Central Park.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children playing with large playground equipment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A picnic with families spreading their lunch boxes on the lawn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man and a woman of the same age as me on the bench and she’s giving him a lap pillow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, you should read these as well. The Destiny series is as yet too intricate for children, but would you not find Thousand Piece interesting? Tis the story of a man going on an adventure with his comrades to become the King of the Bandits.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, wait. The Great Demon King was reading the story of the Bandit King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Surely I have said so. There is no racial barrier when it comes to culture.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great…tch, too intricate for me? Everyone takes me lightly, don’t they? Academically I’m better than my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho. In that case, go with the Destiny series!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was close to bursting into laughter, I crossed the park’s spacious lawn, sat down in the shade of a tree in the corner, in an area where there was no distractions or loud voices, and picked up a book.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you want to do? Do you read from the first series? Or do you resume from the continuation you haven’t seen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… the middle… No, may as well! From the start! Read from the beginning! I wish to relive the old days after so long an absence! Or rather, read and then express your impressions later child!』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I lean on the tree and take one of the books and open it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar looks in from over my shoulder, his eyes shimmering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a park with a lot of families and couples, I read with the Great Demon King in the shade of a tree?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regrettably… this, isn’t it really too lovey-dovey?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh, reading a book with the Great Demon King, is this a first in history?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child. Move to the next page!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m still reading! It’s my first time, and I’m not used to reading such books in the first place, so don’t rush!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar isn’t bothered about the surreal situation we’re in, seems he’s really immersed in the book.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I don’t finish reading the page, I can’t move on to the next one, so I have no choice but to go on reading.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right from the start, I was attracted to the story’s setting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It contains some difficult terms, but it can be read normally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The main character is -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child… still?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, next page…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some dubious words from Tre’ainar with a slightly grumpy face over my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? No, I’m still on the page, I’ve only read a few opening lines?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait a minute. It’s my first time, so don’t rush like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, I am aware! But is your reading not it a tad slow? I have already read the first page silently without missing a word five times over!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? So fast!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How fast does this guy want to read? I mean, normally it’s too fast!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, he has read this book before, so it’s natural to be able to read it smoothly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ha, I finally finished reading the first page.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, next.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm………………………………………… Hey, are you on the next page yet?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How in the world!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just turned the page a few seconds ago!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How fast can you read?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t stand Tre’ainar’s pace, so I raised my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar also approached my face with an ogre-like expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are slow to read!! Your pace is sluggish! By the time you finish reading one page, I must have read the same page time and again! Tis frustrating!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nna!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『With so much time spent on a single page… surely it shall require the whole of today to finish reading everything!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? No way, all this, today!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think I’d be complaining about the speed of silent reading when I came here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think I’d read all dozens of books today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just reading one novel, my eyes and head get tired, but you can read it even faster…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Good grief. With our sparring sessions, and also the effects of ladder training, your movement, intuition, prediction, reaction speed and so on are improving… but in the first place, you must also exercise your ‘eye power’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, besides, this rapid reading speed of the Great Demon King is due to those ridiculous Rikudo magic eyes… Hey, if I’m too slow to finish reading, why don’t I just flip to the end without reading it anymore?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be a dullard! Tis a book you bought and paid for. If I read without you reading it, tis as if I am leaning on your charity!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, this is also a thank you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And if you trace the source of the funds, it would be pocket money from the wages that Hiro and Mamu earned by working! Do you mean for me to thank Hiro and Mamu for their charity!? To the end, tis simply a situation in which I merely peek at the book you are reading! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, such a bothersome rejection, you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, we shall train your eyes! At this rate, we can neither discuss the plot in our spare time, nor can we predict future developments together… Also it will be useful in battle!』 [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Just now, you’ve said something like discussing the plot? That’s not what you said!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a break from training today, but it would be better if I could relax…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Is that your motivation!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. I shall train your ‘Dynamic vision’ and ‘Peripheral vision’!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, misleading the matter like that, Tre’ainar forcibly took the conversation in the direction of the training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Magical Speed Reading Training!』 [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He also suggested a strange training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wha-, speed reading training, it can’t be useful in battle!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the end…… it was useful in battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The word used here, ども(dohmo), is very versatile with lots of meanings. But here it simply works as a greeting.
