 The glitch on the deck continued.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though I replenished my energy once with calorie friends, there is no pacing on the slayer that comes after me with all my might from start to now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To this end, sweat is already flowing like a waterfall in Hetoheto.

 'That's right. Steps to predict ahead. In addition, dodge with the minimum movement required for the opponent's movements. Pace allocation. It has never gone beyond the high basic performance of physical abilities, magic and abilities, but it cannot go further. Not only is it gumshallah. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna nodded at my realization, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And what's important is not to think with your head and move like that, but to stain your body so that you can do that naturally if you don't have to think about it and be in battle."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not just about building muscle strength, speed, magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To use your head, so that your body can move that way naturally without having to use your head any time soon.

 Sounds like you still have magic. I also know roughly how much magic he has left on the radar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And unlike swords and spears, this doesn't come with a move that spreads widely.

 He's spreading the iron net wide enough to try to restrain me.

 Well, if you're going to catch a monster or something alive, that's handy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you can use a move like this, you can use it from the beginning... no... if you look closely, the net is quite the size of the hole. Come on, less.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, because the range is big, the magic is diminished.

 I dare not dodge the net, I could easily pull the net off a thousand times.

 Slaya with a skanky face. However, he reluctantly received a calorie friend from me while complaining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He says this, but did he open his heart to me at all? And just what I thought...

 A voice that suddenly echoes on the deck. That's Espi who should have been entertained in the dining room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother! If you think you won't be back all the time...... what are you doing with such a kid!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 And Espi, who found me, ran bright red in his face, forcing himself between Slaya and me, roaring.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Because you're my brother! What are you doing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What are you doing, too!? What did you give him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, no, give me some items..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Leave me alone, what are you doing!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi who somehow "ugly" and emotionally exfoliates and squanders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You look pretty angry at Slaya and me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're a loud kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was just hanging out with this guy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, hey!? Why!? Why would your brother play with a kid like this?!?

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Transl a t e d b y jpｍ t l.ｃo ｍ Espi's anger is at its apex against Slaya, who answers pale in sigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, you're not playing with me! Play with me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, calm down now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He jumped on my chest and Espi yelled many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh boy... I don't know who you are... but you're gonna have a hard time standing in the way of your loud feet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's that!? That's about me!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Mm, mmm, mmm, mmm! Blink!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trying to forgive the roaring espi, I'll pom and stroke his head while holding him, but he's still not going to fit in.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh-huh, the little one thought he'd be back in most of his mood at Nadenade, but wasn't that chocolate...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, we should both get along a little better... see, even shaking hands..."

 "I don't want to flock with anyone."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I'm sorry, but it's harder now than it is with Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hey..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi that was rampant, but suddenly shunned and weak eyes, grabbing my collar and turning to Slaya...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stay with me... don't take it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, beyond jealousy, a complaint as if you're feeling anxious somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right... I thought Espi was okay now, unlike before... but we've only met for a few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it impossible to get anxious like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Slaya sighed at the appeal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nothing... I didn't even take it, and I don't need it in the first place..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh. I won't take it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya answers that, albeit a little skanky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi managed to get a little grown up with those words, even if he wasn't in a good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... my feelings shriveled... ridiculous. I'm going to bed."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Hey, you, where's the rice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't need it. I got two of these..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Slaya tries to get back on board. But once I stop my leg and stay facing forward...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What was your purpose?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the third time you've asked. If people asked twice, they'd say something stupid or something, but you seem so concerned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Told you? I just wanted to know what kind of guy you are. If only you'd known more about me by then."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I don't know what that means... you know me and what to do... assuming we just know each other and I'm not willing to swarm with you or get along. I'm not even interested. That's what I do... I hate it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being said, Slaya returns to the ship looking unconvinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's a pretty strong one...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on now... leave that boy alone..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Can't Espi get along with him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Murray! Murray! Murray! That boy, he's not just a bad character! He's such a dark kid! Shit!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi told me to leave him alone and look like he was ripped off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, we seem to have a negative impression of each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, don't you like dark kids?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, Espi...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Already... you can kill me... I knew... I... failed my mission... I no longer... I don't want any more children... if I filled up with war... my tough experiments were reduced... I wasn't beaten... but... I failed... even though they told me the fate of the country was at stake...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was pretty dark when you first met in the woods, too, huh? A few days ago, huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you knew that, your emotions would change so much, wouldn't they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And... that kid... the manager... no, even Slaya in the future...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I admit it. You don't know me, but you do. That's why I want to know. Which one would you choose with spice? Buy what? I want to know. I want to know. I want to know more about you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm intrigued by other people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, even him now. Yeah, but someday...
