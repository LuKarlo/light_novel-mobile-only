 The fact that I was also able to exercise moderately allowed me to sleep quite well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt refreshed and regained consciousness as I was swayed with a hammock suspended on board.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time, I feel the weight around my belly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I even thought it was something for a moment, but soon I knew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my goodness."

 My eyelids are closing, and no, the neighborhood is ready? You look like you're going to sleep.
</div>

 "... hey, Espi... couldn't you sleep?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ship was pretty shaky. I'm working out with Trayna, and I'm working out half the tubes perfectly, so nothing happened, but, like, seasickness?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... I didn't sleep"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven't slept. I can't sleep. Not really, I didn't sleep.

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess I have a pretty root for me and Slaya snooping around and giving away calorie friends last night where I'm not seeing them.

 "It's not weird. I'm your brother's sister. Your brother is mine."

 "Yeah, it is."
</div>

 Espi with a rough nose to assure. I laughed unexpectedly when you said something cute.

</div>

 "Ah, Traina......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "On second thought, if you think one of the seven brave men was guarding you all night, it's a hell of a thing."

 "Ah... I was..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at these last few days and last night's jealousy and anger, I'm going to forget, but this guy is the Seven Braves, isn't he?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though I did think it was a luxurious protection, I got off the hammock holding Espi back.

 "Ooh."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll look over the ship. Some of them are still asleep, others are already awake and defective, and others are out washing their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is he... isn't he... is he even the one who sleeps where people like this get stuffed?

 "Well, then it's refreshing to do gymnastics."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keep Espi in your arms and head out from the dim boat onto the outer deck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, unlike the morning sun in the mountains, there is the light of a powerful day pouring in, the calm sea level and the occasional breeze of a pleasant morning...... no...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... damn it"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi accidentally pinches my nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, there was some raw smell and the air that was going to freshen up was ruined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is that what this is about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, can't you smell it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "War stinks more. Look, there's no corpses, rotting, or messing around - there's a splash and a thousand things over there -"
</div>

 "Okay, okay, you don't have to say it anymore"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The foreword was withdrawn. Espi was more resistant than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'd be really surprised, too, because I'd say that flat with my cute Kyoton face as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still have the balance to be angry that I'm just a little bit with other little bitches, even though I'm tolerant of that...

 Then, just then, I found Slaya wandering on the deck, and he noticed us and looked at us.

 "Brother, you can't talk to me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just a greeting. Even though Espi, who was sleepy and shoeborn, awakens and stares at Slaya with his eyes that are still going to bite.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here, Espi. Say hello."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, because..."

 "Because it's not. It's Joshiki, Joshiki."

 Damn, this is just like last night...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Slaya also had a difficult face that seemed somewhat awfully unpleasant about what she thought was going on yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, the voyage is going well! We'll be in the port town of Genkhan by noon today! We're gonna get to the end of this, you bastards!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 and the voices of powerful sailors echoed in such awkward air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, this voyage is almost over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Slaya. What are you gonna do when you get there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... somehow, suddenly. Why do I have to tell you that? Nothing. I'll just go hunting for my next target if I redeem it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh, well. Who are we hunting?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You don't care who it is. Anyway, one end of something that looks strong. I hear there are many monsters in the Abosoa continent that have flown from the demonic realm, and I know it's around there, but I'm not going to tell you that"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh shit... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was just a topic making, but I don't think I'm going to answer this because I haven't opened my mind yet... haven't I noticed it myself, or has this guy generally answered?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "By the way, I'm not interested in anything, but what are you gonna do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I've heard you say you're not interested in anything! Oh, you're already stuck with all this stuff!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I... go for 'Sisonotami'"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ".................. what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, I answered honestly, Slaya leaned her neck because she didn't seem to come pinned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's where the Demon King's Army destroyed him, isn't it? I hear it's ruined now, but what are you going to do with that place? Are you looking for a treasure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's the place. You specialize in hunting monsters? You don't do treasure hunting or anything like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bullshit. You don't do that kind of quest with all those greedy golden deceased people that anyone can do with any luck."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being said, I thought Slaya would have opened her mind a little, but she laughed with her nose like she was somehow "disappointed".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyone can hunt for treasure. A golden deceased. I don't think so. In the first place, even if my purpose is treasure, it's not gold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not what I'm gonna tell him...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mm-hmm, give me you!? I said silly," Yes, yes, Espi. Yiko-ko. "Ah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, you come mucky and angry. I pre-suppressed Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then this guy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is that it? But hunters shouldn't have been able to operate on their own right now in Sisonotami...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I spoken a little concerned about the information.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Is that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's just... I think the coalition was under investigation and was off-limits except for hunters of investigators who belong to the state, the coalition, or are not directly hired... Oh, or are you hired?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So you can't? Well, if you're qualified, maybe you can sell it in person..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, is that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was confused by unexpected words, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even in modern times, it's exactly what the Coalition did to investigate the demonic world, avoiding bowling, but even here?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, it looks like Uncle Ben and the old Six Champions Nojah came, but there's still such a mendeau thing here...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But in the meantime, Hiiro and Maam of the Seven Braves from the Empire, and Benlinarf sent there -"
</div>

 "" 'Let's stop going!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and Traina deserve it, and all this time, the miracle is that Espi screams at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
