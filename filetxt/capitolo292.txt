 We took an oath. Try to get stronger even to the realm of the world where Earth is stepping in.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I can line up my shoulders with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I can stand next to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So we can keep him and his back together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Enough for him to rely on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its power is the world of the Seven Brave Men and the Six Champions, who are told legends in the former wars.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I felt uninterrupted in my battle with that dark sage Palippi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tran sla t e d by Ｊp m t l .ｃoｍ But even the perception was still raw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's no way out of the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't see the end of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, little one. How strong do you want to be?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The grand priest, the goddess, will be so tight that you will follow me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as the innocent Amae uttered purely so without any back, my chest was tightened even more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That word is what we have to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 T ra n slate d by Jp mt l.c o ｍ But we could not speak the word, timid by the breadth of the world in which Earth was stepping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a pity...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wearing is a menco ~. So, what the little one says, the ones you want me to rely on, are the lads and daughters who summoned the eagle? He's not as hot as I am."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bassara laughs in a good mood at Amae's words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, not only the six championships, but the kind of world where this legend of the underworld dragon king appears salaried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'd rather not be confused...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Basara the Dragon King of the Underworld..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In those of us who could only watch the two interact, Thaddis asked Bassara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You seem to be... the Great Demon King Traina and the Old Knowledge... but you didn't think anything of me against Boy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, I thought. I played with him just a little bit of playtime... sounds busy, but he got guts and funny. My daughter-in-law had bones too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's it... is it? You know, Boy's... elegant... that... and then... Boy's moves..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is there anything else wrong? It's not about his moves or his bare qualities... the big demon spiral that that kid and his daughter-in-law unleashed on me was filled with... hot enough for me to roll. I also felt a nostalgic soul. That's not enough."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What did Thaddess care and ask... Speaking of which, Earth was using the moves of the Great Demon King Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadis knows the circumstances. Earths said only Sadis knew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's regrettable for me. T r a n s lat ed b y jp ｍt l.ｃ oｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But more than that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm married to an interesting kid. Other than that, I'm not interested in the kid's background or title."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We couldn't say "sole" against earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For Basara, who can call the sole clams, they will look like us and other small things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We thought we had fallen in love with the "chosen ones" and others, even though we just happened to be born into a family of brave men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't even realize that the man I fell in love with didn't even look at me, like me who was complacent about both thoughts, etc.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... and I thought..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Again, anything about Trayna can be good with that...... the woes, as I said earlier, also have something feminine about the eagle. Watching you get sentimental."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a magnificent underworld dragon king Bassara smiled with some nostalgic eyes only for Sadis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's... I'm the example... of the descendants of the ancient woman, the brave Kaguya..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well ~. If Trayna was the only one I couldn't win in a fight... the only one I couldn't dictate was... Kaguya."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what? T r an sla ted b y jp ｍt l .co m
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ..................... Huh? Yes, now, what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Couldn't you dictate? Hey, now I have a very unexpected word from Dragon King of the Underworld, who is also a legendary and mythical resident...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My daughter-in-law is rotten enough for me. For a moment, the good onion spoken from one end to the other. And Kaguya is human...... well, the roots aren't in this world, but even the different races, they're good wannabes. So after a duel on a moon that wasn't settled, I dictated..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Kaguya, don't be a dick to me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Ugh heh heh heh, turn right. Sleep dead before you say it, Yaryoundragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's what they said. No, I miss you! But since then... I've been unable to break out on the ground trying to protect him. Even after he had a baby with this guy... even after he died..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no, wait. What? Where the hell should we start scratching!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, that's the thing...... so you... you pulled yourself out of the war thinking of that, su, human woman you liked... you even called yourself Dragon King?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the first place, I didn't just enjoy fighting with the strong ones in battle. Washi's life, fighting, drinking, playing with the idiots, and dairying with good onions. Good for you. Whether he was called Dragon King or not, he didn't have a country or an army, but he was free because he was super strong. In that sense, it wasn't like Treina"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With the Great Demon King...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He didn't really hate humans either. Instead, he usually liked human culture and stuff. But from the standpoint of becoming king over the demonic realm... the wishes of tens of millions of races to obey... and even Hakuki's fucking idiot Bokenas fanned those who hated extremists and humans... every pile forced him to move... which I also understood. So I didn't stop him from destroying Shisonotami. Instead, I decided not to enter the war, no matter what happens to his demon army. As a result…"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sisonotami...... but it is a magical city said to have perished during the Great War. And the home of Thaddess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bassara looked at Sadis like she had a lot to think about...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "'Cause we're done talking like this soggy excuse!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so Bassara forced me to interrupt the conversation as to whether she disliked this air. Tr ans lat ed b y jpm tl.c oｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 so forcefully that I was about to be blown away by that cry by accident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I look at Sadis with a nitwit and a grin again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Snuggle up, you seem so complicated. Let me solicit the sorrow of the past, the hatred for Trayna... my thoughts on that kid are real bye-bye."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bassara's words after identifying Sadis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though Thaddess was perplexed for a moment by the words...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh... heh... of course. For me... because Boy is what takes precedence over everything. I don't care what the Great Demon King Traina is to Boy... but I can't be the first to say it either... but I can tell you it's different now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It sounds like you're hot for a good onion, though you're still developing, that kid. I wanted Kaguya to tell me that, too. I'm upset, so the next time I see you, I'll call you Iggy. A cheater even though he has a wife."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed at Bassara's words and whether Sadis had anything to come to my heart, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bassara laughed more in a good mood at the look on Sadis's face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, I was surprised. I didn't know you'd be better known as the Dragon King."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought so, too. No, everyone would have thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Say it to me. Isn't Coibana a good thing? Isn't love also one that makes life better"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Cockroach "" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sinob also seems to be equally dissatisfied with the words of Ground's daughter-in-law by Kron, spoken by Bassara, but he is nodding next door on that point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I was snorting, too. Oh, and Rival... and Tukshi...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In that regard, Trayna wasn't interested in talking about that hand even if she drank... oh, I was so excited about 'the one'... I'm totally alienated..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The one?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not Trayna's men. Six of them... I only got involved with about two of them... well, I don't care about Hakuki... 'Akiko' is a delicious woe when I drank. Trayna and I had a great conversation. Well, he was pretty distorted, but it was hilarious."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Basara looked away again as if she would inadvertently miss some old days... slightly different from her earlier thoughts on the woman brave Kaguya, as if she thought of a distant friend... six? That's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Also, I might like to try a drink with him... Noja..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
