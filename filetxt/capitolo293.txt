<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After a few days of sailing, we arrive at our destination by the end of the day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's a fishing port that I've visited in modern times, more than a decade ago. Genkang Port Town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're almost there, brother"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you do when you get there? I don't want to see Hiiro or Maam."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Right. That's the same for me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The purpose of my journey is Shisonotami.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In modern times, however, I heard that Hu's father and the men of the former Demon King's Army were visiting the land for investigative purposes, working in fishing ports to earn a living on it so as not to encounter it. T r a n s late d b y Jp ｍ t l .c o ｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this time, you think my father and mother are in Sisonotami?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I'm not having trouble with the money because I got a lot of money in horse racing right now, but I still have to avoid just having a troublesome encounter in Sisonotami.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, I'll see you at camp for a while. If... to give you some experience as part of your training, why don't you do it at Hunter's?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina's suggestion. That's the hunter's job.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never ended up working as a hunter because in Hon Evo I couldn't register without presenting my ID.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tr a nsl a te d b y jp ｍ t l .ｃ o m But if I were you, I wouldn't be able to do it with Parippi's forged papers. I don't like the fake name...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Do you even camp while monsters exorcise or treasure hunt?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I will! Callie! Callie! Cali!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, Espi seemed fine, rather happy to sing something like Carrie's song and was hasty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the way Espi looks...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Pfft... man... take a sweet look at the work of a life-threatening hunter... you're still a kid"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Did I say something?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stick..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi stuffed with a muddy look against Slaya, who laughed with her nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual, it's a low boiling point espi against Slaya, but you don't have to provoke Slaya like that with Slaya either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while he said he didn't want to get involved with anyone, he was standing at a subtle distance just a little further from us, wrapping around like a bunch of paper, looking at us in a flicker and asking how we were doing, and both Trayna and I noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You care about us? If you hear that, you'll deny it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Slaya, what's that looking at?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, it's none of your business. It's just a quest list, handed out in the Hunter Guild." Tr ansl a t e d b y ｊp m t l.ｃ om
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh, heh, yeah. Let me see."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Why are you doing this? I don't have a choice. Don't get me dirty, will you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as always, the attitude that you honestly don't seem to tell me, and why you're telling me clams.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I look at the paper with a bitter smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The list then contained quests for items such as "Collection of Materials," "Investigation," "Monster Exorcism," "Bounty Neck Crusade," etc., as well as paintings, etc., or slanted lines for those already over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, this slope... the sea king squid, the one you crusaded"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehe, hunters are handed out like this... so when are we going to finish it next?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven't decided yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't even know this stuff existed because I couldn't even register as a hunter in Hon Evo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That also seemed like a list where I could choose my own future adventures, and I rolled around the list looking a little fun.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Super expensive......?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was rolling around the list and my hand stopped when I found a list that was treated like a different frame than before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's a quest of the highest degree of difficulty. The prize money's gonna be high. Yeah, that's all the danger, and several hunters have lost their lives so far. I don't know anything about hunters like you. It's not like an amateur suddenly comes up with a hand." T r ansla ted b y Jpmt l .co ｍ
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh, highest difficulty...... by the way, how long is that Great Sea King? The Great Sea King you crusaded."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... but I think it was more than strange to be in the highest degree of difficulty in a few moments..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, no matter how much part of my training I am, I'm not willing to make a very dangerous quest with the highest difficulty from the beginning. There's Espi, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I'm somewhat intrigued by what it says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah... Yamidilee..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, or... six champions of the Demon King's Army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The face and name I knew were there, so my hands stopped unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, my God, I didn't know Yamidilee was on the bounty list... I mean, he wasn't the bounty neck after the war, he was the original bounty neck. More like it hasn't been disarmed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, we're at war, and can't humanity put a prize on six victories?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think about it, Yamidilee was the highest prize neck in the world in modern times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, don't be all sorts of things if you think of it as the highest difficulty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trans lat e d by jpm t l.c o ｍ "Yamidilee... Huh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Espi on the boulder also reacts to Yamidilee's name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it a name that cannot be heard by the boulders as the Seven Brave Men?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya sighs at us like that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Either way, you don't have the edge on quests or bounty necks around there. You're not the kind of person who can get his hands on a half-armed stand. That's the class of the Seven Braves."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are seven brave men here, though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Slaya hasn't noticed anything about Espi? And you don't know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can't help but think that this sweetheart's jealous little girl isn't a boulder for the Seven Braves...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, you don't hunt these super celebrities on boulders. You can't just hunt this guy... in the first place, you can't hunt him with strength."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't change your history. And the possibility of becoming a stepmother in the future? Oh my God... I can't even win now in the first place... Though Trayna's helper Ali, the battle in Cacletail didn't mean for Yamidilee to kill me either...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anything else...... hmm? Parippi... Lyphant... Gouda... Noja... Hakuki... Six Champions Faces"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a face I know, a face I see for the first time, or in any case only the names are all those people at the level of textbook...... what is this beast ear toddler dressed like?!? This is something called a microbikini armor that was definitely in a glossy book I used to have...... no, that glossy book was only disposed of by Thaddis in seconds?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehe..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trayna, too, is a little happy to see the faces of those who, although in this form, were once companions and subordinates, and she misses them with her eyes narrowed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, you can't see all of these guys like Yamidilee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes... we can't see each other... no... we couldn't see each other... all six heaps except Yamidilee...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yet...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, hey! Look at that, Genkhan... that's weird!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, one of the sailors on the watchtower above the mast shouted as he peered into the telescope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "From Genkhan...... smoke is rising from all over the city!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whether I want it or not, this is the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, whatever happens, it's not weird, it's a warring age.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
