 The sailors' men hesitated and the passengers gave a frightened look.

 As we approach, we can see that the port town of Genkhan is engulfed in flames.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Many buildings have been damaged, and the berthing ships have broken their masts, and the hulls inside have been broken in two.

 Espi stares at Port Town with a serious look, clutching to my feet.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its eyes are not those of Espi, who have been provoking childish emotions for the past few days, but the serious eyes of those involved in the war.

 Slaya also rode herself out of the deck and groaned as she stared at the burning harbour town.

 And even though I knew it, I dared ask Trayna what she meant by confirming it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's war.

 Blood flies. When I noticed, the sailor man on the watchtower on the mast was carved by someone and fell to the deck.

 Demonic woman looking down at us as the guys on the deck screamed and slipped their hips.

 His face is close to man, but his hands are like sharp bird's claws, his arms integrated with his wings.

 He's covering his upper body with colorful iron armor, and he's about to fall in love for a moment, but he's immediately drawn back to reality with that brutal look that licks his tongue of returning blood bathed in his face.
