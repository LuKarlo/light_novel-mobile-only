 But once in combat mode, there is still a presence that makes a name for itself in history.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A presence manifested itself in the style of a man who was clearly stronger than any other harpy.

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But rather than colour, the tight muscles of the whole body, the cracked abs, and their wildly sharp eyes speak eloquently of this harpy as a fierce warrior.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, sure enough, this one was captain of the Harpies and an executive of the Noja Army... you've seen his face several times..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna also reacted. Does that mean this guy's exceptionally strong?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 The moment Espi held his hand and let go of his power, Harpy's captain was rocked at high speeds back, forth, left, and right, and a few seconds later he lost his mind and relaxed.

 Don Mai, Captain of Harpy. The other guy was bad.

 "Kill them all!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But defeating only the harpies who ran ahead or the captain who came aboard alone isn't over yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You noticed something strange, and now dozens of harpies are flying in line.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That number on the boulder is not Espi alone...

 "Shut up... we're all dead now... yeah, it's not. Blow them all!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 Espi shows you're putting a little effort into it as if you were lifting things.
</div>

 Then that was it, the harpies lying on the deck, the scattered weapons, etc. floated in the universe at the same time.

 "Well, I miss you......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sight is as if the 'world' is being manipulated by the will of Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to Harpy's troops attacking from above, Espi gathered all the harpies and weapons he had defeated in the air...

 As if, he hit it as it were shelling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The weapon also hits and intercepts all of Harpy's body, and the hit Harpies fall into the ocean one after the other.

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what are you talking about!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I waved it down to the harpies as it was.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh, heh, I miss you. But it's still something cute. When they hit me on the battlefield, it was more serious...... I will still remember the rest of that hell painting of millions of bodies, weapons, everything floating and hitting the Demon King's Army from above!

 He wipes out the enemy and waves at me with Nico's face shortly afterwards, but the shock is killing everyone who was on the deck.

 "I don't even know..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lost my mind with a terror-stained look and the harpies scattered over the sea...... drowning to death as it is...... but now in war...... they also kill whomever they want...... but they have trouble sleeping...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I was worried, Espi began to recover the harpies that were falling into the ocean with his abilities.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is that?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi nimmated...

 "You can't die lightly, can you?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I'm a little worried, Espi tells me that with an innocent look without any stray.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuha"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
