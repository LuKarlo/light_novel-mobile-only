 Go help the people being attacked in that port town. That means fighting the Demon King's Army.

 I'm sorry about the skirmish.

 And while I was confused and stuck in words, Espi asked the Harpies without waiting for my response.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? What... Temeer, what are you listening to?

 Espi normally tried to get information from Harpy's captain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Get information from the prisoners. Certainly that is necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Around here, Espi is also a soldier, so I guess it's a natural act.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not the problem.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I was currently at a loss as to whether I should go to that city and get involved with the Demon King's Army or avoid it like this.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Espi was different.

 Naturally, going to that city could also make people on this ship look dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why Espi, after considering it, thinks I move in the direction of going to help that city...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it's not... so... why are you, as a matter of course, going to help the people of the city until I fight the Demon King Army...

 No, I had a choice to abandon.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of interfering too much in the past, fighting the Demon King's Army of this era means fighting Trayna of this era indirectly.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Hey, listen to me, you guys. I still can't look at the situation in that city and just abandon it and run away. So I'm not even going to tell you guys to fight, and I'm not going to put you in danger. So just give me a little time. Make sure you think of something, just a little more!

 Sailors and passengers have an extra frightened look and Espi seems a little intrigued.
