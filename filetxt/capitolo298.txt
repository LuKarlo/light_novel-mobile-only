 In a fishing battle on the boat, Espi cheated.

 I got fish swimming in the ocean, not fishing poles, by my ability.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But its ability is so powerful that it just can't be cleaned up with cheats, which even Trayna admits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is why the force moves proposed by Traina......

 Get an accurate picture of where I am and where I can't see them, and tell Espi that, and Espi draws more and more of them this way to rescue them.

 And apparently, the demon king army guys have noticed, and they panic as they look up.

 Yes, there's nothing we can do about Amazonas, the Demon King's Army, rescuing us from the sky because this is how Espi destroyed Harpy's troops.

 You said you jumped a bow from the bottom, and it won't get here.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's magic, and it's trying to unleash a lot of magic from a distance.

 Compared to the people downstairs and the harpies here, I feel the power that's missing one head.

 It doesn't matter.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it's about that kind of magic, I can break through and prevent it with the Great Devil's Spiral... but it's not a good force to show off in this era right now, so this place accurately senses the point of lightning strike, then instructs Espi to swirl the ship around and dodge it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah...... what!? You gently dodged the magic of the elementary school?! Can you even make that kind of fine move? That ship! Then let it down and in a row...... Mega Thunder! Mega Thunder! Mega Thunder!

 Trying to come in a row, it's not as quick as punching, throwing stones, or bows and arrows than it is magic.

 I need a tame that it won't be chanted, and we won't miss that gap.

 "You evacuated most of the people in the city, didn't you? Then it's convenient. And then don't worry about your surroundings...... here's what you should do!

 That's when Slaya moved on her own.

 No, I didn't say anything in particular, but Slaya jumped off the ship under this circumstance.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, uh..."

 Of course, that's not to surrender to the Demon King's Army.

 "Hmm? A kid? Come down alone..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, Extreme Lightning Superbuster Sword!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Oh, no! Everybody, get away from me. Ooh!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the Amazonas blued their faces and rushed to jump off the spot, Slaya slammed a relentless and intense blow down the city square.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The earth is crushed, the debris is scattered, and the shock is causing the Amazonas to dance through the universe.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, I don't love him. Though the Demon King's Army, if it's not six championships, it's to this extent."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya knocked off the attack without negotiation or crap and plunged the opponent.

 Regrettably wasted, as if they had sidelined a good place as far as Espi was concerned.

 Something's pointing down at me and Espi, a mecha-motivated slayer.
