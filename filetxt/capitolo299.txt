<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now carve my playing requiem into it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya jumped off the boat, says something slightly kicky, but honestly, I'm in trouble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it's true, you've been trying to evacuate the city people like this and get them out of the city, but you don't have to go to the wazza fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shit, you're gonna do it, you fucking kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't you know how horrible it is?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's a kid who doesn't seem to even grow up yet... your sisters will mess with you!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amazonas plunged by Slaya's pre-emptive attacks, beating their bodies and dusty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not to the point of total annihilation, but the ones who still look fine are pointing their anger at Slaya as she begins to wake up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Slaya doesn't move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You can try. inferior aunts."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "Ahhh!!?? Kill him!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, provocation. And in the next moment, "Buthi" and the Amazonas, with something cut off, fly mad and at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll bite you to death. Ooh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chop it up and kill it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hit him naked and peel him off!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast. The beasts with the physical abilities of the beast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just wild... even...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... no need to use magic..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya is a Slaya, a famous hunter who can name it after a monster of the wild beast but a big one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya Ultra Beef Stroganoff Energy Punch!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he's an Orc and a soldier, he's not the guy to deal with on a parallel level.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, you little prick!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you can do this kid too! You do it in formation!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'll show you! Boys, you've got a lot of experience in your life. I'm going to charm you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it takes a lot of people at the same time...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Jetstream -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Attack -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Calm down, from the front on it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Grand Slam Buster Rush!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to show off its power, it kicked the flesh-eating women of the beast with speed and power that you can't imagine from those little hands and feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Guha, no, no, this guy... strong... different character!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsk... retreat! We're going back to the main army now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, to such a kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, relentless with the woman's face... no, she's not that sweet of a person to say...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, thanks to them, they feel a difference in power and dont withdraw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, with all the experience in life, is that the extent? You've wasted your life."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, Slaya relentlessly pulled the Amazonas down from the rubble as she dogged her face with its overwhelming power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shh, wow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I can't believe you were so strong... you defeated the Demon King Army!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even though the Allied Guards are wiped out all by themselves... the boulder genius Slaya!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We're on board, not just the Espi of the Seven Braves, but even the Genius Slaya!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We were saved -!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And for the first time in its activity, a great deal of cheer boiled down from the ship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm... if this is the case, don't be mendacious. From the beginning I... Ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As it were, well, don't say that, Espi. I evacuated everyone with your abilities, so I couldn't care less about Slaya without being taken hostage, and thanks to you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm... but I wanted to be more active and praised..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "'Cause it's okay. I know you're awesome."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Espi thinks Slaya gave him a good spot, but he needs to be embarrassed and in a good mood for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm... Nah, I'm bummed again... I'm the one who worked... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What kind of slayer are you staring at?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, aren't you refreshed? Angry with what...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... why don't you go downstairs... and stroke his head and praise him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'What?'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Trayna mumbled about the unexpected as she jizzed at Slaya next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No, no, what are you talking about? That guy, you don't seem to like that. I want to be vulgar, familiar...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... indeed... you would want to be flattered even if you were given a convenient praise by the greatly unaffiliated adults...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think you're... that kind of an adult for him anymore."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina comes up with a suggestion with a grin as if to try me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you sure about that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something usually says, "Shut up. Don't talk to me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, but it did turn out to be his work, and this place worked out...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn... Espi, wait a minute"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother? Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stop stroking Espi's hand and once I jump downstairs too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's coming down. He's turning to me. Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words you say against such a slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Isn't that amazing, Slaya"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He was strong."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what, you made me look so scattered yesterday..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's nothing. Well, I did wonder what I was going to do when I first jumped... but I'm glad you're here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh... ahhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, I honestly told him what I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King's Army I didn't want to fight...... well, as it turned out, this guy solved the problem, and the burden on Espi was reduced, and above all, there was no harm to the residents or the people on the boat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in my words like that, this guy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, shut up..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here we go. Here we go! The one from Traina, if it's me...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Beh, it's nothing. I'm a genius, and this degree is not at all obvious, and it's obvious, so I'm not happy to be praised by ordinary people, and I don't think anything because it's yummy that I can stroke my head, and even though she was supposed to be weaker than me earlier, she wasn't so praised and frustrated, and don't get me wrong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something came back after a lot more than I expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're really making a lot of noise, this kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even though it makes me kind of obstinate, I can see that it opens my mind a lot more than it has since my first encounter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And over the sky, there's an awfully swollen espi staring at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, these guys...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All of us... Dirty people... No way, even these kids..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, one woman pulled the rubble apart...... the dark elf just now. Was he safe too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seems a little hurt, but he's getting up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, you haven't punished me yet?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you... I already got away with your people... what do you say? Come on, can't you pull this place off?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suggest to stop the fight, but the hatred and killing overflowing from the whole body of the dark elf in front of me was unwittingly chilly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew... that's sweet... human... but... it would be tough to deal with Espi under this circumstance as well..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You give up your life, but you still do it? I thought so, but surprisingly, would you make a sober decision?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sora, it would be reckless to also fight Espi, one of the seven brave men against the six champions under this circumstance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So you're pulling this place off already?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehe, but... I saw it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... I don't know who you are, but you seem to like Espi a lot? In other words, you are the weakness of Espi..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dark elf pointing a suddenly distorted grin at me from a murderous look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is this guy...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And the lad there too...... he's definitely strong...... but he's a good enemy to the Great General"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh heh... right? General?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What's this guy doing? Hmm? Something bumpy......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Telepathy! This guy is reading somewhere... no way!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Got it! I'm returning now! With these guys! Ha-ha-ha, it's too late to regret it, human!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Raise your voice like Traina panicked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a disastrous magic engulfed Dark Elf's entire body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is similar to Yamidilee...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hatsunori Kara no Gosen Yenchoka......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chanting or magic? Attack? What the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care what comes...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Colour!? Warp, boy! Don't set up! Right off the spot - '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Medium Range Moving Magic Taxi"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, me and Slaya were suddenly swallowed up by the black vortex that appeared in front of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
