<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oooooooh, my Gooooood, you make me siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I can’t do it though! It might have made me feel a lot better to yell it out, but I can’t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I want to straighten out the princess who is bad-mouthing me, but no matter what I say, I would only come off as vindictive, and that is worse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So all I could do was pretend I didn’t hear a word and walk away, showing my pride.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a shame, Earth. But don’t be discouraged, keep pushing yourself again and again and become stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was about to leave, Taek, the instructor who officiated the mock battle between me and the princess put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a passionate shout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know? Your father ‘Hiro’ also suffered as many defeats as you from ‘Solja’ who was the strongest in the academy when he was the prince. But at the end of the day… he earned a spectacular victory in their [Graduation Commemorative Match]. So keep it up!” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor gives a thumbs up and some encouragment. Following his lead, my classmates send encouragement after encouragement one after another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Earth. Let’s see you awaken your heroic genes at the end of the day!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yes, Earth is the son of hero, ‘Hiro’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Will he show the talent that could defeat even the Great Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Every time I receive such encouragement, I’m moved by my friends’ consideration. But what about you guys? I mean, you’re worse than I am in the rankings, so first you should do ‘your’ best! And enough with the ‘Herioc genes’ already!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I do not say any such thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just walked away from everyone and responded with only one word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… W-Well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the whole, the first place is occupied by a genius who is called a prodigy even though she is a nuisance. My efforts are probably pointless. I’ll admit it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, there’s no shame in not being able to beat her. In this country, there actually aren’t that many of a same age that can beat her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even these guys have lost to the princess. And yet, they don’t look frustrated at all, nor do they have any intention of winning in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, well, it’s vexing, but I’m beginning to think that I have no choice but to accept that I can’t win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, enough about this, because there’s something else I can’t get my head around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How many consecutive wins does the princess have over Hiro’s son?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter how much of a prodigy the princess is, it’s pathetic that the son of a hero can’t win even once.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard voices from the corner of the passage way of the training ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Grown up voices. Perhaps the Imperial Knights are chatting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were talking about me without knowing I was listening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, the child of the Hero is not a hero.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The princess is exceptional, but… ultimately, the level of the generation below us is still lacking. Well, it’s also proof that we’re living in peaceful times.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This year’s Academy Graduation Match will be attended by royalty from other countries. I’m worried that they will be disappointed when they see the incompetence of Lord Hiro’s son.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even though he is the son of Lord Hiro, his writing and practical skills put him in second place. It’s shameful that he can’t take first place even once.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s true. And the second place is also a problem. It’s because ‘those two’ aren’t here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, them. ‘Those two’, who are currently studying abroad have already fully demonstrated their talents and were awarded medals by the King of another country the other day, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it is. In other words, Lord Hiro’s son being second in the absence of ‘those two’…… actually places him in fourth, so disappointing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard this kind of talk in many places.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a child, I was able to get perfect scores on tests and show better magic than others, hence they would always say “as expected of the Son of the hero, Hiro.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at 13 years old, I joined the Academy and competed with others for the ranking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I always kept the Academy’s Top Class ranking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, second place was my highest and I never took first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Academy is a warrior training institution where excellent children from all over the Empire and aristocrats would gather and enter after passing a difficult exam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, a gathering place for the Empire’s elites.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I think it’s a great achievement to be ranked second place there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, people around here don’t believe so it seems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Huh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my words, two men who seem to be in their thirties look back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Adorning armor engraved with the symbol of the empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve showed something pitiful to the Imperial Knights…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They appear slightly anxious with my appearance, but they laughed to cover it up and spoke to me in a friendly manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, no, No, I can’t be helped with the princess. The princess already has the power of the 【Advanced Warrior】 class at the moment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you can’t be too relaxed either, can you? Your father acquired the 【Advanced Warrior】 at the age of 16, just a year after graduating from the Academy, and he defeated the Great Demon King when he was 18.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After graduating from the Academy, the 【Aspiring Warrior】 is, of course, recruited as an 【Imperial Knight】, right? The current academy standard is quite rudimentary, so your training will be restarted from scratch, Young Master.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why as the son of a hero, you have to give it your best.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… that’s what I was told by the people I was most familiar with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instructors, classmates, and even people I just met say things like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, even my real parents say it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! By all means, please treat my dumb son well once he graduates!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eehh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uugh!… He’s here……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L- Lord Hiro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t be like that. Training hard? You got an advanced promotion exam soon, right? Good luck with that.” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ve got a baby on the way, right? Gotta show em how great Daddy is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How did you know that? I’m humbled…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the same scorching red hair as mine. He always has a cheerful laugh and a friendly demeanor and is loved by everyone. I heard he has a fan club in the Imperial City, the members are mostly women in their early twenties.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His sword skills and magic power have been classed one of the strongest in the world, and if you combine the two, his [Magic Sword] makes him the strongest hero in the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a kid I admired and respected such a father with eyes shining… But now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. I had some work to do and came to the training ground, but… I heard you lost to the princess again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The father who taunts me with a nasty grin. So annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Her father Solja and I were in the academy together. I never won a match against His Majesty other than the [Graduation Commemorative Match]. But your opponent is a girl, right? Isn’t losing every match pathetic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, unlike you, your dad was in a pinch before graduation because of the written exams, so you might be better off. In the end, what truly makes a man is this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, my father gently hit my jaw with his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is the man trying to say, “Power is what makes a man”?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, then again my dad could help with my sword training. If you taught me the swordsmanship the Hero used to defeat the Great Demon King… could I beat the princess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Half serious and half in jest, a little, I asked my father to examine my progress.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my father laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know… I’d like to guide you, but I’m too busy with work. So, diligently follow your training instructor or Sadiz. Besides, you can’t use [That Sword] yet. So, we’ll see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again, it’s the same as always.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you’re the type to grow slowly. Take your time and do your best.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m my father’s son. Yet, I have never been taught swords, magic, etc. by my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am compared to my father even though he has never passed on his skills and teachings to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And to top it all off, when he was my age, he was inferior to me as a student, but I’m the one being looked down on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch… I…… presently…… aren’t I working hard enough?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Type that grows slowly……? Such an unreliable thing to say.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s annoying. That’s why I want to shout like a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… Why am I a disappointment? I’m content! I’m second place in the Academy ranking! Isn’t that great!? Praise my efforts a little instead of consoling me! Were you ever in second place? Yet you’re disappointed? Second place isn’t good enough for you? Why do I have to be in first place?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A pitiful kid… I can’t control it even though I’m aware of it myself, but I’m still a kid and I’m full of self-loathing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tsk… I’m fine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, I pushed past my father and ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for appearing on the day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since there is a stock to write 200,000 characters in Golden Week, Post every day for a while, so I will continue to post more than one day to see the situation, thank you in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] So, remember those naming conventions I said to look out for? The Hero is actually called “Hiiro” and the emperor name sounds like “Soldier”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Enter the man himself. From the description I opted to give Hiro a super casual speech pattern, regardless of who he speaks with. Unless the mood calls for a more serious atmosphere.
