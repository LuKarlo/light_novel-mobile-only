<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This park right now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Say Aah~, Darling, Please~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaaah, Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it delicious?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ish sho good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though there are people on a carefree date like this, what am I doing in the park?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But to train your eyes… Is it something that can be trained?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My goodness… it cannot be helped, I shall teach you a little bit about the eye.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once I stopped reading, I sat facing the Great Demon King in the shade of a tree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, like Tre’ainar’s class, the explanation began.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First of all, it is possible to train the eyes. To begin with, both humans and demons have muscles around their eyes. You can use the muscles to move your eyes up, down, left, and right. This is called ‘eye movement’. In other words, if you train the muscles around your eye, your eyeballs will move faster and better perceive moving objects, which improves your dynamic vision.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dynamic visual acuity. I only had a vague image that a person with eyes that had good vision and quick reactions would be said to possess [excellent dynamic vision]. Is that what it meant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, to perceive moving objects.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Improving dynamic vision makes it easier to perceive an opponent’s movements and attacks. Under such circumstances, if you add breakthroughs to improve your physical abilities, reactions and agility trained in ladder training, will anyone be able to catch you anymore? An exaggeration perhaps, yet…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Eye movement… I had never thought of that before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And one more thing to train is the ‘peripheral vision’. Out of the center your viewpoint. Perceive the entire scene from a broader perspective, not just the center. For example, look at a couple enjoying their lover’s lunch on that bench.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I hope you end up miserable.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… That aside, you only have the two lovers in your sight at the moment, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha? After all, you just now, had me to look at them …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, what is the color of the bench they are sitting on? How many people are behind those two benches? How many children are playing with playground equipment? How many men and women are there? Do you know how many trees are growing?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, not that far…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However… supposing as an example, instead of that couple, I were to say ‘Remember all the scenery in sight’, would you have noticed more of the surroundings?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I thought so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were told to burn the entire scenery that was in sight, I might have realized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But when I was asked to look at that couple, I only saw that couple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In battle, tis important to pay attention not only to the opponent but also the environment, the scenery, and the picture as a whole. Just because you fight a swordsman does not mean you only consider the sword your opponent wields, right? You examine their face, gaze, foot position, and various other things as well, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The more information you get from your sight, the greater your visual field and reaction during combat. In addition, training of dynamic vision and peripheral vision leads to brain activation and concentration improvement, and it leads to a more improvisational response to the situation based on the information obtained from the vision.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what Tre’ainar says. He exercises his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dynamic visual acuity and peripheral vision. I had never trained such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As you cannot use breakthroughs yet…… to focus your magic on one part of your body… techniques such as concentrating the magic only on the eye cannot be done yet. As such, we shall train your eyes in earnest until you can properly implement the breakthrough.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I thought, ‘Why did I come to the park?’, but listening to the story made me want to learn by all means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar says, if you train your eyes, it will be easier to foresee your opponent’s attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s something I have to learn from now on because I’m going to fight with martial arts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right. I wanted to train my eyes, too. So…What shall I do now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. First of all, begin with ‘eye stretching’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Stretch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he said ‘stretching’, I thought of the flexibility I’m doing all the time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do it with my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『When people are trying to get small letters or detailed information, they focus their eyes on one point. The muscle of the eyes then hardens. First, we shall loosen it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar faced me with his eyes wide open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First, wink one eye!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ten times or so, but at a constant rhythm. Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since I was little Sadiz often tease me or play a prank, but in the end she would wink at me and say, ‘Fufu♪’, and ‘Oh, I got you’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did I remember that now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, after ten repetitions, do the same with the opposite eye, wink, wink , wink , wink , wink , wink , wink.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, the legendary Magic Eye of the Great Demon King, Rikudo Eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father once fought against this eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eyes that have created all kinds of tragedy for my father, for the heroes, and for mankind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Next, close both eyes at the same time and open them. It closes tightly and opens wide. Do this ten times as well. Yes, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, I’ve got to bear it. Tre’ainar is serious about training me, and this is the way he teaches me …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And next, round and round with my eyes this way-』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… O-Osu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This time, going round and round the other way.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, what am I doing in the park on my holiday? In a park with kids who are dating, enjoying picnics with their families, and playing innocently, they literally turn their eyes together with the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Going round and round and round』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bufufufufu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, the Great Demon King winks, blinks, and turns his eyes! Like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What are you laughing at?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well of course I would laugh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is how it turned out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I know. It’s my bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar is serious, so I’m sorry I couldn’t take it seriously, but I’ll still laugh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hah, even if you said I’ll die if I laugh, I’ll still laugh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Good grief… Anyway, tis important to loosen the muscles of the eye. Perform these exercises as regularly as you do the ladder training. If you do… This may also possible! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha-What!? T-The left and right eyes are moving apart!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, tis a technique to eliminate blind spots by looking over all directions by freely moving the left and right, this is the secret technique of ancient martial arts -』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow~, so weird!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Gah… Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I unintentionally opened my mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I really regret it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, good. You will perform these stretches in the future.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tch, I have more and more things to do every day… but. Well, I think this is also a compulsory subject, so I have to do it seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, anyway, once the eye muscles have been loosened like this, your dynamic vision and peripheral vision by speed reading.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu… I mean, I’m really speed reading. I thought it would be better to train with sparring or something like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speed reading. I’ve never cared that much except when I read a question on a test.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understand the dynamic vision and peripheral vision, but I wonder if such a thing improves by speed reading?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Will it become stronger by being able to read faster?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar affirms without any hesitation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not underestimate speed reading? First of all, because you only see ‘speed reading’ as ‘reading fast’, tis the only way to go, and if you want to apply the power you gained there elsewhere, the path will expand as much as possible.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As you are now, can you get stronger by reading faster? The idea is a typical example of ‘taking things at the center and not more broadly’. In addition, speed reading is not just to read. By not only reading but also understanding the content, you can develop your overall grasping and understanding skills. and by further increasing the speed you improve your concentration and judgment.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For example, reading a book. I read one character at a time, but if I increase the number of characters to see more at once instead of just one? What if I speed up reading rows? It can improve the function of the eye, leading to the ability to move viewpoint and see a wider field of view.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ma, yes, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What happens if after speeding up you can comprehend what has been read? What happens when you remember? The memory of the brain, and the instruction from the brain to the body is faster.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In other words, you have trained your reaction speed with a magical ladder. It starts with the command from the brain, which improves the nerve, muscle transmission response speed. Then, if the brain’s understanding and judgment, and even the instructions become faster…… what will happen?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being said, I finally ‘understood’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That everything is connected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The faster you make decisions about how to move next, the faster your reflexes will be.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is so. That is why if you train your eyes, no one can catch you anymore.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The theoretical explanation was convincing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, information from the eyes and ears was processed with the head, from which the brain gave commands to the body, passed through the nerves, transmitted to the muscles, and moved the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I improve that ability with ladder training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, this time, the ability to process the information entered from the eye with the brain is also trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it is indeed desired, it will be useful enough in battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis speed reading for that, but… As I said earlier, there are many ways to train speed reading even in situations where breakthroughs are not yet available. There is a trick that improves this even more quickly and dramatically.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A trick. I don’t think that’s the kind of word I’d get from Tre’ainar’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of the Great Demon King seemed to me heavy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is “Instant Memory Magic, 【Canonicon】.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a magic that I had never heard of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can somehow imagine ‘Instant Memory’ from the name, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The basis of speed reading is not to read sentences with the eye, but to capture the text reflected in the eye as shapes and pictures. There is an ancient magic that can be learned which engraves what is in sight into the memory of the brain. That’s the magic of 【Canonicon】. Do it while using this magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it such a system after all? He said it was instant memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To use this spell means to recall everything that moves into sight. Therefore, if you continue to use it, the view of things naturally will be ingrained in your body, so that you can perceive ‘the whole rather than just one point’ even without the use of magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eee~, naturally… Instant Memory… it sure sounds convenient to memorize.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not memorization. Everything in the field of vision is stored in the brain as a picture. So long as you remember this spell … Even if the maid were to find your erotica and dispose of it, if the contents are already engraved in the brain as a picture…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know, but I’ll learn it right now, that magic! I’m sure I need it now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But recently, I’ve learned magic that I use for training, not for actual fighting…
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
