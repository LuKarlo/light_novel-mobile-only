<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think you could use the same warp as Yamidilee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is not good. Espi and I fell apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How far away? Can we rendezvous properly?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reminds me of Espi's face laughing without giving in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, how much does disappearing without saying anything from before him hurt him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if this is the 'last goodbye' of our time, I won't admit a goodbye in this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Solve the problem in Socco and get the espi......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General! Now bring you... Huh? … a little uneven…"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, where the hell are we... to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Outside the light from the black vortex.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where the hell am I? As soon as I thought about it, Dark Elf, the Ten who brought us here... Was his name definitely Larwifey? raised a barbaric voice, suspicious of the sight that suddenly caught both Slaya and I.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what... you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Show up suddenly... you're young..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Demon King's Army... No way, even these boys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought we'd be taken in front of Noja, but we doubted the sight in front of her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah...... Nanda Koleja?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprised at us for showing up, the "human" men with sad faces are making rows of vertical and horizontal slacks and long snakes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know you have your hands tied with rope and you are a prisoner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I also know from the fact that most of them have a strong figure, that they must be captured Allied soldiers and fishermen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from the landscape...... you can see the sea...... the plains?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think we're that far from Genkan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don't know...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, this is..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looks like Slaya is inadvertently "woo" and about to throw up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't help it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, why..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why are all these guys naked?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, all these guys were naked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not even wearing pants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You got a cold? Exposure freak or naked festival?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when Trayna, who was beside me, sighed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I just saw the prisoner... it's something you'll soon find out whose army is capturing you...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With his head slightly restrained and frightened, but somewhere he seems to miss it, then he has a complicated grin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you have any idea whose army it is?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Is this normal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey there! Bella, what are you talking about? Don't mess with the line!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when the yelling woman's voice sounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It won't be long before they say it's the Grand General's inquisition...... hey, those two! Why are you dressed? Just get naked... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ralwifey! What are you doing in there..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What happened to the execution of all residents in Genkan and the procurement of gold and food?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The armed Amazonas came from beyond the broken hedge surrounding us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even when they looked at us and yelled at us for a moment, they immediately noticed Larwifey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "These guys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralwyfe tried to explain us... that was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? The air? The atmosphere? No, a sudden freezing cold struck me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn't attacked by anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet my whole body is shaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, this is... uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya is shaking, too, and sweating on her cheeks even though it's supposed to be cold.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, I'm out..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you bugger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's... the strongest Demon King's Army... one of the six champions..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And all the bent naked men around us are blushing and shivering, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What happened...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you here... child... hold on tight"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I'm fine. If you are now... you will not be crushed by the pressure of six active champions. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, under this overwhelming pressure, suddenly in my head, the faces of Yamidilee, Palippi and even Basara, the Dragon King of the Underworld, came to mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without a doubt, the source of this pressure is that class......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard voices from nowhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just hearing my voice makes me tremble extra strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, with a giant blister from the sea, something came out of under the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You've been drinking too much, you've been peeing. No, peeing in the water is extraordinary ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the ocean...... HUGE...... bucket stuff? Monster? Beast?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it's big!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 of a giant body like Basara the Dragon King of the Underworld...... fox? Besides, you have nine tails?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Huh... you look like' that way '... well, should I have' bestialized 'to show the prisoners majesty...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "hey... what, that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Take a good look, child. Arrangements and more are listed in the figure of the' human form '...... that also looks like another one...... Mutation of the Fox Beast Man...... Nine-tailed Demon Fox, Toddler Girl Fighter General, Noja!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna on the other side narrows her eyes and looks up somewhere she might miss it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, this guy?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the arrangement, he looked messy young and looked like a general wearing unproductive clothes...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... uh, what was it? Oh, yes, it was a stigmatizing pet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rise from sea to shore and let your wet body tremble at high speeds all over you to fly water.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tons of water pouring down on us as if it were rain, but we're all so speechless that we don't care about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha ha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just take one step and the ground will shake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The mouth angle of the bucket thing hangs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are you gonna do with a glimpse of us from the top?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then only a guy who doesn't want to die barks like a dog and flirts. If you're upset, you don't even want to keep them... and I just want to say... uhm... Pat, look, they don't seem to like you all."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know what you were talking about for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh,... I'm kidding, it's Noja the Six Champions! What a trick! This is how you do it!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, while his hands and feet were tied and naked, one man barked at Noja...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If this is your way of doing the Demon King's Army, I will gladly die..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shit, we're still in the middle of a conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the next moment, Noja's tail swung down vigorously as if it were a hammer, with a huge bottom invisible hole in front of a barking human eye...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, wow... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I was a little more sloppy, I'd be crushed by Petanco... because I know that, and the man who screamed bravely is now alone breaking my heart and letting go of my hips.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's good to have a gentle heart that doesn't hunt for life without darkness, like my Hakuki and the outgoing Admiral's Palippi... well... eh... yes, pet candidate... hmm... ok"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Noja, who seemed to have come up with something and thought about it, caught a huge mouth angle in a nibble.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are you gonna do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's a bummer!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" - Huh!!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the next moment, Noja, sitting slowly on the spot, waved a huge tail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's all you got, mega-class? No, more violent gusts suddenly!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power I feel from the beginning to the rear, quite far from the beginning, makes my body mellow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this is at this distance, what's the lead?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "GAAAAAAAAH!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there are hundreds of naked men flying in front of us like that screaming in the current storm all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn it, I said, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bumped into all the naked men that flew in and ended up being flown out of my endurance, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, sweat it. Yeah! My ass is flying. Ugh!! Uh-oh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's hard to see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly it was too shocking for me to react immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shit. What about Slaya?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General, come on, Megawindshield!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kee, dirty! Iron/Iron/Doom!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hii, Admiral, you're here too!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yabe, hey, motherfuckers, get out of the way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, the General..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I'm magically preventing that Ralwife and Slaya, but I... Slaya... with that magic, I wanted you to help me if I could too...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have you eaten Noja's servants?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsk, tsk, tsk! Whoa, whoa!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Plucked, I punched myself in the back somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something's making a noise about Gashangashan, but to what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Hey, kid, take care! And then... indulge in a hell of a painting...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ouch... what the hell... hmm? This..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where I got blown up and poked in, I got stripped, scattered armor, helm, weapons scattered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They are engraved with Allied markings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, but..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All of you... you haunted fox..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a mighty..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there are just as many bent naked men around me who have been struck in the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But those eyes are somewhere weak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surely most of them would know now.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The difference in overwhelming force as if it were a natural disaster...

 "To the extent that I didn't kill him, I did. Now, who stands up... and on top of that, still shows the will to defy? Oh, my frigid, cute brethren. You can eat broken fish if you like."

 That one is different.
