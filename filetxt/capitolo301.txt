 "Ha ha, come on, get up! And you're going to get a boner. ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A haunted fox that can roar so loud that the atmosphere trembles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A level monster that comes out of a picture book like Bassara.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How can I do that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General, suddenly the elementary students were in danger."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh, Ral, I'm so glad you're okay! Ah, speaking of which, I'm just saying... eh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ha... of Espi..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you remembered. Sorry. Sorry. Where are the fools who butched my friends Shojovich and the seven brave fucking kids?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this hellish painting, Ralwifey laughed bitterly and went forward and Noja laughed luxuriously when she realized it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oh......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's one sphere of iron rolling on the plain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment its sphere cracks......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shit... you bugger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya stood up sweating down her cheeks from inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, yeah, me too...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, wait, boy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What the fuck?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Noja of the Future is in the position of the new government of the demonic world..."

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't you know your face? And when you do, you will show your face... '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm blind Kojiro, or I don't know who anywhere. I had no choice but to show my face to the demon king army guys, but when I was about Noja, I was on a boulder...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? I'm not a fucking Espi kid."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yep. This guy looks like one of Espi's guys... just a kid but his powers..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ahh, somewhere... oh, yeah! Gouda and the others are screwed, the hunter's genius boy for sure..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!? Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja smiled, and Ralwifey seemed to notice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tell me who he is...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sure...... Slaya? Or something like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... heh... it's an honor to have the legendary Six Champions know your name"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "has... better, I see... good eyes, and atmosphere. It seems a lot more attractive than the pet candidates I've just flunked out. Nevertheless......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "……………"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I hate hairy kids, too. Because I don't have the pleasure of shaving." "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the next moment, one noja tail rises loosely......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tail swung down towards Slaya at high speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't look sweet, you bugger!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ho."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya reacts. Evasion. Can't he do it easily on a boulder?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while avoiding...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Iron and Ultra Hyperduck Nace Balmunk!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "To, is that the convenient magic of rumors? You should move to a blacksmith, not a hunter."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up, I'll have that neck -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hanging on to fight back...... wait!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a big weapon, if you can guess, it would work, but your opponent is a six-hundred champion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said he did it directly from the front...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I just dodged a single tail, and there are nine giant tails of Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The second one stretched out of Slaya's blind spot and tied his little body to catch him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shima..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha ha, what the heck - you've been blessed with them so far... no matter how talented you are, if you're unlucky, you're on the level of dying soon... this is why I hate kids... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, let go! Yikes!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, it's a good eye in this situation. If we're twenty years late...... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shit, Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not if you're lost.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just have to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what happens to history, you can't abandon it here...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mm-hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what! Look at people jiggly..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, what's up? The Noja one, though he seems to be thinking of something by looking at Slaya jiggly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Once upon a time... a man named Shining Genji tried to marry a young girl and raise her to her own ideals. Unold... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Looking to the future and keeping it... gufu ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Become...!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Doesn't it seem interesting to make an observation diary of your beard and cock until you become a Bobo?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh... heh, don't be ridiculous... who gives a shit about you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ho ♡ That's fine! I want to cry to those eyes, woohoo, temper, mess. Bye ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, this is... you suck at boulders... they don't seem to kill you, but it's dangerous in another way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya is also blue as zo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yay, help me. Um... But okay? I'll show my face..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I don't have a choice... but I do report that on this occasion... Espi... but now...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah... right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in "The Right History," which Traina was saying, "Espi was escaped to captivity by engaging Noja".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Slaya in modern times is alive and well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, you don't have to do anything to help, and Espi's here to help... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... duh, what do I do? Keep it up... just keep looking..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... mmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All this time it's not like a demon king army soldier who doesn't even know the kind of name we met in the woods.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not the same as when I was in Koziloh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here I fight Noja the Six... how much is that...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Traina sighed once, but immediately turned her grin towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "O child... even if this world we are in is the past... now is all we have left with you. Then this moment, forget the course of time and everything. Just face the reason why you really have to fight."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I told you, even in the woods where I met Espi of this era, I thought that was history... you had to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With that, no matter what influence the Demon King's Army of this era has had by you… don't think about backwardness for the rest. I'm not as feminine as you think I am."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the only reason I didn't want to fight the Demon King's Army so hard in this world isn't because of all the impact on history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If something happens to the Demon King's Army that I do extra, it pushes me out, saying stop thinking that I indirectly put Traina...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't hold back on the Great Demon King. You listen to your master."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh... kuhaha... right... oh... ok..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna is right. I'm not the kind of person who can think of anything else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think about messing around... just... helping Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do we help?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Take him down!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Oh, yeah! It's not like Yamidilee, who had a blank or tried not to kill you, or Palippi, who has been lazy...... make it active burly and one of the other six arms...... your fathers' rival, the Six Champions...... I'm going to knock you down!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. It's exactly six championships of active ballistics, fighting a world of war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, we have to go beyond that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, go -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 '... hmm? Oh, boy! Wait a minute! Give me that...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?... Ah! Well, this one."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And before giving up and exposing her face anymore and trying to get out in front of Noja, Traina noticed and pointed to something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I saw it, too, and I accidentally raised my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All this time, I was fortunate that the Allied forces were being naked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because a helm is rolling at my feet that I think the soldiers who were removed were originally equipped with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Black helm...... oh, there's a cape too! Oh, my God! All right, here's the thing..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Wait, as long as you hide your face...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, I'm being careless, but I'm getting a little excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I can hide who I am and think it through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha ha, let's start with… see if you really haven't grown one ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh!? No, don't, don't, don't! I won't tolerate anything that humiliates me. No, stop, stop. -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And maybe he's wearing it -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All right, I got it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wah, ha, ha, ha, ha! Until then, Toddler Girl Fighter General Noja! I will never forgive you for anything more outrageous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm? What is it? This laugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Huh? So... who is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, my voice seemed to have arrived, and Noja, as well as Noja's Amazonas, and Slaya's gaze, could be directed at me at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Allied soldiers and Genkhan men who are falling after Nojah busted them... they seem to be losing their minds or confused, and they're not responding right now... okay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... who is it? Um... the knight in black."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wearing a black helm and a black cape...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I... No, I don't condone tears in this world, even if they're monsters! Good boy's side! It's lagernman!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm going to answer Noja, who I'm going to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lagerman? You've never heard of it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then engrave into it. The name of the one who will defeat you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What no?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, like the brave man I admired when I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Biscuit, the decision pose is perfect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No... you're hiding your face, so you don't have to change your tone... Huh? Is that your ideal? And if it's a pseudonym, even Tapil Bael......'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Sounds like you don't like Trayna.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I don't like Tapil Bael.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow....................................................................................................................."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You've never seen it before. Where Slaya is shining her eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, you turn your pure sparkling eyes at me like you did when you helped my childhood father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, uh, respond properly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
