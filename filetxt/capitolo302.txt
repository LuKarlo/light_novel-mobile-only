 Power, speed, skills and tactics.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Use everything to try.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No need to spare any effort.

 Before I ran out, the Amazonas tried to stand up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Noja took control of it before it moved out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you won't be enemies in bundles..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... for Christ's sake... Lar, what the hell kind of guy did you bring here? The Great Demon King and" Colour "are different... but that's not true..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won't let you put a cross spear in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja is willing to intercept herself against me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, whoa, Big Devil Sonic Flicker!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ho ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ruraaaaaaaa!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strike! Strike! Strike!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's Noja. He freely manipulates Fuzzy's big tail and shoots off all the shockwaves I unleash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm gonna cut it off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Though flicker, it's just a left jab. Don't show too much more than that. For starters, restraint is enough'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Patience."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Noja's nine tails become whips, gusts, sharp blades, giant blunt weapons, tornadoes, and shields of iron walls. First, get used to that tail movement, surface area and mass'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I don't think flickers are the only way to do damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just purchasing. They're six winners.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's all for my biggest and strongest blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, let's go!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a counterattack from Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You found it troublesome just to prevent my flicker, swinging one of my tails down against me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would be willing to change the tip as sharply as a blade to pierce it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Can you hit it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can't hit such a big descent. Backstep...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's the end of it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And right after I backstep, another tail circles behind me and tries to wrap it up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course I do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Cross-Step"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Step to the left on the verge of catching me from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with the use of two tails for the attack, I anticipated that my defense had slightly diminished, and I put Noja's face on it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Demon Sonic Smash!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll blow the upper shock wave off the diagonal bottom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ho"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The third tail proved to be my shockwave shield in front of Noja, preventing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it the first time you've scratched six more copies of this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a bone break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... it's something to be here... apart from this hunter kid... something that the Demon King Army doesn't even know about... now it's impossible for the Ralls not to deal with."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He also looked at me and seemed to grasp some of my powers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what, that mask... no, I guess the contents are the guy the elementary school brought... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow... there's a man who can do it from the front... besides the Seven Brave Men..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, the Admiral isn't serious yet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh. Let it go. Hey, you should get fucked by the general."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Amazonas seem to have been a little surprised by me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And don't eat the entanglement, I'm a little away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you don't even seem to think what's gonna happen to our boss to this extent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, I guess Noja's power isn't like this yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... and how can you use that glowing power... I'm even more interested. Strip him naked... I'll reveal everything!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coming! Now... five at once!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He restrains Slaya with one tail, defends him with three tails, and attacks me with five left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like filling in all directions and eliminating the escape...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There is a way to live. Hard to see and difficult route... child, if you are now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that technology I've been polishing ever since I came into this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical radar!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the woods, in the battle against Koziloh, and on the ship… the imminent threat against me, and the slightest gap I can see in that threat, I will not miss it now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "hey... no!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A glowing path, visible from among imminent threats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following that route, I dodged the five tails attacking me at the same time, moving forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was able to pack my time with Noja at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 of the big figure, at its feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, big devil -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't let me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Being nostalgic to me is blocking the three remaining tails to protect nature and Noja's face and other steep points.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not what I'm after yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Right Straight!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I punched Slaya in the middle of the tail restraining her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was that all Noja was unexpected, too, the protection was weak, and the shock zeroed the polo and slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I catch a falling slayer and distance myself from my once packed intermission with Noja all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First, evacuate Slaya to the safety zone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Otherwise, because I'll have no choice but to worry about the flickering in the coming battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you hurt? Boy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh... yes..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Right. It's okay now that I'm here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Carry the overheld slayer to a point away and drop it to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you know, you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Leave it to me from here on out. With this pride of mine, I will make sure to protect you. I need you to watch here. Bye!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'No, you... it's too much...'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya looked like she was in a paw somewhere, but she was relieved that the injury seemed particularly unharmed. Well, I almost got molested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "How cool... Lagerman... who the hell are you!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes!? You realize who this guy is... Yikes, you're a surprise asshole, this guy... '
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought you were a rubbed kid, but you're still a surprisingly pure and good one, Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trayna's still troubled by her uneven taste, but she's got to fight me and each other from here on out, so we're not fighting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know... you'll do it... okay... it won't be long! Ouch! It's been a long time since we've been wet in battle! Keep him! I'll hunt and keep you. ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Noja, not angry, not surprised, just laughs happily at this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's a sharper and more evil grin than when I was about to prank Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Phew, well, aside from how tasteful it is... from here, my child. Finally, he wields his power... his style of combat... it 's-'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let me show you! I'd be honored! Fighting style only shown to opponents who are willing to fight -"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I've ever done is move my tail, but Noja's legs, and even my whole body muscles, make me feel intimidated, just like a wild beast would hunt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I hadn't met Basara, Yamidilee, and around Paris, I'd have been so intimidated that I might have fallen back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
