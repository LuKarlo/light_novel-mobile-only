<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered unexpectedly when I was drinking and complaining to my friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Nowahahahaha, are you worried about a perverted female fox who has broken the hearts and dignity of countless males! I'm late... Nowahahahaha!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Don't laugh, Rosala. It's real. A man of destiny alone is not enough. Dandy, whether you're kidding or kidding for the rest of your life, don't break your heart and don't give in. Just leave me alone! But more than usual, this guy just takes the collar and crawls on all fours, and he's just a weak guy with a pussy and a dick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - If the weak can't, who's the strong? Someone stronger than you would be, wouldn't he? Oh, I can't, can I? I already have enough wives, and I'm not going to leave him in love for the last time in my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hmm. What would have been so good about such a poisonous heroine? Well, aside from that, the strong can't be stronger than they want. The straw is weak enough to be easily restrained and faked, and on top of that, a strong heart is good!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That's not true! It's distorted... but then... the postcard is stronger than the sticky one... and you're not part of the demon race... and humans... are subtle around Micado... How long is your pussy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, Micado is not the type. He's not good at teaching people. I wonder, can he count against humans? Half of them are fairies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 'm not a wagamma, but I care about the details... that's why I'm late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Woah, don't say that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lagerman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know who he is with a mask, but he is clearly quite capable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the feeling of voice, it is around the first half of teens at the age of humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn't apply to a lot of people, but it seems interesting to keep them in anticipation of the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to keep it with that hunter kid and train him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you going to give me what I want?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So make sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't you dare get it ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahaha, hey! Leave me alone, pussy! It's a little rough. Don't get caught up."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "I understand!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now, let's go! Aahhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you are exposed to this form of violence, the attack will become widespread, making it suitable for ravaging enemies, but causing them to get involved with their allies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially if you just swing one or two tails like this one, it's not an unstoppable level opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let's go..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, if you activate my Windforest volcano, you will be killed instantly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wind... the meaning of swinging nine tails like a whip at high speed, and blowing everything around with the afterwaves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fire... the meaning of a special blow that bundles nine tails together and knocks them down like a giant hammer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lin... a defensive technique that uses nine tails to parry all attacks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mountain... an iron wall barrier with nine tails that covers the entire body of the stray and prevents any attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ultimate mystery of straw. I broke... the Great Demon King, Rosala, Kagya, Micado, and then... ah, maybe there's plenty of them... but I can't beat this guy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Disease-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lager Goose Step!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried to rattle him out of the straw wind... and let him run around, make him cry and pee... but before he activated my straw move, he jumped into his feet instead of running away...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, it's reckless to jump in."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hehe, come on, what do you think?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Doesn't it scare you to jump into this giant, stray opponent?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or did you shoot him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fighting in this giant straw is difficult because it is not very clever against the small enemies that are squirming at its feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all, an attack on Windforest Volcano is suitable for a wide-ranging attack, but it cannot be attacked so close. If you fail, your tail will not attack, and you will hit yourself and self-destruct.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're going to crush me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When this happens, I'll crush you with my hands and feet, tear you apart with my nails... ah! I'll keep him, so kill him.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now... not now, Lagan Split Step!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, did you... slightly avoid crushing him with his stray forefoot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not too fast... but there's no waste in the movement and there's something fishy! The reaction was quick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Urochiro and... but how do we defeat the straw?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, I think it would be better to stop moving even if I did a little damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can do this much, attacking a little harder won't kill you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, even if you don't have to die, you can sleep alone for the rest of your life, take it off, shave and grip it. It seems difficult to play with it ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Cheeky, if you hit me with a single blow, it's not a catastrophe ♡ with straw claws..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lagansonic Phantom Punch"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Cheeky!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, the moment I attacked the straw, the impact on the straw's jaw... I pulled my jaw instantaneously, so there's no particular problem... what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An attack from the blind spot?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right, such a big guy has nothing but a counter like this....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But it depends where I hit it....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Lagerman one... the counter?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Counter the shock waves from your fist to match the straw attack?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, did you do something? No major shock. Even if it's a hundred rounds, it's not crazy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, I'll let you in a thousand shots!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, I wanna cum again... eh, I wanna cum! I'm gonna crush you and rip you apart!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This one... you know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This stat gains a huge boost to Attack. Since the stride width is large, it is also faster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, because of this giant body, it is a big target for the opponent, and if it is attacked, it will hit quite a bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lagansonic flicker!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I wonder what happened to that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's definitely attacking with a straw's eye now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's not good. If you get attacked in your eyes and mouth, it hurts like straw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He knows that and he's fighting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll chop the flies out of your way! Disease-"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't keep my distance!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I tried to distract myself from the wind volcano... no, it was before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment he stepped into my distance, he was already circling ahead... as if he knew I was doing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're afraid of such a ragged wind volcano.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don't want him to activate the Windforest volcano?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhahaha, you can't tell me that the Rokkai under heaven can't win without it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's only been a few seconds since the start of the fight, but that's all I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He fights knowing what straw hates.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is supposed to be our first match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, you fight as if you know all about stray, and above all, you don't feel afraid or lost in its execution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suppose you are planning and implementing countermeasures from the straw information you have investigated, but you are so confident that you can "trust so much" about the countermeasures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I never thought I'd lose in the first place."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't have anything to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's much stronger and more troublesome than I originally thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it's... a little difficult to fight... that's all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sure he's not normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An unknown existence that uses forces similar to the Great Demon King's Breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those little moving feet and fists are pretty good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But with this much power and speed... than the Seven Braves...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, let's get together a little bit more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is still a quick plan to decide that the seven brave men are below...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He hasn't done his best yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all, he has something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the seven brave men, you feel something like a plus alpha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahaha, come on, come on, come on ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I was more interested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let's play some more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll take it all out and keep it for you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So don't break your heart soon, okay? It's Lagerman!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
