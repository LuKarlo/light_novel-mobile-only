 The battle style of Windforest Volcano… at first glance, it seems to have a good balance of speed, power, technique, defense, but it's not. There's a weakness. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My master is as reliable as ever when he fights against the corner of the Roku-ha who has a reputation in history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, the wind technique he often uses to attack cannot be used much when there are many allies around him, and even the enemy cannot use it without a certain amount of time. If the enemy is too close, it can damage itself. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hee......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, I'm vulnerable to super close combat."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the words put it, I walked around at Noja's feet without stopping, and on top of that, stayed a certain distance from Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, Noja can't tail attack me, and she can only strike with simple nails and crushes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These attacks are huge and not particularly powerful, such as feints or jabs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Holy cow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here it is! Lagansonics Mash!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nuoo
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were you now, I wouldn't have to make it, but I could actually hit the counter on top of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can put your fists all you want, no matter where it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I'm going to make a decision. His forest and mountain defenses are also used against devastating attacks such as giant magic and Hiro's magic sword... and his endurance is not as bad as a half-attack. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes. I'm pounding my fist pretty hard, but I don't think it's working that well for Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your body hair or something like a simple beast muscle doesn't resonate to your core.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Noja knows that too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahaha, you're going to play with me!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While laughing with Kera Kera, her eyes were serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's as if you're trying to observe everything while you're under attack from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. He must have been interested in your breakthroughs and simple movements and techniques... hunting you down and trying to pull a lot out. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja is not alarmed, but she doesn't think she can beat me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just like you're trying to get to know me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I target his eyes or something like that for proof, don't avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When this happens.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When this happens, it depends on when and where it hits the Great Demon Spiral."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heereereereereereereereereereereeree!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you don't activate a wind volcano, it doesn't make sense that my attack won't work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I'll have to knock on my greatest attack... the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it needs a little tame to activate, and above all, it's a big swing, so even if you hit it normally from the front, Noja avoids it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then how do you guess?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well then, it's settled. I have no choice but to punch him through the blind spot. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't do that....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The only way to do that is to let him create a gap."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "To do that... I dared to let him use the wind forest volcano."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you accidentally make a noise?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What does Traina say when she's using a lot of nerves, such as a sandy dance or a nail that's crushing the earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what's going on!? Let Noja use the wind volcano, even though we're in a close fight like this? What the hell is going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, I'm not letting you use Windforest volcanoes... when you show me a gap and Noja feels a chance to use Windforest volcanoes... the biggest gap will occur."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… ... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, keep avoiding it now and get used to his attacks and movements. If you can use the radar now, you can avoid it. On top of that, slowly calm your mind and listen to the rest of the story. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Treina said something that was inconsistent with her advice before she fought Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I don't know what you're talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't... even if I hit it right now, I might die, but I'll let a special attack like a more powerful wind forest volcano come out...? That's... pretty bad... even though I can't avoid it, it's still pretty bad right now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, considering that there's not a single shot of Noja's attack, I have to keep avoiding it while increasing my concentration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lagan Crossover Step!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't have time to get lost. Move around anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After predicting Noja's attack to the first hand, second hand, and third hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Use the radar to sharpen all nerves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... Nuu...... Nuu......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as the sound of a violent shock echoed, Noja's pleasant laughter gradually subsided.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Suddenly in a bad mood....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... it really doesn't hit me... it's an appetizer"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No. Was that a normal compliment?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu, the opponent is Rokuha. Regardless of race differences, if the opponent is strong, they will be properly evaluated. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what Trayna said, and Yamidiré and Palippi admitted to me while fighting somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Forget about me being Hiro's brave son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it's not just the Rokkai of this era.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, who is he?! Ah, I don't get it, I'm avoiding it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look at that typhoon of the boss... I'm not running away, I'm avoiding it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can do that powerful attack of the General... that mask...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amazonians watching the situation in a remote place were initially noisy like "do it", but their eyes were changing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rate me...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it... how come all the officials of the Demon King Army properly admit to myself...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ ─ It's just... isn't that right? In this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... ah......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna pointed me out, and I noticed that kid with a flashy look in a different place from the Amazonians, but his eyes were shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Um, it's twisting at the top of the Buddha, and that little monkey is staring at me and making my eyes shine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until then, let me...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides... if you forget, you'll have an angry daughter, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, and now I have an espionage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right... that's why...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll surprise you more anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, that's fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart, which was a little scared, began to want to do more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Apparel... but... I see."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the defense, Noja smiled again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's clean, and above all, it's rich in feints, foot rustling... insight into reading stray movements... it's amazing. But... that's not enough to beat the stray. It's not an attack force that is slapping me with a stray gap. And if you were on an unexpected level, you'd already know that. And yet, your pussy battle smells like you're aiming for something."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... cumming..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, there is, right? A Special Attack that deals damage to straw. But perhaps it's a turtle or a big swing, and it's hard to hit from the front. So you're trying to poke a stray gap somewhere to hit it, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once I stopped my hands and legs, Noja talked to me like I was good at something... but they found out... what I was aiming for...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu, the driftstone is a noja... wild conjecture, rich experience... I can't easily frame a solution... but I can't say that... well, it seems like this guy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like it's not going to be easy. Traina smiles bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What's gonna happen?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It has nothing to do with it. Don't stop your feet, boy. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, oh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm just observing how you move from there, how you react, how you react, and how you don't want to react by daring to talk about the other person's goals."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just observing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what does that mean...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja must have been more interested in you than I expected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm rather curious about... that era... Noja's obsession with Hiiro at that time... but showing such interest in Lagerman... is this based on historical reality... but it's not useless to think about it... hmm... well, good! Move, boy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
