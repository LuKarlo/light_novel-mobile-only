<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm putting so much effort into my fist that it's not going to work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even though it's a counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, it's not working...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shock wave counter that avoids the claws of both arms swinging around by a violent noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not working at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don't think Traina is particularly strange about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The counter must use the opponent's power. At the same time, beyond the opponent's expectations, who only thinks of an attack... shooting through his consciousness breaks the opponent's consciousness... and it creates a more effective counter. As it is now, Noja is predicting a counterpunch from the beginning, while he himself is releasing a shallow hand-stamped blow. That means you can't do your best. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, while Noja herself is making herself look as violent as she can be laughing like that, she's quite vigilant of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keep doing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, Noja's tactics are a big trick: just keep your eyes on the counter and hit me with one shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dodged the stack so that I wouldn't get hit once, and at some point, the Great Demon Spiral...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the sharpened sensation, I thought the next movement could not be read by the brilliant technique of foot judgment... but even in the step-by-step judgment of the feet, I can see the bias according to the situation ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bias? My step?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm starting to see how my pussy moves next... maybe it's only a matter of time before I catch you ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Be prepared when you get caught. First, how many hours do you lick it in your mouth? Afterwards, strip naked and pull out one by one... hahaha ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, this perverted fox!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of that was unexpected, and for a moment my body was stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're playing, Noja. But... it's still fine now, kid. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm as good at it as I was when I was pinching... something called a step or a mold that would take an aggressive step... the opponent is Rokkai. There's nothing you can do to see it through. With that in mind, the rest says it's okay!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I'm going to freak out for a second, my mentor will put me in that follow-on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh? Nh ~... when I thought my body was strong for a moment, I quickly switched my feelings and calmed down again... it was also a big mental thing... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, because Noja is watching my reaction with one stroke at a time, it makes me feel like Rokkai after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But one day...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's fine as it is, kid. This is a garment. Noja gradually gets used to your steps and movements... that's the goal. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The next move will somehow be readable... in other words, you just need to 'know how to read it'!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought so, I was already in the middle of a train with sophisticated tactics and maneuvers that I couldn't think of on my own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahaha, it's about time I figured it out... it's about time I finished playing with you!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here, kid! The right claw is shaken down from the diagonal top, avoiding it with a backstep, and Noja shakes the left claw immediately! From the steps he's taken, you stay back, step, stop, and from there, dash forward again - use the radar!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Holy cow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kita! Traina's right, she's coming down diagonally...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't let them escape!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I backed it up the moment I tried to avoid it. I dashed it forward again... and from there it was almost heartless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trainer instructions and radar sensing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like our feelings matched perfect, and I kept avoiding without stopping my feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just a few dozen seconds of events.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my point of view, it's a breathless offensive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, it's only natural that if I hit one shot, I'd take a lot of damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a tense atmosphere, I kept dodging dozens of Noja's blows in several steps soon after the interval....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nhihi ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, if I keep stuffing it like this... when I feel it in the foreword...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's it! Get out of here right now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, Noja's tail had been choking at Noja's feet just to keep her wind volcanoes and turtles from activating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The inner part of the time was the lifeline.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But come here and tell them to dare to run away from me when I've lost my escape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Doing so will activate Noja's Windforest Volcano.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, activate it! No escape, no escape from the distance I've kept... yes, Noja would think so!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Sogaa!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not if you're lost. I stay away from Noja's feet as if I were to distance myself from Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Noja's eyes glittered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's the distance I got!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At a certain distance, Noja can swing around like a whip without exploding herself with a powerful tail attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just waiting for it, Noja put the nine tails together....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Invasion..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's it, kid! This is the Great Demon Spiral! Isn't that the "over there" technique you used on Rosala?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahaha, come on, show it to me! Isn't this what you wanted? What do you want me to do? What..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's read by Noja too! You all right? You all right? No, but... we have to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... Lagan Giga Spiral!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what about...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My tail's up! And rigid! Now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Noja's face, which was laughing enormously, became stiff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even if you were thinking of what would happen if you could catch up, catch up, catch up, and catch up as you expected... you couldn't have predicted all this from the boulders... you were unconscious? Noja... I didn't expect this technique to be followed by a breakthrough..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than being surprised, it's as if you suspect "such an idiot..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, even if you activated and attacked with nothing, you would still be surprised to be able to evade it... but... if it was important to stay calm until the end if you caught up with the prey as you thought, you wanted to see what the child would see before you chased him down, but you didn't suppress your excitement... to some extent I assumed it would be unexpected... but was this technique completely out of your mind? And you don't know... the weakness of Windforest Volcano..."
</div>
