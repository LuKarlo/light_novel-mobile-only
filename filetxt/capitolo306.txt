<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The weakness of Windforest Volcano...... That means you can't do multiple moves at the same time. You can't defend the woods and mountains simultaneously while swinging your tail with wind and fire moves... in other words, Noja's Windforest Volcano can't integrate attack and defense. Offense and defense can't be activated unless they're switched... that's why the wind and fire attacks... especially if you can sneak through a special fire attack... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it would be enough for Trayna to smile and tell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's trying to put all his tails together over his head and shake them down like a giant hammer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But thanks to that, Noja doesn't have a tail to protect herself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid... impossible... that trick... its power!? What the hell!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, the activation of the Great Demon Helix surprised Noja herself and made her stiff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perfect preparation!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now that he's got his tail all over his head, he's usually hidden behind his tail, so he's completely unprotected! Even giant beasts, monsters, and dragons cannot be spared!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Work with Noja to smelt a hundred fights.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how much tail you use, you won't always be intact if you hit a strong man in battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Noja is rarely attacked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what's unfamiliar to Noja, if you ask me, Noja's weakness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here we go!! I won't tell you who I am wearing that!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja is stunned for the last few seconds!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Treina. Where the hell are we gonna put this in Noja?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eyes or mouth? Or are you hungry? The opponent is the Legendary Six Heights. I won't forgive you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what happens... no matter what happens to history... no matter what happens now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's it! Get behind Noja with Goose Steps!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oops!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dash through the stiff Noja's crotch and take the back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked up, all nine tails were raised above my head, so I was completely defenseless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shh... ahh, knock him into one spot!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooooooooo!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unfortunate Noja. I also took the back. There is no defense. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think about it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it moved as soon as I thought about Trainer's instructions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I flew while raising the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha!? Hehe? Hey, come on, you!? Nah, no way!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard a creepy voice from Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Traina's right, it's a real weakness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I won't forgive you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Traina told me, I looked at the defenseless point and saw the Great Demon Spiral.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, pierce it, yeah! Uh-oh... uh-oh... eh? Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... Yi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And don't stop, kid! Don't even think about it. Don't notice. Keep going!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, now... what..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? I'm flying right now... where am I going to put this big demon helix?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right in front of you... hmm? I usually hide behind my tail... huh? Oh, eh? Huh? Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kids! That part of the body that is usually covered with the tail of the fluffiness is for every creature... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, um, yeah. Okay, you know what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right ~, when I was a little pussy, it was like a thousand-year killer battle just for the walnuts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that's why it hurts, right? It must hurt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But do you want to slap the Great Demon Spiral in there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just imagined it, and now I'm squeezing my ass.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? I can't believe you're dealing with Rokuha. Are you sure? Is that an ant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, before that, Noja was just a slut... she was a woman, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right! In the first place, Noja is a human figure, and she looks like that criminal little girl, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I'm on that little girl's ass....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gu... no, no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bye, kid!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this moment, I felt more disgust than victory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reflexively, I stopped at the edge of the point I was aiming for -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, a flying ship appeared from beyond.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ship collided fiercely behind my demonic helix.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I boost my power by pushing the Great Demon Spiral many times more than usual, regardless of my will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like hitting a tonkotsu on a nail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ----------------------
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The force penetrated Noja's... completely defenseless... momentum from behind... certainly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nhhh, ahh... nhh, nhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!????"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" General!!!??? "" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the point where I couldn't knock with hesitation, the big demon helix is spinning... and spinning!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!???????????????
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that shocking moment, Amazones, who were watching from a remote place, shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I almost screamed myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was too egg.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha, ah, ahi, nhh, oh, nh, ah, ahi... â™¡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, Noja's whole body stretched out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Soon, however, his body could neither receive nor support him with his limbs, and as he convulsed, he pushed himself into the earth with a season and a huge noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ah, um... oh, sorry... no, I didn't mean to..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't worry... I won't let you die... the opponent is the Six Heights... if I don't do this much, you would have been killed on the contrary"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Behind Noja's face, I pulled myself out to the ground, and my hands trembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opponent is the Legendary Rokkai.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An opponent who doesn't need a Shard of Forgiveness to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But... this is... I accidentally apologized...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, from the ship that fell beside me, the girl flew straight to me, weeping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I'm wearing a mask, I seem to know exactly who I am.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh... eh, Espi"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, idiot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, whoa...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An espionage that jumps into my chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cried one by one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid, stupid, stupid!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why do you keep it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With both feet on my body, my chest is pounding again and again with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like you're pretty angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Er, Espi, it's not my fault, it's the enemy's magic...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan, don't get caught like that because you're strong! Why do you get caught? Baaah!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah... my... ah, where are the people?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I let you go somewhere safe immediately! I want to fly right away, but don't do it... uhh, idiot! Why are you fighting a bucket fox? If I'm a little late, onii-chan... uuuuu... uuuuuuuuu!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After the people who helped me properly are delivered to a safe place... I feel like a brave man around here, but I'm fighting the Roku-hachi, so it's going to be panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were dead....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'm sorry to bother you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhh, uhh... gushun... high, uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... you let everyone go... and you came to help me. Thank you, Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... um... gu... uu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a feeling of sorry and good work, I came here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't stop... I can't stop... I can't stop..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This... what do I do...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
