 "Ah, ahh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legends even appear in textbooks. The most powerful class I've ever had to kill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I can't believe you think "I'm sorry."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gyu ~ ~ ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Espi. Let's get out of here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I did it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsuka, look, before your very eyes, your rival Rokkaha...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... a lot of 'coming out'... little"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't tell me, Espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant beast falling right in front of you. I'm so sorry I can't explain anything else anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With my big demon helix and espionage, and... well... all sorts of...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 General!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my, human!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "How dare you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hate the Seven Heroes... Espi... and don't think you'll make it home alive, Lagerman!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the Amazonians raised their anger together from a remote place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of losing war when Noja, the general, fell down, he was motivated.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "They shut up....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I suddenly had an unpleasant face with a sweet mode espi in my arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Espi was pointing his palm at the Amazonians who were heading this way, not avenging the General...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahiii... hah!? Ah... kuriuuuuuuuuuuu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!?? "" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fallen Noja shouted desperately while not turning the rhythm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, come here, nhh, come here, you're not coming, ahhhh! Come on, nh, whoa, nh, nh, nh, nh, nh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breathless but desperate screams.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I guess so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This incontinence of Stream Stone right now, and even... no, well, I understand that you don't want your men to come to the misery of the earth, which is going to be a lot worse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, General, but! We can still fight..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, wait... Suha-suhah... gluuuuuuuuuuuuu"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuriuhhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh... I know... if you relax a little bit, it's gonna get worse... but no, I'm so sorry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Noja! Release and retreat the captive men!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, nh, nh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let's stop here, shall we?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu, I'm kidding... who do you think you are...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He crawled down and squatted, enduring everything, but Noja stared sharply at him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don't know what's going to happen... child. Your tone is back, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew you couldn't? I don't know, just a tone of voice... well, that's enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan, let's punish this one even more! With my fluffy panic..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! If you're a descendant, don't do it! But, more, more, more, more! It's going to be scattered with a big blast!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You son of a bitch, your warmth as a samurai... hah, well, if you yell at me again... my sphincter... fugoh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess so. If you do anything more, Noja may feel more humiliation than die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja, who would definitely want to avoid that, was crying with her angry expression.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Giggle, giggle... but there is..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Anyway... at least in the sea! In the ocean, yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it? What are you trying to say? I don't know if it's broken or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... that's what I'm talking about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, unlike me, who wasn't sure, Trayna nodded convincingly as if she understood everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja's request. Don't tell me the details of this battle. Noja raids the human city to take the men prisoner, but I want you to know that you got rid of them by engaging the Espi. A man named Lagerman wants to lie down. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The unknown mighty Raghan Man the Wizard King Army doesn't know... When you become a person with the power to cross the Rokkai, you have to report the style of battle and the state of battle in detail... If anything, you can magically read Noja's memories and share them with executives. If you do that, it means you don't want me to know about the big demon helix and all that stuff... well... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, I see.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, the battle report at that time also arrived because Espi and Noja had a skirmish and escaped prisoners and slayer, so I didn't get very detailed reports... Besides, even if it was a skirmish, I was confused by the ability of Espi during the mass prisoner transfer...... I see...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, history has not changed, and the truth about history that Traynor doesn't know is here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Six Heights has been killed for a thousand years and leaked... events that no one would ever want to know combined with all the twists...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, keep my mouth shut. Also keep the details of the battle secret. I want your men to remain silent, and the prisoners' men are unconscious, and I want you to leave the details aside so that the Espi can help the prisoners."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Crack, Crack, Crack."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja nodded with an incredible twitchy expression to my question with confirmation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, then, as far as I'm concerned, I wish I could.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, that's fine... when I appeared, you said pee in the ocean..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If anything but pee is going to be shabby, whoa, whoa!! Wow, wow, well, that genre is still just... ho, ho, hoaaaahhhh... uhh, I'm already bullying you... with that kind of eyes... ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, if that's what history is all about, then there's no reason for me to say no.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the back of Rokkaha heading towards the sea while crawling on his face, he wanted to show mercy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hang in there, Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? I don't know, but if oniichan wants you to do that, I will."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, here we go."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... ufu ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think deeply about the Espi, and without chasing after the six hegemons who were in a bad state in front of me, I was convinced that it was an assassin, and I slept with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, ngh... heh, heh... we're pulling out all our troops, so now we're leaving the prisoners here and going far away!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" What, General!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is an order, then ahhhhh, I'll swim in the ocean and meet you, so never come... ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Noja instructed his men to retreat and jumped straight into the sea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fugu, my dear... but that Espi is so nostalgic... so strong... Laganman... Lagan... Lagan? I see... this guy... how about this... oh, oh... I'll never forget this grudge... and... someday... let me... take responsibility!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Noja swimming away muttered something.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... that's what I'm talking about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina exhaled as deeply as she was convinced of everything, and I realized everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see... and then my father... ah, I see...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, they're gone...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, General's orders, retreat anyway!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All troops retreat! Leave the prisoners and retreat now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at that, the remaining Amazonians, without knowing the situation, were also instructed by Noja for the time being, raising the soot and smoke and retreating from the scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All that's left is the unconscious naked men... for now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are these guys okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think so."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, the enemy has left, and there is no danger anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well then, let's run like this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That should do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then they wake up, go back to the city, meet the residents, and let them do it themselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead, I ran with the espionage in my arms to avoid going too deep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya, are you okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, eh? Um...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, you're getting away too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh... eh? Wait... wait... wait!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then Slayer followed us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
