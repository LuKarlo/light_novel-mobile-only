<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from the plains, there is no sign of the Demon King army targeting us nearby.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Confirming that, I slowed down my running speed and took a breath.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu... I'm glad I managed."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without significantly influencing history, I managed to overcome the mystery with the legendary Rokkai and his army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sorry to hear about Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not good!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not good either!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, while I was relieved with everything, I didn't try to run or fly on my own, and only the luggage was brought floating, but the espionage that I held and stuck to was unbearable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniichan left me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I will never forgive you. I won't forgive you if you leave it. Do you understand?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I were a person of this age, I would have hugged you with a promise that I would never leave you again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn't do it, I just had to laugh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, you didn't have to say hello anymore? It seems that there were some Allied prisoners among them, and they looked familiar....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whatever. I'm not a coalition anymore."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, it seems that Espi fought Treina in the final showdown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why we're not stopping the Allies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about it, I get a chest ache for an espionage that's been betting on me so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How the hell am I supposed to leave Espi... alone...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the meantime, can we just get out of here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was relieved to look behind me and realized that Slaya, who was beside me, was staring at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you hurt, too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? Ah, yes... not... yeah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhahahaha, you've been a disaster too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was either educational or traumatic for the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm rather worried about the mental rather than the injury.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Um... Lagerman..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, you kept your mask on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll take off the mask I was wearing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... after all..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya nodded as soon as she was convinced, although she was a little surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought it was you who did the Espi and that foot judgment somehow..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hehe, mauna
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, Espi noticed me as soon as he wore a mask, but Slaya didn't.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Lagerman... that's your name..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, Lagerman wasn't really his name... well, I had to hide his name and face under a lot of circumstances."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn't that your real name? Things? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, the details are fine. Rather, there it is. There are a lot of guys in the world, but women aren't just like that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was thinking of following something, and all of a sudden Slayer made a loud and serious expression, so I thought it was something....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why did you... help me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What are you gonna do to help me? What are you trying to use it for?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is he talking about? On the other hand, there have been similar exchanges recently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, what is she saying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I'm saying the same thing you did a while ago!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides, if the kid was in front of me... and it was within my reach, I wouldn't have abandoned him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me, I'm not a child! I'm... I'm... a hunter... and I'm responsible for everything..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You look like you're about to spit blood out of regret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, unlike Nukunuk and me, who grew up without any inconvenience, I imagine I've had a pretty tough life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Listen, Slaya. Just remember this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to preach, but I wanted to say something to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You are Tse. Genius. That's for sure. But there are more amazing people in the world, including experience and talent, than you. I've always met someone stronger than myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... better than you...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, actually, I didn't kill Noja alone this time, and if Noja had been serious about killing me from the start, it wouldn't have been the same."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why we need to keep track of our strengths and circumstances. How strong are you now? What can I do? What can't I do? Then you will fight? Running away? Should I stick to how to win? Is it a life-threatening occasion? I know you are strong and talented, but you still can't make a judgment according to the situation about how strong you are against the other person's power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like a Boomerang who says something and returns it all to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina smiles beside you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, what are you doing... eh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha, you're right. That's why I'm still practicing. It's still immature... and stronger."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Listening to my words, Slaya is leaning and shaking with her fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan is strong enough ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's still strong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then... I'm getting stronger too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nooo... Espi is strong enough..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anger or remorse?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu... hm... I can't tell you who I am... even though I'm a person who's so tight... what...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, including yesterday's trick... if you regret it, let's make it stronger."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsuyo... ku..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not just frustrating, it feels like you're feeling something from my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Slaya was lying down with tearful eyes....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then... come on, you make me stronger!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me... you can make me a disciple... and make me stronger!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just a request. This is unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Pu, kukukukukukukukuku..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Treina. What are you laughing at?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, it's nothing... but... well, isn't that good?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, that's like when you train motuals with cocktails... how does it feel to learn by being on the teaching side?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... anyway, the journey from here is with him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you traveling with me? What do you mean by that? I did save Slaya, but....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, did you forget? You... know what they wanted you to do before you came to this age."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... ah......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know what it was for a moment, but I remembered it as soon as I thought about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right... then... that's right... that's right...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what are you saying? Oniichan is my brother, so I don't need any disciples!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't imagine the two children in front of me, but they did ask for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm still practicing too. I'm in the middle of being mentored by my master. I don't know how to take a disciple."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't be a master... but I can guide you... no... I can stay with you for a while."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ugh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I decided to make that wish come true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, are you going to be my apprentice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sorry about the monopolistic espionage, but this can't be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shi, Master!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no. Master, stop. That's not what I'm still called."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then... Mr. Lagerman..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, that's not my real name either...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, what should I call you....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... that's right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it has been a rubby and difficult kid, Slaya's eyes are shining like she's been kind of excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about it, I feel a little embarrassed.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bye... well... oniisan..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah... kawa... ah...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... what are you talking about?! Oniichan is my brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan! I'll take the luggage!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I'm about to be complimented! Oniichan, I have the luggage! It's easier to float."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I got it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya start a fight right in front of their eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at those two, I remember their wish again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Take it... I want you to aim for Sisonotami with me and Slaya. I know what you're saying. But that's what we want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Oniisan, I will meet you and travel to Sisonotami with you... that's our wish. I don't know anything about it... but I need you to lead us there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this all right? Espi... Slaya...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh dear... and yet, it's getting kind of busy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sure... I didn't know this was happening behind unfamiliar history."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever it is, my journey to Sisonotami is now "four."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shh... you guys are going to have dinner tonight... Curry!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yikes! Crispy ♪ Crispy ♪ Crispy ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is that right? I don't know... if that's what oniisan says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And once again, I cross this world of our time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
