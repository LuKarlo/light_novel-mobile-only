 - Making me something? Shall I cut off the filthy creature that seems to be used up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A long time ago. A onago that can also be said to be my youth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Destroy Shisonotami. The rest of my thoughts remain unchanged... instead, I will not force you to summon any kind of battle against humans. Farewell, my friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only best friend I've ever recognized with more power than I've ever had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - To insult men? Hmm, even though the war is over, I won't do such a childish thing forever. The current trend was not on the butt... Kohon, there is only one ambition. That guy's hands only let me cum with my butt... no, anyway! Let them take responsibility for making straw a scratch!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bad friend who enjoyed drinking with me. He's not dead, but he's been alienated for years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Help me, Dragon King of the Underworld. Well, I can't force it now. But our war is not over. Come see me again on the next day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The demon, who was once one of his rivals, still tried to resist without accepting the changes of the times, but I haven't seen him for years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I may be the one left unacceptable to the change of times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can't make a fool of a postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, this guy always leaves me behind.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow ~ ahh......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You must have fallen asleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it looks like you were fooling around with a slightly dull memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I look at the young people who live in a new era, I can't help but remember and compare and miss the era I was shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, it didn't look good. Nowahahaha, it's about time... can I go home as well?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As he opened his eyes, there were tired young men on both knees.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like you worked hard while I was asleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, shit...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't believe it... none of our attacks..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't like it at all... even though we were attacking the sleeping opponent all the time..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know... if I can't get one scratch..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I didn't know such creatures existed in this world....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is... the most powerful class in the world..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard that the kid and his wife also traveled with Hilua, and I met the young people when I thought I'd go back to the magical world soon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of them is the descendant of Kagya. Well, that's not so much, but when I talked a little, I kind of wanted you to practice with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was nervous and didn't like it very much, but I decided to do it at random.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, what we do is we use whatever means we can to hurt the eagle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the eagle casts magic on the scales of the whole body, and is in a fully defensive position covering the whole body with both wings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this state, the iron wall is better than the "mountain" of Noja's wind forest volcano, and even terra-class magic cannot hurt the eagle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, I knew there was nothing I could do about them now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, of course, they couldn't have surpassed my expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kh... not yet... not yet, please! We can still move! Would it be? Rival, hoo, Sadis, Macho, Sinov!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is a sense of upliftment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm a friend of that kid's, and some of the onagos seem to be in love with him... but anyway, if he doesn't leave me with that kid who's in the upper realm than we are, I'll use my eagle to hunt him down desperately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's where talent lies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma ~, I could hang out with you for a little longer... but it's pointless to do it like this? The eagle has not reached the minimum level that I can talk to each other by force. That's why I got tired of sleeping on the way, not interested."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They all wave within their expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "At least, there's nothing we can do today or tomorrow. The fact that that kid, your friend, gave more power than I expected was not such that the power that was conveniently hidden awakened. Probably blossomed with a pile of tips and tricks for quite some time. You guys don't have anything like that right now, do you? You seem to be training like a human being."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They can't do anything about the eagle, and above all, the flesh and blood of the eagle does not spring up. My soul doesn't tremble. No numbness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So in the end, I'm not free.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still... we can't end with setbacks like this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "At that end... we want to be more clear about our own challenges"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We can't do this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "First, not how to climb a steep mountain... first. We're still in that area."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I won't let Kuron be Honey's wife forever. That's why....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why. The Dragon King of the Underworld... please hang out a little longer."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, is it still broken?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only the fact that my stomach is enclosed is the salvation for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, okay, okay. I'll hang out with you a little longer. But I don't think you can do anything with your guts. You're just doing your best, aren't you? There was no ingenuity or trial or error. Now, all I have to do is use my strength to consolidate my body."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, my God. There's only one reason why I'm here...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though you say you don't care who your parents are, it's still a little.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah... I can't help it"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes... but still, Kagya's descendants... and the children of the brave men who beat Traina... I don't like them so much...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jesus Christ, I'm a bitch too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What I've learned so far... what I don't have is practical experience. Equivalent, a critical defense that is slightly more existential and less life-threatening than yourself... don't you have that experience? Normally, you can see the challenges after experiencing that. And that can't be done with a mock battle against an overrated opponent like me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We are aware of what you say. We have no serious experience with anyone like ourselves, and the only battle against the Six Heights of the Palippi... no, we've been so beaten up that we can't call it a battle..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess so. But if we don't do that, the shell won't break through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When that happens... we'll do a mock fight together..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aiya. There's no point in mock warfare. What we need is a serious match. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But that's....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know. That's why I'm going to teach you some interesting magic. Use it to start by 'imagining' the same powerful person you imagine and experience a serious match."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I decided to tell you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only magic he taught Traina once... when I cried drunk about Kaguya... that I should be comforted by a bitch...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's called fantasy magic, Voyage. I don't mind abusing it outside of training, and that's the flavor of it, but I'll make it a hodojodo ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
