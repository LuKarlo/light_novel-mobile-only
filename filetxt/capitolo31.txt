<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The worst day of my life, and at the same time the beginning of my new life goes back over ten years ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘I can’t leave this girl … at the institute. I’ll take her in!!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The heroine, who was called the War Maiden, hugged me tight as she said so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was still a young, fresh-thinking child, and I was terrified when the Demon King’s Army destroyed my village, my parents were killed in front of me, and that I would soon be dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, just as I was about to be killed, someone saved me at the last minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the seven heroes. Mamu, the War Maiden.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The one who saved me, hugged me and cried saying, ‘Sorry, I’m sorry I didn’t make it’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s not to blame for anything. She’s my lifesaver. Rather, I should thank you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I couldn’t accept the death of my parents, who I loved, and I just kept crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was saved. But my family is no longer here. The moment I knew that, I felt I was alone in this world, and I trembled at my solitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, she said, ‘Let’s stay together’ without handing me over, where war orphans were originally left in the care of the Empire or some orphanage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘I will be Sadiz’s family. So let’s stay together.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shed tears then and jumped into her chest. I’m not alone yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were not related by blood, but this entity that seemed like an elder sister or a mother, saved me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She didn’t let me go even after the war. She lived with me as if it was only natural to live together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘I won’t get married until Sadiz is of age. If you can’t wait until then, I can’t marry Hiro. Marry someone else.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone wanted to marry Mamu, the War Maiden, and Hiro, the Great Hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were still two teenagers, a young couple, but with no one opposed to their marriage, everyone approved at the time, yet she gave priority to me who was still young.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made me glad, but I felt guilty, and I wanted her to be happy. I don’t want you to put your happiness on hold for my sake anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, and I consulted with Sir Hiro, and as a result, it was decided that I would continue living with them as the adopted child of two married people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was reluctant to live with two newlyweds who didn’t share blood, but she…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Huh? Don’t be silly! You’re our family! You live with me! That is the decision! Otherwise, I’ll drop the marriage!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shed tears again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s where our lives began.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, life with only three people ended unexpectedly early.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Hey, Sadiz. You want to hold him? He’s… our new family?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A new budding life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Small, soft, delicate enough to break, but when you hold it up, it’s heavy, warm, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Uh, he cried when I he was in my arms, but when Sadiz held him, he stopped crying!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That life squeezed the fingers that I held out……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Egu, Ee… Ni~’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Huh!? ‘
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The baby had a broad smile on its face and was laughing… I loved it unconditionally from the bottom of my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll protect this child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s mine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s my family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not going to give it to anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a young child, I felt it was my mission to continue to protect this child for the rest of my life, not to give back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ever since then, me and the baby were firmly attached.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Hey~, Sadiz~, let me hold Earth too~.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘No. Master is clumsy. Sadiz is best for the little man.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Uh-oh, just a bit, just a little, just a little bit~.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘No good. I’ll not hand over Little man. Master will not be forgiven for making Little man cry.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was more a monopoly rather than attachment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Gah, once you mess up with Sadiz, it’s over. I’m also concerned about Earth’s future. Earth seems to love Sadiz, too.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Little man~, nuzzle-nuzzle~’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Kya, Kyao’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘See, Earth also loves Sadiz.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Mufufu~♪, Little man, it’s my boob naughty. Yes, you are~.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Kya’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Excuse me! You can’t just leave yet!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m happy every day that I get to raise and love my Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Little man, who was so thoughtful, was so cute, and grew up with a lot of vim and vigor…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Thaddith, you know, you know, i’ll be Thadis, Be Bride.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Little man. If you say that, you’ll be my honorable wife. But, that’s how we’ll do it then~.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘U~, na-na-, Sadith- is my bride~!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Oh, you’re a crybaby, aren’t you~? I don’t want anyone to be a crybaby’s bride~’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man also really loves me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Sadiz… you got into the academy…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Yeah.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Then… anymore, means you can’t play…… not much…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man seems lonely and a bit sour… So cute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that day…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Sadiz… Umm…… Congratulations on your graduation from the Academy…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Well, Little man. Thank you very much. Nice bouquet…… I’m so happy.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Yeah…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Oh, what’s going on? Why so down… are you feeling well?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘…… Umm…… Sadiz graduated and became a warrior and became a grownup… Sadiz…… Are you leaving?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the day of my Academy Graduation Ceremony, he gave me a bouquet of flowers bought with his pocket money. He was only 11 years old.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a lonely face as he asked about my circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, until I’m a full-fledged adult…… That’s how I thought my path would go… However, when I looked into Little man’s teary eyes, I made up my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘No, I’m not going anywhere, am I? I’ll always be with Lil’ Earth.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Really! All right!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I had a nosebleed… Well not, yes, anyway, instead of becoming an 【Imperial Knight】, I became Little man’s exclusive maid while retaining only the qualification.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, Little man back then…… so unfair!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Sadiz~, let’s pla… eh.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Oh, just a minute, Little man. I’m changing right now…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One day, he happened to see me changing clothes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m in my underwear and I’m blushing… he’s awkwardly looking as I flutter… That’s right, the moment of sexual awakening for Little man! Drooling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Flickering… Ah… Sadiz…… sorry.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘No. Rather, if you’re apologizing, don’t look at me, okay? This topic is still too early for Little man.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man. My cute boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since then, I’ve found that the Little man gradually became interested in ‘things like that’ and became a boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m tactless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I occasionally think I’m just a troublesome woman that I get sick of it at times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how to respond to the cute, loving little boy’s feelings towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, I play moderately mean tricks on him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For example……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Kya, pervy breeze-, my~ skirt~ will get turned up~ (Little man)’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Heh, Sadiz! …… That?’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Ufu♡ Ufufufufufufu, aw~, that was dangerous. Under the skirt… If wore panties… instead of these shorts, you could have seen them. It was in full view.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘~~~~eh’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Ooh? Hey, hey, heeey~! What’s wrong~ Little man~? Was that arousing? Hey, hey, hey. I must report this to the Madam. Naughty~ Little man~♡’’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Damnit, Sadiz you dummy!’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sullen face. A tearful face. No matter what your emotions, they will hit me with the true feelings of the boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Every time I feel it, I can’t be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m special to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to be here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Fufufu, sorry, Little man♪.’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am a happy person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately after I realized, I certainly was unhappy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lost my beloved parents in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’ve already forgotten that tragic past-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -[Continental Collapse Magic] is it… The absurdity of the magical city to envision the fall of the demon world with such excessive force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -The work you reside over can no longer be pardoned… As such, I shall destroy you myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, what did I… I looked too far back into the past. I want to seal it deep in my memory. Until the past I want to erase…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only worry is that, when you reminisce on your happy days, you may also bring back the trauma of the past, which is naturally bitter and painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 —Great Demon Spiral. Devil Spiral-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Memories of my childhood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, a huge tornado-like swirl hit my hometown as the Demon Army invaded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Most humans were engulfed in the swirl, their whole bodies were cut into pieces, and thousands of pieces of human flesh and blood rain fell across the country.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment when they were hoisted and torn apart in the sky is still vivid!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!? Li… tle man? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What’s up, Sadiz. With a scary face…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no. It’s nothing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I did. I still have a long way to go. I didn’t even realize that Little man was back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was saved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just remembering that day darkens my mind and makes me feel overwhelming fear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The doctor said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder, but I haven’t yet been able to overcome it after more than a decade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, Little man… you bought a lot of books… Even if it’s a camouflage to mislead an ero-book…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t mess around”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my, really…hm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I felt something strange in Little man’s eyes when he came back, like ‘He has sharp eyes’ or ‘his eyes are tired or twitchy’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He may have come back from reading a novel somewhere, but it’s obvious that his eyes are clearly tired from reading a book?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the heck…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Li… Oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then. A sudden wind blew without any forerunner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had the exquisite force to sweep up the dust and fallen leaves that were being cleaned, and to fly my scarf which had loosened its knot but is not harmful to the human body, and to roll up the skirt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Girl’s called this wind, the so-called pervy breeze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s exactly the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t! I’m also washing my clothes, so today I’m only wearing cheap, childish kitty panties…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Inside out, the content of my skirt that has turned up is out in the open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no way that Little man could not immediately see them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as I thought that Little man would be looking at my kitty panties, or such a thing, he jumped and caught my scarf that was about to be blown away by the wind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, good catch. Here, Sadiz.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh, ah, umm, th-thank you very much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Little man hands the scarf to me with a proud face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was puzzled by that figure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Idiot… Even if they were childish cheap panties, did Little man not notice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, he would have ‘ignored anything else around me’ and ‘only had eyes for my panties’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why then?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I… I’ll be reading a book in my room before dinner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y-yes. I understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so, Little man returned to his room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On that back, for a moment I felt a Gentleman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since he started declaring victory in the [Graduation Commemorative Match], has something changed with Little man?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The results of Magical Speed Reading… It was brief, but it’s scary. I also got a sudden photo opportunity… The amount of dust and leaves scattered… also putting the scarf that flew into perspective… Permanently stored in the brain! The navel, the legs, …those, and a slightly embarrassed face all at once… I can use this for the rest of my life.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, recently, Little man has been talking to himself a bit more often.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
