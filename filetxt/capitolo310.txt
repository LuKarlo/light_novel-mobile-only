<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think I kept it at least in public all the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My little boy has been the strongest and cutest in the world since he was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, I was an angel when I was young.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I restrained myself from eating... but from letting my emotions wash my hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Boy is an important family to me, and he is the son of my greatly grateful husband and wife.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the future, as the successor of a fine brave man... even if I think of it now, it was a future that ignored your feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, I'm a maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Boy serves the Lord.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Occasional jerks were also kept close to the line so as not to exceed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's only a real story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sadis... I... want to take a bath with you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, of course ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I'd never come back to my old Boy's Archangel days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before you acquire sexual knowledge. But when I was old enough to be excited about women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the spacious bath of the mansion, we often took a bath together to clean up the baby's body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this time, I wonder how many times I was about to do something I shouldn't do at the same time as being happy.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ufufufufu, take off the shroud, ribbon and button, slowly lower the skirt, and show the standard white frill panties and bra to the boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, the kid... is delusional, but his face turns red and tickles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I beg such a boy, I have never done this before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boy. Could you... remove the bra's hook?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah? Yeah? Oh, me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, uhhh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ufufufufu, please, little one. Come on, let's go."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little trembling fingertip, but still confused, reaching out to my bra hook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's amazing. In reality, nosebleeds and yogurt don't stop.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Er, ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ahn ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It faithfully reproduces what I imagined it would be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When my fingertips touch my back a little and I raise my ticklish voice, I rush to pull my fingers in and make you look sorry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, it's perfect even for a delicate delusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nandemo Alimasen, kid. Come on, do your best."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-huh, uh, mm-hmm... like this? Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, thank you ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My cheeks, cheeks, the moment you took off your hook and looked back and thanked me, my breasts were cluttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fuuuuu, that's so fucking cute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, that's fine. No matter what you do, no matter what you do!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boy, are you okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh, ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, apparently the stimulus is too strong for the boy. However, this is the knowledge you need... to study health and physical education in the bath today ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ho, keh, ah, ah, ah, ah, Sadis, pa, pa, pa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's embarrassing... but, boy, look carefully. Right? Come closer..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phew... I can't stand it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh, Sadis, oh, I'm weird, my body... is sick?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, that's tough ♡ Whoa... nh, nh. Boy, let me see it better. Come on, don't hide it with your hands, more grandiose... ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, no, no, Sadis..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Boy ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Archangel. Thank you for being born in this world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I'll take it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hah... noble ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Exactly, don't stop. Don't stop. It's a bundle ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew... maybe I've entered an invincible spiritual mode somehow."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've gone through a single overwhelming delusion, and I've sort of calmed down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking about it, I've been having a hard time mentally for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sin of being a boy in the game in front of you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Days to chase the boy from there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Days at Cacletail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Settling with Boy from there is also a complicated affair against the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My helplessness felt in the battle against the Sky Clan and the Palippi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was the only one who could see off the traveling boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the days when I was anxious to be strong under the Dragon King of the Underworld.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe those days were getting rid of me sometime.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's missing is not only combat experience... what I probably needed was more calm... I don't think I've been replenishing the emotional stability ingredients in the Empire's room in the last few months..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more nervously I was chased down, the more impatient I was, the less effective it was, and the less I wanted it to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then maybe it didn't work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But with this magic, you can comfort yourself at any time with your self... and I've been flushed with all sorts of things. I think I can hope for a lot of things now. I've been taught... good magic."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of the rush to "get stronger and faster" as before, there is a growing willingness to "do it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might be able to do anything now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhahahaha... Thadis, can you catch me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the kid in your game who was created by delusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, we must be able to catch the boy who jumped out of the Empire at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, I'll get you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Try it. If I catch you, I'll make you cute on the bed."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... uhhh... this delusion is different. Boy doesn't say this kind of line because there's something horrible about it. Instead, I'll give you a lovely bubble bubble... Okay, let's go."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, Devil Swabb!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here we go!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And one day, I'll definitely catch up with a real kid... yes, with the world in mind, even if something happens...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
