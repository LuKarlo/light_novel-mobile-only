 a couple wearing a tuxedo and a pure white wedding dress in front of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two are about to become 'couples' now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blessed by many, they smile happily at their center.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ever since I was a kid, I thought I was standing there in that dress.

 I can only see it.

 "Th... uhh..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despair enough to destroy the sight in front of you... despair enough to smash your head... what despair...

 In addition...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, honey! Isn't it terrible just the three of you? We need Saskatchewan and Sakura to make us happy!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden, I think it's just... earth, which normally accepts it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly cheating in front of you? That's not true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You guys... I'll make you happy."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 It's exactly a friendly 'family'.

 And....

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh boy, it's so hot. But there's a lot of things you can't do when you're pregnant with Kuron or Sinov, who is tired of raising children. Then please feel free to use me here."

 "Ah, oh, hey...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh dear, no matter how old you are, it's ugly ♪"

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I've always wanted, to be seen by Earth as a "woman."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The gaze has never been directed at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, it's the first night of my honeymoon, so I naturally joined the fight today! It's okay, there's something you can do while you're pregnant!

 "Ufufufu, don't underestimate me because I'm a midwife. I'm going to hustle you today ♡"

 And in it, I... I...

 "Uhhhhhhhhhh!!!! This delusion... can't be made real! I... I will never forgive this possible future!! I can't give up! I can't give up on this!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, I screamed from the bottom of my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, hah, hah... my... what a nightmare... I've imagined nothing but... magical fantasy, Voyage... don't be afraid."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're in a dream, but you're breaking your heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your whole body is exhausted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think I could faithfully reproduce my delusions so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And... this is not something to be truncated as a mere delusion..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is delusional. But it's not impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Harlem may have gone too far, but someone inside may be standing next to Earth in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can wear a wedding dress and be a couple with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was happy when I gave birth to Earthchild and became a family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ground wants you to be a woman, and you can flirt with her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not strange that one of those three should be Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't do anything, I'm just a loser outside of a mosquito net... that's not impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Instead of impossible... at the moment, it's more likely..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is the future that could become the established route as it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, who had a funny assumption from a young age that I knew each other with love and love, I should always assume the worst.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the worst.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Worst future... huh... I'm ugly too... Besides, it's one of the happiest futures for Earth... Worst for me... just for me... don't make me laugh at all, Fiancay. After all, I only think about myself... for a long time..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without even blessing Earth's happiness, he shouted that it was unhappiness and despair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When you look at yourself again, you understand how stupid you are.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well done, I thought I was in love with Earth myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's why....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm still... disappointed in myself... if it's over..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will try to resist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really. Seriously. And polish yourself again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I swore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --It's a partition change. As a princess, as a warrior, as a woman... I will... strive for higher heights... so that I will not lose to you who will jump into the world and live freely. From this moment on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I first confronted Earth in the sky....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh? Earth, that guy... he's scared. They're trying to take away our happiness....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, what's the use of losing heroin to make us happy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't have time to play with the princess. We must now eat spicy food and prepare for the night. Today, I'm going to ask the children to do it quickly, Boy... ufufufu ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until recently, when the girls in my class seemed to like Earth a little bit, I was anxious to do things that showed exclusiveness or that made Earth look bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But not from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not taking away the groom... but will you fight me? I don't know the power of Kron, so I can't... the synov with the power closer to my present self... and a stronger Thadis than my present self..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One day, you will polish everything so that you can be seen as one woman.
