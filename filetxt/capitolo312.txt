 "Saskatchewan and Sakura don't want to go to the academy."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know you have complicated feelings about the academy. But I think the title of graduating from the Academy will be useful for any future journey."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nothing like that, you should think about it when you two grow up. I dropped out of the academy, too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But since I grew up, I'd rather regret 'If I'd gone to the academy then...'"

 In the tenth year of marriage, the conversation between husband and wife centers on the children they love.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Saskatchewan, and Sakura. Do they have future dreams?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Strong and cool, like Dad!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-san, no! And the flower shop!

 For my part, I still want my children to progress to the Imperial Warrior Academy so they can crush in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I myself graduated from the Ninja Academy in Japone at the top, but the Ninja Warrior had a painful career experience. However, I was lucky to jump out of the country and meet my beloved Honey... but anywhere in the world, I would like to give my children the title of graduating from the Imperial Warrior Academy, which will help them go any way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? You don't have to think about all the competition like an academy right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honey, on the other hand, is not obsessed with that. Children may go on a normal path. Only if you can grow up healthy and kind to others and have the guts to work on it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I agree with that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But other things.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right... but my neighbor is already preparing for an exam war. We've never been ready for war before. Otherwise, I can't fight because I'm not ready to fight."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My thoughts and Honey's thoughts will collide.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... I guess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I wonder if this is going to happen. Honey seems to spoil the kid a lot somehow....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, not just happiness, but the delusion that couples share opinions about the future of their children... not dreams... no, a simulation of happy family planning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fantastic magic Voyage taught by Basara, the Dragon King of the Underworld. It's really great.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both magic and ninja have the same roots, so even I've never learned magic before, I could activate it this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This will also enable me to plan for future conjugal problems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I'm still not sure that Honey will choose or like me instead of Mr. Kron and Mr. Thaddeus.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my ambition is not for Honey to like me more than the two of us. Because that's just hypothetical.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My ambition is to build a happy family. And to make honey and her children feel happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I do image training for that time because I sometimes bump into something on the way to building that happiness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, couples aren't just flirting couples.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honey comes home from work, greets me with a naked apron, turns my back to the kitchen... ahn â™¡... and the Endurance Kids Making Festival all night long is not the only thing that couples do. Of course, that's why I came with Don....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, sometimes couples need to feel free to collide with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's just... something I can't predict at the moment... what kind of job Honey will be in the future... as long as I hear about Honey's past, he may never return to the empire he ran away from or become an Empire Warrior again..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that case, no matter how much I think graduating from the Imperial Academy would be better for my children, Honey would still be uncomfortable, and perhaps our place of residence in the future would not be the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not so bad to live in Honey and Japone... but I don't know how you can see me... even though Kojiro-sama might welcome me with a smile..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I can reproduce in my dreams what I thought only in my head until now, I became even more worried about the future than the result.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if this is a marriage-blue?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "After all, maybe it's not bad to be an adventurer or a hunter in your family and raise children while traveling around the world... hmm? Oh?... hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't think straight, and I suddenly reopened it and said something I had come up with... but it was...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That might be nice!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, I thought that might not be bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In fact, Honey won't be able to put his roots down in one place for a while, and he'll be around the world... but raising a child while he travels... yeah, I can give you a lot of experience. Besides, it might be a lot worse for me and Honey to learn, fight, and learn than to send them to the academy. Honey seems to be good at teaching people things... as long as we listen to Motriage..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be a little dangerous, and I'm worried that my income may not be stable, but it's also an option for the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Raising young children on a journey... I wonder... how happy it could be. How does Honey feel about this idea of mine? Would you like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All right, then, if we don't do that simulation right away... that's not it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If I'm going to live like that... I can't help but pull my legs out of that life... I still really need to upgrade myself. Not just ahead, but now my own level-up....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it's not just a simulation that's going to last forever, but I also need to step up to the right number of places and prepare for the coming future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Save your happy troubles for a moment....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "First Princess Fiancay... brother... and then Honey, who defeated me when we first met in the woods... let's fight! After that, we'll have to fight in image training with Honey, Palippi and Kojiro-sama!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll make sure to stand next to Honey for the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait, honey... yeah, you. And my beloved children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
