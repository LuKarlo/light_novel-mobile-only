<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I encountered a fierce herd of firestorms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Spit fire out of the sky and burn the forest, shaking its sharp nails and teeth to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used to think it was big, agile, and really tough...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The power is not comparable to Aka-san, the speed is slower than mine, and the way to fight is all monotonous... the power of the flame that comes out is less than hoo... after seeing the roses above all... I see... this is the Fire Dragon..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now it's like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fluffy panic! Okay, it's the third one!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Northern Cross Shooting Star! I'm the third!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's it now... the Fire Dragon will be more pathetic...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Sonic Smash!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, after all, it's a wild firedragon. I'm not smart enough, I'm not at the same level... and I'm not going to be with you or Espi or Slaya right now. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I stunned the dragon with a fist shock wave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only dragon I've ever encountered is Basala the Dragon King of the Underworld, so when compared to this... it's not comparable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, no... Hu and Rival were attacked by a herd of firedragons while they were studying abroad, so they looked terrible... well, here's what I'm going to do."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Three! I win!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me too, I killed three!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was heading for Shisonotami, I saw that I had encountered a fire dragon nest in the deep forest, and the fire dragons that I noticed attacked us all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Traina was right, because she wasn't intelligent, and she didn't know what she was capable of, so she went back to clams with me, Espi, and Slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, yes, both of you. Come here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mu ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mum ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I only took down one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya have been struggling with everything in the past few days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think you guys should get along because you're getting married in the future.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... you didn't kill either of them, right? We were the ones who tried to cross their nest."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, I just stunned her."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We don't destroy ecosystems in the dark. Hunter basics. But that means... if you take down this many firedragons, you'll get a fair reward at the city's money changer, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'm not in trouble with the money... it's a horse..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right. Oni-chan, you got a lot of money from your horse. When Slaya wasn't here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this way, I will properly follow my instructions other than "get along", so, well, perhaps it is to endure the bad relationship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, it's okay to say yes, right? Here, touch!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yay!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... ahhhh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Our journey continued while the three of us were hitting on each other with joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But a few days after crossing the plains from Genkan into the mountains... it's still a long way to Sisonotami ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While forgiving the little one who is about to quarrel in a slightly distracted gap, he sees a vast forest visible from the top of the mountain and confirms that it is still far from his destination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This means that this journey will continue for some time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, that's right. To get to Sisonotami... look at my map. This is where we are now, and in a couple of days, there's a little bigger city, Ikkanay City, and we have to go through it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, more camping....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, but with this much forest, there will be beasts, fruits and wild grass to eat, so it's no problem. Well... you can still make Carrie, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, yeah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slayer removes the map from the luggage and spreads it. Speaking of kids, there are boulder hunters around here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't have a map either, so I'm glad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Has Slaya ever been to the city of Ikkanay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A few times. There's a lot of work going on over there. Monster crusades, ecological surveys, Mafia... and elf entanglements... just ask me anything."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, thank you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I accidentally pounded Slaya's head again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, until a few days ago, this guy was like, "Will you stop? I feel like it was an attitude, but now I accept it normally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... fufufu"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mhh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes I smile like I'm proud of the Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oniichan. I'll get there sooner if I'm a fluffy flight."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, I'm not in such a hurry...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Espi also sticks together like a confrontational consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Flying... that's certainly an ant...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well then it won't be any training... these mountains and forests are perfect for camping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And since I also have camp training, I will refrain from such a little cheating because of my master's advice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I'm a little worried about getting more trouble for the little ones who aren't close.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhh... oniichan, aren't you tired? I'll slip your shoulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, bruise! Oniisan... aren't you tired? I'll give you a massage."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... muu, I'll do it! Don't fuck with me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm better because I'm stronger!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bhuu ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, we're not close, this might make them similar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, this kind of scene has happened several times before....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, until then. The fight is over. I can see the river over there, and we can camp there today. It's Callie."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, yeah! Kallie! I'll find something for dessert!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Curry... okay, oniisan. I'll start the fire today!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, no matter how many times they fought, they ended up forgetting the fight in Curry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't be afraid, Carrie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know, these guys are getting too hard on Carrie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if you think about the leopard thing that happened when we met these two in modern times, when Carrie was involved, you don't have to know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fufu. The original curry devised by the rest of us is wonderful. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina is proudly looking "fufu" as if she's happy somewhere. Well, I like it, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sure it'll take quite a few days, but it won't be such a difficult journey to Sisonotami in this state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Well, that's true. After all, I've heard that the city of Ikkanay was under the umbrella of the Bokmates family, but after all, it's a secondary to tertiary group class... especially if something doesn't happen, it won't be enough for children today to be alert."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my mate... connected"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna didn't deny my words as she looked at the back of Espi and Slaya, who ran out to compete with them all because Carrie couldn't wait.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's around Shisonotami that tightens my mind. Around there, the Demon King Army and the Allied Army are nearby. I slipped into the eyes of both armies and managed to reach the deepest part of the ruins..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we get there... we can go back to modern times...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Return to the modern era. That is the purpose of this journey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, that means I'm leaving....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, hurry up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, what are you talking about?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With these two... that's all you have to do... but until then... and when the time comes...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
