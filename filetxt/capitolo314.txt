 Cross the mountains, through the woods, and even through nature.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some of them were attacked by fierce beasts and monsters along the way, but they were polite and there was no particular problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hey, oniichan... that's it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... in the camp..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the way through the woods, I found traces of what appears to have been a camp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After the firewood, the food wreckage, obviously human... no...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, look at me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was some garbage on the ground, but I found a small bag in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the bag was something I knew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Calorie friends....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a portable meal given to a Demon King Army soldier that Trayna once developed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was at Slaya's store in the future... which means I bought it in my own time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there are other people in this era besides me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course that's....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Demon King Army....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's all I had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess. Besides, I told you last night... Maybe there were dozens of Demon Kings around here last night... that's what I mean... but there's no manners left to clean up after the camp. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what Trayna says, I'm sure of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I try to explore the surroundings on the radar, but I don't feel that close.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if the opponent is not a monster, the Demon King Army will need a lot of vigilance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Demon King Army? Oniisan, why do you think this is just dropping?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Because it's for the Demon King army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I answered Slaya's question slowly, didn't I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, is that so!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why would oniisan do that? Oniisan is a human, not an army of demons, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm surprised at Espi... no... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's... convenient. In some circumstances, I fought against the Demon King Army, but I myself have no resentment or hatred against the Demon King Army, and even if I did... I have nothing to do with culture or technology. Accepting flexibility is the trick to growth."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I'm proud to say something to nature... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Pu, kukukukukuku
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina's smiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Traina told me the same thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't believe you taught Traina not only Slaya, but also the Seven Heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right... because oniichan says so!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Flexibly... or... accept what you should accept without preconceptions... Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And these are good boys! Glittering eyes and respectful eyes... No, it's the word of the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not to mention... it's more troublesome to encounter the Demon King army than the monsters..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, maybe it's part of Noja's retreat. Without joining the main unit, people who are acting differently for perimeter surveys and mapping. However, I didn't pay particular attention to this area, so I don't have any other memory of ordering an invasion around here. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, but you're not near the enemy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Certainly, there are disturbing signs....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I may have been here last night, but the problem is....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly someone got caught in my radar net.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan?... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? There's a sign...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's a little late for me, and he's picking up Espy and Slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something is approaching us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Multiple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, slowly killing the signs like sneaking up.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ten... no, twenty-five... they're slowly scattering around us."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the forest is deep and you can't see it, you can see the whole thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opponent's height and muscle mass... are fairly thin, but tight... they are quite able to move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A mix of men and women?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can feel the magic there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You have a weapon... in this shape... a bow. He's carrying a sword."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, that's right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, Slaya... be ready to move."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe the Amazonians the other day?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I don't feel like losing. But I'm not ready to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, what do we do...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... wait, child"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You must have felt it too. Not just a woman... but a mix of men "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There are only women in the Amazon army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna pointed out that I was upset too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, all Noja's men were women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fact that men are mixed... doesn't mean... then who is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --- What are you doing in this forest... you don't look dirty... people...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ----I don't look like I'm lost with an innocent child...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A slightly harsh scolding voice echoes through the forest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Young man?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ----Cohon. Ah... this forest is our sanctuary. I will not allow it to be filthy or desecrated. You may leave early. Otherwise, judgment in the wood--
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops! I'm not going to do anything extra, so I'm leaving early, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Oh, oh... is that so?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ---... I see...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, let's avoid rubbing things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, when I returned the voice that I had heard, the Lord of the Voice showed a slightly mesmerizing reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you sure? Oniichan"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, leave..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it was the Demon King army, it would be horrible, and even if it wasn't, I wouldn't fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I'm taking you both with me.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, no, chief! Why are you trying to miss Assari!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I mean, I'm leaving....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --It could be as dangerous as the Dark Elves of the Demon King Army captured yesterday!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --But he's human.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Only humans can be trusted! Remember the organization that kidnapped and traded our people?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --This is a child.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, except for the kid, the man we're with is at least blind! I'm sure he's a bad guy! Maybe that's what's taking two kids!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --My eyes... look scary... those three... they're so strong!? Yesterday, why are you doing this for two days in a row...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --What are you freaking out about! You're still the chief! You're strong!? Let me give you a hammer of justice in the woods! You're stronger than that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, no matter how you look at them, they're stronger. Look, a few days ago, the firedragons in the mountains ran into me crying, but maybe they...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you have any of your buddies?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Initially it was a mysterious voice echoing through the woods, but now it's completely rubbing aloud with just my friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sorry I didn't look so good...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bad guy?... about oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan... bad guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi? Slaya?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I will not tolerate oniichan's bad words!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this way, the two people who usually rubbed together were in agreement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
