<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can avoid a useless struggle, it's beyond that--
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ursanai!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let me correct it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the next moment, two little ones pop out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm gonna jump out of you guys! Stop!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the child can't stop suddenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, this isn't good...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? My child looks amazing....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, stand by!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a ferocious look you look like... humans are barbarians after all!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someone in the woods is holding a weapon and targeting Espi and Slaya from a medium range.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watch out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not the two of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come out! Fluffy Fishing!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!???
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, someone is in danger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They also fished invisible fish at the bottom of the ocean and rescued residents in Genkan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care what happens to people who are at a distance where they can hear their voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And someone came out of the bushes of the woods into space.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Young man and woman. Looks like some kind of hunter wearing green-toned clothes....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, suddenly!? What did that kid do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is this... magic? Me, shoot that kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I heard upset voices from other people hiding in this situation, but at the next moment, I closed my words as if I had lost consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What are you going to do when you're hiding? Not to mention the fact that I'm against a hunter... I'm completely retarded."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can see Slayer disappearing from front of me and raiding people one after the other while moving fast through the woods to stun them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya-kun, you're cheating on yourself!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "These guys made fun of my brother... I can't stand it anymore."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!? It's my brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you've become my brother..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm cuter! Oniichan, I've been hugged and naked!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me too, Nadenade... hasn't hugged me yet... no! When Noja attacked me, when she saved me, I was hugged! That's why it's Even."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Muki! Even though I'm the only one... my strong and cool oniichan hugged me... oniichan also did Niko, and all the scary and nasty things disappeared."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... I know what that is... powerful... warm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! That's it! It is, isn't it? I don't care what happens when you do that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah. That's why I have to work harder...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right! I'll try harder and get compliments too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Look, I don't know who these people are, but this is what happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hih, what is it!? What's going on? What's going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "One by one, we're all being beaten!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, these two!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't argue with the two of you normally while fighting. And go around and get along, you guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm? What?... I just realized... these people..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... that? Hey oniichan. These people....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Espi and Slaya, who were arguing, noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's about someone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll see who the Espi caught up with again.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I realized something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... it's more barbarian to put out a weapon just by seeing a child running angrily... and you can't win back... you know, that girl... is psychokinesis... that boy is a genius... hah... no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, a man jumped out of the tree with a sigh and appeared before us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, back off!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From a glance, it clearly emits air that is different from the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't feel the muscle mass or the magic that seems to be intrinsic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But something's different. That's a hunch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I was screaming when I realized...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Please don't."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come out and sit down immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, both of them finally stopped, even if I stopped them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Chieftain!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this was unexpected to us, but apparently to this man's people, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hear a sigh from the woods.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really, we're just hickeys in the woods, so please don't be ridiculous. No, it was me who attacked you, so I'll prepare everything from apologies to money and treasures! I'm really, really stubborn and lacking in common sense, so I'm sorry they're even more annoying than just idiots!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He rubbed his forehead against the ground, whether he was a child or not, and begged for his life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think it would be strange to call him a pathetic man...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... um... well, then, I'm sorry I said that to oniichan so badly..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I will. No, rather than being kidnapped, I'm sorry that I'm a hollow Bonkra race who can't see the truth about being admired for mess."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The stray stone and the espionage have also faded, and the momentary anger just now has faded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the man who raised his face.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He wasn't human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, oniichan, this guy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Black hair covers only one eye, and the only eyes that are revealed are thicker, the neighborhood is visible, and it looks kind of rotten.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though you have such a dark face, your whole body feels natural with a green tone. Is it a gap or is it not suitable for you...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But young. Even if you don't look the same age as me... no, the elf is definitely a long-lived species, maybe not as old as it looks?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, apart from that, the first thing to draw is that the man's ears are sharp and pointed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Demon race...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I accidentally associated myself with the Demon race, but the atmosphere is somehow different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the trainer next to me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's not... it's an elf..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Elfu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elves... I've seen Dark Elves before, but I've never seen Elves before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the young man and woman that Espi just caught out of the woods are still elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I knew it was an elf... and I was surprised along the way..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya came back a little surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that's just unusual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I often hear the slander of a wise man in the forest, a wise man, or a fairy, and I hear it in the story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the dark elves from the demonic world, there is not such a bad image from the human side, but rather people who yearn for and seek the beautiful appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, now that the number is considerably lower... I don't think I've ever been in a war before... such a lowly elf?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chief, what are you doing?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't you have the pride of our proud Elves!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You don't think there's anything you can do with all these people!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But shortly afterwards, many elves jumped out of the trees and bushes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beautiful gold and silver-dyed hair and neutral appearance... which means the man is handsome. Women are beautiful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, this is it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These are exactly the kind of elves that jumped out of a picture book.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, didn't I just make sure that pride didn't get weird? He's a kid, right? You don't look like the Demon King Army, you don't look like those bokumates... and yet you have a bow on your child... and you're being clawed..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why all of a sudden, your head is down and you're under the ground. What a disgrace! Why do we lower our heads to the inferior humans! And our Elf chief! What are you going to tell 'ma'am'!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know, when I touched that twitchy little lady and Miss Mendokusai getting married to me on their own... on their own, right? Instead, I want to raise my voice in protest against the fact that everybody wants to lower their head to me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's too crunchy! I mean, if the lady asks you that, you'll be blown away! I mean, please don't do this because we'll be beaten up too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now, everyone listen to me a little bit. I think it's more worthwhile in the world to be an idiot to just listen to a story than to a wise man who doesn't listen to people."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, what is this situation?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly appearing elves arguing with each other?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what's up, oniichan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... I'm not mad at you anymore... let's just get out of the way..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, if that's all right...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why we asked you to do it on your own...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, I know that the famous Seven Brave Men in the city were tragically defeated by the Hakuki of the Demon King Army, and the Allies were almost destroyed, and the Brave Hiro was in serious danger and the situation was terrible, so I felt tingling...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, our feet stopped unexpectedly in response to the chief's sighing muttering words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm... that's right. Well, I didn't die after all... and besides, the irrational thing about rising from the abyss of death and powering it up... I mean, what would you do if you were an espionage?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, that's right......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina was right, I wasn't surprised... No, I was surprised... but my very existence proves that I don't have to worry about my father's life or death, so just...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then please be more critical to your chiefs! I don't care how many humans die, but if the entire earthly world is invaded by the demons..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Idiot, in a way, I'm concerned about the situation on the top of the Elves. If I destroy a human, I'll lose my Distinguished Series income. It saddens the reader."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again! You don't need that! Don't even disguise yourself and go to the human world to sell such things, you... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hurry....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!!???
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Trainer went crazy with an unusual mess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
