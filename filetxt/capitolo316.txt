<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The legendary book that even Great Demon King Traina loved to read... it's no longer true. To say the least, Trainer's personality is so excited that it collapses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I, I, I, I, I, I'm not staying right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... I told you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elves appeared before us. One of them has a different air, a man called the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What an interesting thing about that guy, Traina, and I've been read... but... the author of that book?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... um..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, yes, something! No, I'm sorry I rubbed it a little! I'll sort it out, so please be calm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... are you... the writer and teacher of the Distinguished Series?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... fu?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, the chief is Pocahontas... but his face immediately turned red...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?! Ah, you, eh? Oh, my pepper, huh? Yeah, why? Yeah, yeah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This reaction... is it real?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bye, stupid! Wasn't the original author of that novel a human!? Oh, my God... the rest of us are forever human... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina didn't know either. I mean, me too... in the future emperor's capital, it's a mess and a boom, a card with pictures of the attached characters... a demonic commercial technique that says it's not unusual to buy many books by yourself to attract any character because it's random... it's not a human, but an elf...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, it's supposed to waaaahhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, such a great teacher squatted with his hands over his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's really bad to see readers in real life! Whoa, no, no, no! Don't be disappointed! Don't look at me like this, because I'm producing that impressive line or that cool line!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, um... Sensei?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gyaaaaahh, stop it! Stop it! Don't say anything about a teacher! Never call me a pen name! No, please give me a break in everything!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, eh? Yeah, yeah, yeah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, I rolled with my head in my arms. Why? How could you be such a shy man to produce such an interesting piece?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, do you know him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Distiny Series... What is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other elves are poking, and Espi and Slaya are tilting their necks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You two don't know each other? Or is it still famous in this age?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait a minute! No, yeah, it's weird!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the chief suddenly stood up and stuck his gaze at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're human, right? How old are you?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... fifteen years old..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I knew it... because my work is a naughty scene, I still can't buy it at the bookstore when I'm 15!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah... speaking of which...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh-huh, that's right. The Distinguished Series of this era had an age limit because humans had less negative effects on children than freedom of expression..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it is. What I bought was a full age version that came out later... so...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey oniichan. What is it? What is it? What's the matter with you? Is oniichan your favorite book? I want to read it too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan, I'm interested too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I certainly shouldn't have read them yet....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Did you really read my novel?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief stares at me with suspicion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't help it. Even though I'm being stigmatized as a porn kid...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Cohon... ahh... it looks like my friend's brother had it, and I read it through it... it's called Owna Niest... ahh, it's nice to be a knight or a magician!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Especially the farewell scene with the Knight Woman....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... my friend... no, God reader."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Thank you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lied to you at first, and then I meant it. Actually, I thought it was interesting, so I told her. Then the chief shook my hand with his face.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, I'm glad. Yeah, yeah. It was embarrassing, but someone who was reading it properly told me about my work... ah, well, I'm so happy and excited about the first time..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah... ah, junior..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah! Yeah!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like you're in a good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nimmari nodded with a smile....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow, cheating! Cheating, kid! Let me tell you something else. Yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't get excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Listen to me! Reading the sequel didn't solve my doubts!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ok, ok, ok.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I was exhilarated with the chief, Traina stuck to me half crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that book, I'll forget myself, laughing at Trainer.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think the original personality of ● ● ● ● in that scene would be that kind of development, but what does that mean? There's a contradiction....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I asked Traina's questions, the chief suddenly calmed down....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... don't close the corner of the heavy box... I realized later that there was nothing I could do... ahh, there it is... that's how I'm going to poke it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, um, ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, ah, that's... hey, kid! Apologize for the rest! Chi, I didn't mean to blame you, but I was just wondering... ah, kid, that scene, that scene, that scene, that scene, that scene, that scene, that scene!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, well, forget it! I like the 2000 scene too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!? Ooh, I put a lot of effort into that scene... oh, I love it there!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seemed to have touched things that should not be touched, and at first he followed the depressed chieftain in haste and regained his mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trainer's in a hurry and relieved state, and he's so excited about the boulders....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That scene was the next underlying line, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, I didn't expect you to realize that intent... tears..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "and ● ● and ● ● ●, but in fact ● ● …"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! That's cuter!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I realized that the chief had opened his heart to me.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Um, chief! Don't get along with humans..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're still talking, but be quiet!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, hah, eh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, already! I want to talk to you more... I want to talk to you! All right, everybody go home first! I'm talking a little bit more here, and if anything happens, I'll stay in the wilderness here today."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, you've opened your heart already... I don't think there's a race wall anymore...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, chief, what are you talking about!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, I can't invite you to the settlement... because your reaction itself proves how the inhabitants react, and it makes me rude and uncomfortable... so I'll talk here alone, get forgiven, and then I'll apologize for the treasure..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, do whatever you want! You can't leave the chief alone! I don't know what your wife will say....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, if they say something without doing anything, they'll do something and say something. I mean, I don't have to go home, sometimes I think I'm lucky."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, but...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the elves rubbing in a different direction than before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result of the argument, we were invited after being promised that we would never talk about elf settlements outside, not to mention snatching them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
