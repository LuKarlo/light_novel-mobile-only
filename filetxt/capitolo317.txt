<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Deep woods. Troublesome directions to go through without a path.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's probably a route that travelers who cross the mountain normally don't get there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, after going through a route that would never have been reached.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a small settlement of forest fairies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Elf Village... oh, there's an elf over there... there's a little kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I've never seen it before."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me too. I can't believe it was here.... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was like getting lost in a fairy tale world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Young, beautiful looking elves live discreetly in the woods in symbiosis with nature.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Okay, let's go. I'll invite you to my house."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... but just for now, are you sure?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, we are not very welcome or alert, and anxious elves are listening to us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It feels like other armed elves, other than chiefs, are ready to move at any time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chief... are you all right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's okay. Leave the rest to me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah... just call me right away if you need anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, yes."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, we're invited to the chief's house.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the chief walked in the middle of the settlement and smiled at us as if he was sorry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'm really sorry...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, it's not like you should apologize..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Especially these days... there are a few other elf settlements out here, but they're raided and grabbed, and they're all on guard..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I listened to the chief, the reaction of the inhabitants was rather natural, and I didn't feel that the chief had changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The bokumates family....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, you're famous among humans, aren't you? He leaps into the back of society, he's also involved in human trafficking... and he's connected to the Hakuki of the Demon King Army."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember a casino in Canteen where I met Bro and fought with the towels.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All that chest shit has been connected since this era.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I've been at war with the Dark Elves of the Demon King Army lately... and he's rampaging us alone to let the others escape... For now, he's holding them and putting them in jail, but they're all tingling."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Demon King Army..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, there was also an argument between the chief and the other elves earlier. There were a lot of surprises and I lost the story... but the Dark Elves of the Demon King Army...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He was one of Noja's men."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... it's very likely..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dark elf woman who was in a skirmish with Noja the other day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I arrived at a wooden house, thinking it might be that woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... I live with my wife... but it's a bit difficult to persuade her to do something about it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there's too much to talk about, but this chief is married.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She looks about my age, but how old are you actually?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The daughter of the former chief... I'm not good with people, my personality is always twitching, I'm cool, I'm flabbergasted, and I'm very prideful... but my roots aren't bad..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Former chief... ahh... so now you're the chief..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... I'm just leaving..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does your wife's name say "ethee"?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if he's as prideful as... fiancée...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief slowly opened the door by announcing his return home in front of the door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there it is....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, you're back! Kohon... nh... nh! You're back! Ah, ah, it's too late, so I'm stubbornly turning into a pumpy cat!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -----------------------!!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A young woman with peachy hair about the length of her shoulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But with a face darker and brighter red than that peach hair, why on top of my head are bras and pants made of cat ears, fur... a cat's tail on the bottom of my pants... a choker with bells... and... gloves in the shape of a cat's hand?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Giggle, giggle, today... today is full of cuteness! It's so sweet! If you don't do it, I'll scratch you because I love you so much ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a very cute appearance, it is not a Nice Buddy with big tits like Sadis, but it is a standard undulating body, but still a beautiful appearance unique to elves and an unclean body (?) So I work hard and dress sexy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Pumping makes my body burn... and I'm getting itchy thinking about you, mistress... * giggle *, nada *... and then I'm going to listen to everything you say, hey, I'm going to be a little lewd and good cat..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, rather than being taken away by that sexiness... Nandacole? The idea was stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With rice... until morning, I'll eat too... nh ♡, uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with your face bright red, it looks like a cat's hand... posing like a cat? The woman who had stopped with her eyes closed eventually opened her eyes unbearably in the silence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, say something! I'm working so hard for this husband I came back safely. Besides, it's not like I really want you to be cute, but today just happens to be ovulation day, so don't get me wrong... huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the woman who made up some sort of hidden word at once noticed us behind the chief, and it solidified again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... wow... I want to stay..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief of the dragged face revealed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah. What? What is this painful woman?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I'll come back... hah ~..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief closes the open door once. Then squat with your head in my arms.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, Nh, Nh, Nh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard a crazy voice of a woman in the house.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain, yes, that was!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Young lady... that's your wife's voice!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me, humans! What did you just do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The voice echoed through the village to the boulders, and other elves quickly gathered in a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Please... it's nothing... it's my family's problem, so just leave me alone... or my wife will die of shame if they find out about this..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we didn't do anything... for now, it took me a little while to get you inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
