<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what do you mean you're suddenly taking customers home? I didn't ask you anything. And a human being....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the living room, she changed to "ordinary clothes", glanced at us slightly smoothly, and mouthed at the cup containing tea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You've become a great son-in-law... and an absolute leader from the standpoint of chief?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... that's not true..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not to mention welcoming people? I can't believe the proud Elves welcome the inferior humans..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the wife of the chief, Ethe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what was that cat you saw earlier?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bhu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eate sprays tea on innocent espionage questions and hits her head on the table.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Espi. That question is correct, but it's wrong... don't ask..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The espionage is a jiotong expression that I really don't understand. On the other hand, Slaya drinks cool tea and never touches it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm really embarrassed... I'm sorry to show you something painful..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief also apologizes for his wife's ugliness when she looks very tired. But his wife was furious at the words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hit the van and the table.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, that's nothing... I just thought I'd do something you might like from time to time!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Why do you think I like something so cold and painful?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, because! There are so many cute girls coming out of the novels that I always write... I didn't like that kind of stuff, so I made you nervous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? I didn't put out that character. I mean, in the first place, it's effective because an innocent girl does it, and the woman who calculates it is no longer painful through the bruise."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha? How dare you! Nh, I'm getting annoyed!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you mean, it's a weird couple... or should we stay here in the first place?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, chiefs don't say hard things either. You told Bollocks that a woman who couldn't be honest while illuminating did her best to get her attention.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that an innocent girl... for example, in the case of Thaddeus...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ufufufu, if you're not cute today, I won't forgive you, little one ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm... it's not bad... it feels like a bullshit cat... well, it certainly feels uncomfortable...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Honey... no, master. "If you don't adore this synov cat, I'll smell it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe the synov will do it if you ask me, but it's a little rough... and I think it's uncomfortable, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, when I say innocent, Klon...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ----Nyah, earth ~, you haven't bothered me lately, so I'm stubborn. Ufufufu, today I'm going to be a cat and I'm going to be sweet to earth ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ufufu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... wow... you are..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yabba, you're so excited... so cute. No, I might have hugged her in my imagination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron is natural. I mean, the chief is right. Shizuishi is a writer teacher.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if Kuron asks you to do it, you won't look like you hate me... oh no... then maybe I won't be able to control myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Nyah, the earth's cheeky cheeky cheeky cheeky cheeky ~ ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --But Kuron Cat is really terrible... please punish him...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bad, bad, bad. I'm thinking about perverts in people's homes and next to Espi and Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah ~ But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So... hey, there's someone there! I've been looking so weird for a while now... what the hell are you guys!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, hey, don't ignore me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you listening!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yabeye. I was so used to the paranoid world that I didn't realize that the wife of the chief was talking to me at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, hah, yes. What is it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ".......................................... ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Buho."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... ah... oh... I bit...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chi, chi, chi, that was a mistake...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu... fufufufufu... it seems that my husband has brought some very insignificant guests..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm no longer talking about killing those eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, the chief seemed to be rattled and trembled on the table.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Pukukukukukuku, just calm down... ethee"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up! Basically, why do you do whatever you want without consulting me every time! Not just this time, you can execute the Dark Elves, but you can put them in jail to see how they're doing, erase their memories, and offer to let them go!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ehhhhhhh? Even if I talk to you, you won't listen to me...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? That's not true! If you're serious, I'll ask... what do you think of me?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... Sekaiichi Ichitellyo"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here we go again. Besides, I love the chief with no heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, so, so, uhh... then... I'm stupid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you sure you want it now? After all, the chief is also the chief, but this wife is also strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This may be the form of a couple but....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew... more than that, the child... that dark elf..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... that's right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I need to ask you about something that bothers you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, chief. I was a little worried about that dark elf...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, from the Demon King Army. It's okay. I can't get out on my own because I've sealed up my magic and put it in jail. We're discussing the treatment... I told you to kill everybody, but I don't really..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if it's the Dark Elves I met in Genkan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't fight so hard, and I didn't have any reason.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be strange for me to talk about the treatment.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, I'm going to welcome these guys and discuss my work today! I want you to put up with it all night long."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?! Hey, now... hey, today... ovulation... what's the deal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, eh? What are you saying in front of your guests... and their children? Pull. Amazing pull. Pull"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know what's going on..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I'm stubborn. I mean, I knew that my wife liked Mendokusai chief for the time being.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if the chief is too dull....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shit, come here, you guys."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then his wife, who was reluctantly going into the back of the room, called out Espi and Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't let the kids stay up late... and you guys smell a little. Didn't you take too many baths?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? I'm taking a bath... and washing in the river..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, no, no, no! Here, come on. I'll boil the water, so wash it properly!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bath? Bath! Yeah, I'm in! Oniichan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let's get you in first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? I'm good!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What are you so embarrassed about? Come on, come in with me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm a boy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? So what's the matter?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It looks like they're about to take a bath by accident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That appearance only looked like a noisy, painful woman just now, but it didn't seem like a kind of quiet, caring mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides, you don't want our house to get dirty or smelly, so don't get me wrong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn't seem to change that I'm not being honest...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahaha... you've done a terrible thing to the elder's wife."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, nothing..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... aren't you gentle?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "He said something about divorce, but you're not satisfied either...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw the wife of the chief forcing Espi and Slaya into the back of the house, I laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the chief didn't particularly deny my words....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's a marriage I don't want to marry, and I want to travel the world to find stories about honest novels. But... I can't deny that in the current situation, I'm so concerned that I can't do it without him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yabeye. I don't know how hard this is to understand anymore....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The chief is a mendacious man."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Men are only alive, so they're standard."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, why are you smiling...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Between ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the two of them were all dry, and on the contrary, I wondered if they suited me just right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan is fifteen, right? Speaking of human fifteen, it's the age of puberty, making a painful black history... doesn't oniisan have that kind of love?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me? I...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He asked me if the chief was going to fight back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the sheikh's question was just a lot to me, and I laughed bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Indeed... even in love... there may be a stack of painful black historical relationships..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... heh... you don't have to tell me because I don't want to dig up people's coibanas that much. Recently, I just heard a heavy coivana....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, instead of pursuing me deeply, the chief would hold his head about what he remembered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I told you earlier, the dark elf I'm catching... it's heavy... it's not directly related to you... to avenge my first love with a dead childhood friend..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee... that sort of thing... well... there are wars like that... but it's definitely heavy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think it is definitely heavy. But still, I tried not to think deeply there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There will be many such things in this world of our time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why some of them have the same thoughts from the human side, and some of them have been killed by that dark elf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I'm not involved... that's what I thought...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, no heavy talk. Come to my room! Actually, there are plots to be made in the future, and if anything, I'd like your opinion....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ooh ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuoooooooooooo, is that true?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna has been so happy about the mess for a long time, and I've been trying not to think so much about the Dark Elves at this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn't realize that at this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That dark elf doesn't exist for me to say... "It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter at all"...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
