<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Talk with the chief all night long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina was so excited that she asked me to speak for her, and the chief also knocked, and when she realized that the outside was bright, she turned pale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From there, I completely lost consciousness, but it woke me up suddenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh! It's an espionage! Oniichan, get outta here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ehehe, onii-chan... gu ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sudden impact on the stomach. This is.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, what are you doing?! Damn it... oniisan, it's morning... it's time to get up."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And you're shaken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something, I've only slept for a moment....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, eat your breakfast now. I made it for you personally, my elder wife, to thank you for eating it. I won't forgive you if you leave."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following Espi and Slaya, my wife gave me a huge frying pan and balls, and when I woke up rubbing my sleepy eyes, I smelled a good appetite.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking out of the room, there were soups lined up on the dining table with bacon eggs and salads prepared for us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Good morning, oniichan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good morning, oniisan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, did you sleep well?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, Slaya (Espi) didn't sleep well, but... hmm"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike me, I was given a bath last night, and I was able to sleep soundly in a house with a roof for a long time, and both of you look very refreshed... and suddenly, don't look at each other in a mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry I slept with you, Slaya! Because when I woke up in the morning, Slaya's feet were in front of my face!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know what you're talking about... you just turned a lot upside down. I slept well."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mmm! Slaya!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, you slept in the same bed yesterday... are you close or not... or are you getting married...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, don't bother before breakfast, let's have it properly! I made it so hard, it's gonna get cold!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There it is... why did you come to me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the sleepy wife slapped them lightly on the head, angry with them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You two hold your head, but you don't speak any louder, so your wife won't be able to raise her head overnight?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, I baked some bread."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow! Oniichan, look, look, bread! Mr. Yete has been cooking since the morning. It looks delicious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, don't tell me you've been in such a good mood since this morning. I just wanted to relieve the stress because I was kind of upset from yesterday!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hot bread.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was kind of fresh because of the camp life and the fact that it was not so far from this family breakfast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi seems happy, and Slaya is cool, but she's not in a bad mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, no... hmm? Ah, I like it ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu ~ ~ ~ nn
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't say anything that feels like I'm usually loose! Sit down, too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, sir.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the words of the chief who woke up, it seems that your wife was very pleased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, you're not being honest about everything... huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, 'yours' bun"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, we doubted our eyes by accident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breakfast served in front of the chief. Bread. And salad and soup.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's no bacon or sausage like us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than us.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, chief...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Does that fill your stomach?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Less than us. When I think about it strangely, the chief and wife laugh bitterly.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I'm... a herbivorous elf. I don't eat meat."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't believe you don't eat vegetables and meat... that's why the lines are so thin...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? What is it... that Trayna, who was so haggard last night and made me speak for herself, looks a little difficult?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Something caught in the current flow....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you like it or not, you can't grow up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it doesn't grow rapidly if you eat something you don't like, and the limit of human beings is fixed. In the first place, the size of the body is very meaningless except for those who live in battle, so it is my conclusion that if you eat only what you like, your life will be richer."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh?... I don't know what you're talking about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't listen, Espi. This guy is a pain in the ass who twists and twists reason."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... and then I got married..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Slaya! Hey, I married you! I had to marry you, so don't get me wrong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Isn't that why you got married?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Su, su, ah, ah, that's why... um... it's nothing like that, su, because I like it... but I can't just get married! There are so many things! Kids might not know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, at this time, Traina's condition quickly disappeared from her head, and she got excited in the morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... I don't know... do you understand oniichan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bu, oh, me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I was here... I was surprised and sprayed tea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without even knowing how I feel, Espi runs into innocent questions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In contrast, I....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, well, look... that's it. Marriage isn't about being a lover, it's about being a family... ah... it's not just about feeling each other... for example, getting recognized by each other's families... or being blessed..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I don't either. Traina looks stunned... huh? Speaking of which, I'm talking on my own right now, but I think I heard it somewhere... ah... speaking of which...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... that's right."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know, but oniisan is an adult after all."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hee, I heard you're still 15, but you don't really understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought it was defective, but unexpectedly pure... is it good to grow up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm impressed, but Espi... Slaya... ah, I see... I can't believe they've been saying what I'm saying... for years...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain, oh, my God, Chieftain!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then... I heard a noisy voice outside the house early this morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With his head tilted, the chief rose to his seat, opened the window and appeared outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the young elves with the weapons that attacked us yesterday changed their bloodlines....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The firedragons that rushed in the other day... came again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, see you later?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides, you're really hurt! Go check on him as soon as possible. It looks like he's suing us for something, but we don't know... come on! Maybe something's going on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fire Dragon? That's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did we fight back the other day...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, maybe not you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A few days ago, when the Fire Dragons came running in weeping... it was probably because of you... I think it was something else, not you... ahh... Mendocai..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what the chief said, sucking bread into his mouth and leaving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn't that us?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it... what are you trying to do in the morning?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
