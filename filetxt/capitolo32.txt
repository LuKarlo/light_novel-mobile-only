<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speed ​​reading changed my perspective on things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than ever, I became more conscious of ‘seeing with my eyes’, and the results my efforts were tangible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I see…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant orc appears in the world of 【Vier】, swinging its huge arms at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you eat this raw, you’ll definitely get sick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Everything seems to stop.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been sparring with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Agility acquired.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore, the magic technique that dramatically raises physical ability……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Of course. Small fry are no match, dispatch the rabble, and parade yourself!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dive into the bosom of the giant orc and slam my fist into its liver.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The orc reacts in agony as it goes down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next is a skeleton warrior, and then a great serpent. In addition, Gremlins.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it was a dream, it was my first time fighting monsters, but I’ve already sparred with the Great Demon King many times, and I’m not afraid of anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, all that has been generated is equal to lower-rank human level warriors. As your skills were intermediate level even before my guidance, you ought not to find them a challenge.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly there is no struggle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, just as Tre’ainar said, if I only spar with superior partners, I’d be unable to realize the image of defeating my opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this way, by fighting an opponent without struggle, you have more flexibility during the battle, more options at every moment, and the leeway to experiment and attempt fighting styles you haven’t tried before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh. Pay attention to your footwork, from no guard… tilt the upper body with [Great Demon Swayback]…… then with [Great Demon Parrying] strike and throw off the opponent’s fist…… I believe this improves your defense.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual, the naming is sh*t, but I don’t care anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now, I’m probably improving enough to absorb a lot of things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, next, I bait the opponent’s attack and at the last minute… here!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jump into the opponent’s linear attack and drive your fist to cross it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… [Great Demon Cross Counter]…… tis quite sharp I suppose.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is a dream. However, the feeling left in the fist, the feeling of shell being broken is real.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Simply, I felt that I was getting stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「All right, tis still rough, but the [Great Demon Fighting Art] is gradually improving.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I see. …… Phew…… But my eyes are tired…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A compliment from Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is not one to flatter or say anything eccentric.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He speaks only the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, because he praised me, I had ‘such a feeling’, I was genuinely happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the sensation of the eyes becoming tired even in the dream is mysterious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But the results are apparent. The combination of Speed Reading and 【Canonicon】 allows the six muscles that control the functions of the eye… the superior rectus muscle, the inferior rectus, the external rectus, the internal rectus, the superior oblique, and the inferior oblique, to be trained…… this sparring after improving dynamic vision, peripheral vision, and brain processing.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh… ‘Magical Shutter Eye’…… I didn’t think it would be so tiring.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I trained my eyes with speed reading, and even with sparring, I did eye-conscious training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is sparring while using 【Canonicon】 continuously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Precisely. 【Canonicon】stores the viewpoint into the brain as a picture after observing it once. However, the scenery before you is seen in the paused state for that moment alone. Therefore, if you use 【Canonicon】 during combat, even if the scenery seems paused, it actually is moving, so at the next moment you will be aware the world after a split second.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「At first, I didn’t understand the explanation very well, but… in the middle of battle, the moment the opponent’s punch is about to be released, I close my eyes with a blink and shut off all visual information, and the next moment I open my eyes, it feels like the fist already in front of me. It makes it difficult to catch movement…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sparring opponent is not Tre’ainar, but lower-level monsters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Against them, I can blink and cut off visual information over and over again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「So dynamic vision and reaction speed that may act immediately after the shutter opens. In addition, from the picture of the moment you turn off the shutter, the opponent’s movement, line of sight, position, state of the entire body in the peripheral field of view, and the world in the next split second can be predicted and appropriate action taken… Reading Power…… Not only simple reflexes, but also dynamic vision, peripheral vision, and the power of prediction. That is crucial.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In combat, taking your eyes off your opponent or letting your guard down for a moment can lead to defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Magical Shutter Eye, the uses of this 【Canonicon】 continuously while sparring, is meant to train it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, even though the opponent is such a low-level monster, defeating it in this way is considerably tiring. But in this way, being able to defeat them without taking damage leads to confidence. Well, this is just a dream…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「All right, you have been training in your sleep. After today’s academy sessions, we shall perform ‘Magical Shutter Eye Phantom Sparring’ as well as 【Vier】 battle simulations.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sparring in 【Vier】 in addition to monsters like now… Well, considering the situation… Hmm, to embody the sword, and do so by imitating the swordsman of the seven heroes of the past?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu! Wha…… you don’t mean, to say it without hesitation, but that’s Rebal’s father!? What can I possibly do?!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tis possible. Emulating the skills and movements of the opponent after observing them once was among powers of the six-gate eye. Well, if you get accustomed to the Sword Saint’s power from those days, your childhood friend, ‘The Sword Saint’s Successor’, will not prove much of an opponent.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, really, to you… anything is an ant. As long as I can count on you…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Of course. However, that will be after school. Now tis time you return to reality, perform some stretches and light shadow spar before heading for the academy.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a while, the effect after sparring with lower-level monsters felt very satisfying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I’m here, I want to do more. I want to fight more. The desire to become stronger also grows.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there is a limit to things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There might be such a meaning, too. With Tre’ainar, anything he does has purpose, nothing seems pointless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still have time, but now I guess it’s all right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Phew~… Even so, something like a style is emerging.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「At last, you have come to understand how to use your body, and even began to follow what you envision in your mind.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. I now understand how to use my fist. Even though it’s a reality in my imagination, it gives me confidence that I can defeat orcs with just my fists as a handicap.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that, I woke up in the morning, stretched and shadowed lightly and went to the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was growing, and I was curious about something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Speaking of, Tre’ainar.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「You’ve been providing orcs and a lot of other things for me to beat up, but… as the Great Demon King, this is what human beings do, does it upset you?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It just fought the monsters embodied by Tre’ainar’s imagination, but they were demons, those who once followed Tre’ainar, so to speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wondered if I should ask after beating them, but I was a little curious, so I asked him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… Not really.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh! And Tre’ainar replied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As a human, do you still not witness killing and confrontations amongst yourselves? Tis a similar matter to the upcoming game.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sure…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Much less, tis more exhilarating to beat up those you dislike, is it not? Same as that. After being bundled under the same category as ‘Demons’, once the lid is opened you will find tis finely diversified. That the entirety of demonic races are considered as one tribe is detestable.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if formally, the previous ruler was quite pragmatic on the matter, rather unsentimental…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I as well… if someone I cared for got hurt or killed, I doubt I would remain silent.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this way, he’s the kind of guy who’s willing to keep up my discipline.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess in some parts we are not so different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I see…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In that sense, the demon world after my death… tis probably a lawless zone, but I am a little concerned.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar was staring a little into the distance, I felt his heartrending feelings were conveyed at that instance…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt it, and I naturally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Someday… would you like to go?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Not really. I’ve been taught a little bit, and… maybe I’d like to see it too… Including the demon world…… various places.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little bit, I felt like I wanted to do what I could, and I put it into words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also rolled his eyes for a moment, but laughed immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahahaha. I am very grateful to have you just to turn the pages of a book I could not read while alive, but is that not a considerable sense of a duty.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Is that what you want to say?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But once you become an Imperial Knight, do you believe you will be afforded that kind of freedom?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar says, if you become an Imperial Knight, you will certainly be given a lot of duties in the capital and as a candidate for executive officers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you consider my father who usually can’t come home, you’ll understand that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, but still, for me to see various places… That’s what it’s all about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I already… It’s okay. For me…… the Imperial Knights. After talking with the princesses, my father, and you, this is how I feel after all.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I feel right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I don’t want to be an imperial knight. Right now I’m… I want to be a man who can go anywhere.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I haven’t decided how to go about it yet, but… about my parents, about the empire, about the warriors… I want the power to go anywhere and not be swayed by such things anymore.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been on a predetermined route, but it’s always been frustrating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, because I said it myself out loud, somehow I felt refreshed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho. The little boy, is in his own way… showing a man’s expression, is he not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Is that right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And, for that I am grateful. For now, it would be my pleasure, to see the world as it stands today.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Do our interests align?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Thus, you must get stronger. I will not have you perish the moment you embark on your journey.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yeah true. I ask that you please take care of me, Master.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, we laughed at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
