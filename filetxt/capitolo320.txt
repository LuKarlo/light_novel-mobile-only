<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something bad is about to happen again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, we went out after we had a delicious breakfast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I was surprised at the sight that spread there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reports of a wounded firedragon rushing in… it was right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is unusual...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we encountered them in the mountains, the dragons stripped out their nails and fangs and attacked them without asking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are five dragons in front of me, but they have painful wounds carved into their bodies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, she seems to be receiving a lot of healing magic and medicine for her elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I didn't know... are dragons and elves close?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wounded dragons are rushing in here and being treated very badly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what? Are they that strong? The other day, I was trampled by humans, and I thought I could lick it like this... hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So you're going to fight back? The rest of you... escape... get hit... seriously ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A chief who seems to be talking to a weakly roaring dragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is the conversation closed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, the Elves who came to call on the Chiefs also asked the Chiefs to talk to them...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, ma'am. What do you mean by that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, I asked my wife not to disturb me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, he can talk to animals and monsters."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know why... so many animals, monsters and dragons live in this forest..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can we talk to animals? Did the chief say something cool?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the trainer beside me.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see... it was Tamer...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tamer? That's a story...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm. Those who can communicate with animals and monsters and make them obey... I suppose it's a constant mozzargouro state...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh Natsu......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's the translation magic of the Ancient Forbidden Curse that Traina told me about a few months ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That? But what do you always say? Isn't that magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm. He doesn't look like that. In other words, it's not magic, it's a state of birth. Originally, the ancient Forbidden Curse was developed with reference to the constitution of such people. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh, was that so? I mean, who's born with that kind of ability?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly unusual, but not all of them. That's why Tamer and his monsters were there a long time ago. Look, the picture book behind the closet in your house... the legendary swordsman who was also the enemy of the augers, the peach boy from the peach... he was also a tamer with his body. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hee......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, you told me the truth about that book before you ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I didn't know the chief had that kind of power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought you didn't eat meat for breakfast....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heeheheheheheheheheheheheheh!? You were attacked by... Demon King Army Augurs!? Hundreds of people!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!?? "" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... searching for elves in a mountain hunt... ah, those guys that are tangled with my mates... my goodness..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the chief's voice of surprise echoed as he heard the story from the wounded dragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King Army? Bokumates?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma, Demon King Army!? The Demon King Army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides... and august!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Holy shit, are those guys hanging around here!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really? Chieftain!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Demon King Army Augurs. The shock shocked the settlement elves all at once, and everyone blushed their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel really cool, too. The other day, they were Amazonians.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, what do we do? If we find this place....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't freak out, idiot. In the meantime, we are the Dark Elves of the Demon King Army....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But Auga... is the most powerful army in the Demon King army, and even more violent and brutal..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Those are... hundreds of them!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, on the contrary, there are only a hundred people... why don't you just take advantage of the local profits and invade us?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But if you lose, you won't just get killed! That's how badly they'll meet..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opinions of the upset elves fly around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Young people say that they should fight with weapons, and women and children and the elderly who cannot fight seem anxious and frightened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh no... the usurpers have certainly vandalized the woods before... but I managed to do something about it. But this time... I can't believe it's an orga..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That tough wife looks the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's all, the Auga race is different from the others... I guess that's what it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Augu... I haven't fought yet"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Espy and Slayer don't seem to have any combat experience against Augusta yet, so I don't think they're coming with Imaichi Pin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile, I....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children. Ask the chief about the characteristics of those who lead the mountain hunters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Ah, oh, okay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's when Traina told me. I asked the chief the question as-is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Can you ask him who's leading the mountain hunting august right now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, yeah. Hey, it's that auger... yeah, the one who was the most... yeah. Yeah.... Blue demon? A horn?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From Traina to me, from me to the chief, from the chief to the dragon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Blue... one horn... 100 people... I see. Independent squad... Aony squad."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like Trainer figured it out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina, do you know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah. In the tens of thousands of large Hakuki armies, one of the hundreds of demons he trusted... the power of one of them, Aony, was so powerful that he could move within ten people from above... so he was also given some discretionary authority to move in the war..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... I didn't know such a title..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... and I see... things are getting better... with the Tsuji..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I don't know if the strong in this era are in the Six Heights and Seven Brave classes, but I know that Traina is pretty strong just because she knows it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, you fought Rokuha. Yamidiré, Palippi, Noja... one or two of the Six Heights will not be your opponents for this period. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not my enemy. I laughed unexpectedly at Traina's appraisal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whew... you'll admit to me a lot too."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't praise anything else. Until the facts are stated. But it's not just about strength... what do we do? Kids. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? What do I do... yes... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like Trainer was spotted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to do this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what to do this time... no, I don't even have to think about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Augur... or..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, when I heard the name of the race, I couldn't help but remember the man who was nicer than anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
