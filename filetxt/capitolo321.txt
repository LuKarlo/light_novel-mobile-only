<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let's get out of here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "What is abandoning our homeland!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While Trayna and I were talking, there was a discussion among the elves about what to do, but only the chief's proposal to "run" was rejected at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's just land. You can move."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What are you talking about? This is where we were born and where we sleep. Don't let the filthy, filthy species get you killed! I'd rather die than abandon this place! That's the pride of the elves!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It seems stupid... hah... to protect the land... territorial strife... after all, humans, demons and elves... humans are the same..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His wife denied it all, and the chief sighed and dropped his shoulders as if he was stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the agitated elves who didn't know what to do also waved their hands as they stretched their faces to see if they were able to unify their intentions with their wives' remarks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, this land must be protected!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Show me the pride of your elves!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "God bless you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, if you want to escape... die!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The voice rises one after the other. I wonder if this is the unique voice of the world of war. I don't understand it and I'm not convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it is also strange for me to deny the idea, so I can't say anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You, help the forest monsters!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even if I say please... I'm the strongest firedragons in the world. Even if I ask other carnivorous people, they think it's Auger....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still! We need a little more power!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like the chief thinks it's weird. I look at my wife and other elves in a very unfortunate way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, the Dark Elf... he's a Demon King Army too, isn't he? Can't you take them hostage and threaten them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, and we may have some information on the augers. All right, bring him in right now and make him throw up everything he knows!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All right, hurry up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, even radical opinions emerge in the fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So stop... hostages, torture... pride? Don't make me laugh... everyone's getting ugly and stupid in progress right now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain! I don't like the usual opposite opinion at times like this! New technologies and ideas devised by chiefs can bring new developments and new awareness to us, but now is the time to be one!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You guys noticed! My head is stiff and my heart is narrow... and I play with words like life and pride..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, only the chief really seemed to think differently from the other elves and was not convinced to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even though he is a chief, he is unable to convince other elves of his opinion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now... what about you? Kids."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, what do I do there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since we came to this era, I've been trying not to interfere in the battles of this era, nor in the battles of the Demon King army... but I'm sure I haven't been able to... but what do we do now anyway?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, I don't feel comfortable fighting Augu myself... that's not what I'm supposed to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's none of your business, it's none of your business, so leave the elves alone and we can't escape..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to go any further, and I don't want to fight the Demon King Army as much as I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, there is no need to think about this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, let's see what happens to the Elves here... with the Chiefs. More than a decade later, when some great demon king became a ghost... he was sad that one culture had disappeared. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... fu... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That novel has inspired me to realize that the Great Demon King has many aspects to its existence... and in a way, it's something that I have in mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, I got along with my chief and wife, and I was fed, and my sister and disciples were taken care of....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oniichan... even the Demon King army... is annoying. But... it's dangerous for you guys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll follow oniisan either way..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like there's nothing wrong with both of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't help it if this happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shhhhh. Will we join them?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If oniisan says so...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well then, I guess this won't be a good match for the augers...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I can only imagine what the Elves think, what the Chiefs think, and what the coming Augers will do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain! I've brought the Dark Elf woman!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Young elves came with weapons and surrounded themselves, bringing their captive dark elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... hey, oniichan"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, that guy...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya also noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Definitely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... I wonder what's going on in the morning... even if I execute a junior student... something funny is happening."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dark elf with an unbelievable smile, tied by a rope and shackled in both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sure... Ralviv... was it? The one Noja used to call me a black one or something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up, you lousy dark elf, and answer our questions quietly!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tell me about the augers who came to this mountain! What are their weaknesses?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tell me everything you know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the chief said, the beautiful looks of the elves turn ugly and smash rough words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Ralwife is still not moving in this situation. On the contrary, the elves laughed with their noses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, I don't know which unit. The elementary school students didn't even know that Augusta's troops had come to this mountain in the first place. Though the same Demon King army, I don't really understand the movements of another army....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you mean? I thought you were here to help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu... that kind of thing to do. Even elementary school students don't understand. I'll just tell you this. Auga means the opponent is a fierce and brutal force, the strongest and most feared of the Demon King Army's troops, General Hakuki! You guys can beat me! Minagorosida... women and children are relentlessly humiliated and suffered more than death. That's right... there are no shards of tenderness or mercy, you bastards!... yes... not like that guy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not a threat, it's actually a ralweigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... looks like a blue demon with a horn..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Blue...? Fuhahaha, ahoney... I see... I know him well... and he won't be your opponent."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those words also blushed the faces of the elves who had stood up earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, I was a little worried about the expression that Ralviv showed me for just a moment, something cute and sad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that expression quickly changed, and Ralviv spoke again with a strong tone.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You worthless elves! If you want to survive, pull your heads down on the humans and pull out the Seven Braves! Well, I don't think you can do that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time as that word.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ehhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My sister stepped forward and laid her hands on her hips, stretching out her chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hehe?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that Ralwyev also floated and stiffened his ass.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hah...?... the Espi of the Seven Heroes!? Come, why are you here!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "..." Huh? Seven braves!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there were a lot of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come, you too!? Genius Hunter... Slaya!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Ralph didn't even know we were here. Totally unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The elves also seemed to know only the title of the Seven Braves, and their mouths were opened and hardened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? Espi and Slaya... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah... what a title..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My wife and chief are surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you think? If we were here, wouldn't we be able to handle the world's ignorant elves?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come, you...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, I got out in front of Ralvie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, looking at me, Ralviv....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "C 'mon, you are... the man who punched that big, fat, insidious thing into Noja's asshole!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's a fact, but it's a fact!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What an irrational thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralvie's remarks made me look like the other elves were pulling away from me at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Maybe... Noja is the sixth hegemon of the Demon King Army... I'm not really familiar with it, but was she called a little girl warrior? What? Little girl... that asshole? Big and fat... eh? Oniisan?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't pull me to the chief! No, don't let your title fool you! He's an incredibly big monster... and he's got a helix in him! Spiral! Drill! And in a way... don't look at me like that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone's eyes looked like ugly beasts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
