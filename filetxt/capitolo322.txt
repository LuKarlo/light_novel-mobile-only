<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh my God... I don't know much about the underworld, but I know the names of the Six Heights and the Seven Braves... Espi... were you the Seven Braves?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! That's why I'm going to take down a little bit of orgasms!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Espi declares so confidently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, that's what I'm talking about. And now there's not just Espi, there's me and Slaya. I'll help you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Augustus... it's going to be a good experience."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And don't worry about us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the smiles of the elves who were surprised by the title of the Seven Heroes of Espi burst out for a moment, but immediately everyone had a confused face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait, humans... what do you want?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, one of the elves asked us to look at our faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you want?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think a greedy man moves in return for nothing. What do you want? Is it a treasure or... a woman?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, what..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Speaking of which, you did a dirty thing with a toddler fighter earlier... and now you're still bringing a child like this... you... I don't think that kind of hobby... is looking for an elf girl...! Stupid thing!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait, wait, wait, wait, what happened!? That's it. I've been taking care of you all night, so don't think so hard. Come on, I don't have any dangerous hobbies! I normally like decent women! I'm sure you're the ones who are barbaric!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, what, you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like we suspected doing something for free, and that's why we got some weird suspicions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, I guess so... keep the truth about oniisan's hobbies... this oniisan... really doesn't want anything in return."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There are a lot of people... who only know boxers... but I don't think there are a few of them like oniisan."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the chief wasn't the only one who suspected it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, the Elves are puzzled by the words of the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... that's it... don't get distracted ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Maybe oniichan's power... might really help us defeat the augurs... but... then, nothing will change..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An unexpected word from the chief. I didn't know what that meant either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The enemies are quite famous... Whether they chase them back or even kill them, they will be sent even stronger... strong enemies of the Demon King army. It may be the Rokkai himself, or maybe the Great Demon King will come directly... just like when Sisonotami was destroyed... the more we fight, the less it will end... so, humans, demons, the earth, and the magic world will always be at war... and if we join in it, we will end up in the same pitfalls..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A chief who talks cold, stunned, and uncomfortable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the battle for the survival of humans and demons that is currently happening in the world is stupid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... well, what do you want me to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So let's run away. Is this our land? So why don't you give it to me? Nothing. Our ancestors just happened to live here, and our territory is not universally recognized... but when we start talking about it, it's Mendoz again... so don't fight, let's run."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't like it. Because the life of an elf is a long one... I don't want to be swayed by that kind of thing for a long time. Once we get involved, we'll never get out of this mud."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's up to you... really, you're fundamentally different from us..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not really an elf. Or maybe the last life was a peaceful world."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, yes, not at all... but yet... you won't run away by yourself..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... because it's been a long life... I just don't want to die abandoning people who got married unintentionally or admired a little bit, and live with that guilt for decades... it's just one of the mudslides I can't get out of once I get involved with. So marriage is the cemetery of life."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu. Tell me you honestly don't want to lose me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief's idea was, in a sense, his own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I refuse to give up things like ancestry, pride, history, war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps they would be angry if they heard about the troops who are at war with their lives, but I don't know how they feel about not wandering around like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I'd stop being an Imperial Knight and live free.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's the same as running away. Do you think there's a convenient place to stay before you run away? Not to mention, if we live alone in hiding, we're all alone."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, even Slaya challenged the chief's thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oh... the core of my child... oh... it's tough... but... yeah... that's when there's no Demon King army or humans... I have to go to a world where no one lives or to a star..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's true to say stupid things. Don't even fight, just run around... and find their place in it... sweet, you're..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that there is something that I think will become a slayer, as if it is a real feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, like Espi, he lives at his age, turning the world by himself, earning money as a hunter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What about his home, his parents? I haven't heard anything like that either, but I understand that you've been having a tough time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess that's why he said it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi may be the same in that sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I ran away too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the chief also seems to know that with that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, that's also true... that's why I can't push hard either... but I can't win a fight... even in the six-way eye... Kaguya-sama was no match for the Great Demon King Traina... because the Demon King Army is occupying the land of Sisonotami, which is the only possibility... I don't know... I don't have a key in the first place..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?... hmm?... this one..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief, who was told by the child Slaya to look down with a bitter smile, murmured something, but couldn't hear it well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Trainer reacted somehow.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, you guys... don't ignore the junior!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, at that time, the captive woman who had been stunned until now finally made a loud noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why are you here?! You're telling me the Allies are working with the Elves!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralph, who was surprised that we were here, screamed as he stared at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's a coincidence. Besides, we have nothing to do with the Allies."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu, stop it! There's an espionage and it doesn't matter!? And yet you intercept the Aonys? It doesn't make any sense! Either way, it does not change that you are the enemy of the Demon King army!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not an enemy, be careful. I'm not an enemy, but there are times when I fight. That's pretty bad, isn't it? The chiefs seem to be in danger, and I'm getting along, so I'm just trying to help."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, that nasty reasoning is a filthy person! Because of people like you... that person... who was more kind to me than anyone..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? They're staring at me with their murderous eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not my fault he's being caught like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh! You want to have white and black elves, don't say dirty things about people! I'm not even saying that I'm pretty, but if I don't have to fight, then so be it! You may not believe me... but I have a best friend in Augu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I don't know...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I accidentally said it was cute. Well, it's not like I'm keeping it a secret.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Friends with Augus? Huh?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, are you serious!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, I'm not a liar... Augu and his friends?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in this world of our time, "august and friend" seems incredible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espires are also surprised by their "incredible" expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What...? It's possible! If you live in the same demonic realm as the juniors, people like you are Augu and friends?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is an indisputable fact.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When was it a fact? That guy... ran away and ran into me by chance... and he was a mess... sweeter than anyone else."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka-san... you must be somewhere in this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you still in the Demon King Army? Or have you already escaped the Demon King army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't meet you in this era, and I can't give you a name on a boulder... Aka-san... see you...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
