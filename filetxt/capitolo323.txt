<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't bullshit me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can't believe what I'm saying, Ralph.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if that's the case...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not bullshit! Take a look at this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's how I took out the thing hanging inside my clothes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was "that day", the night I first met Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Handmade accessories and sculptures decorated in the house. It was all handmade by Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Say whatever you like to me, and then I'll have the stone necklace you gave me that day. Even though I gave it to Aka, Aka was very pleased with what she gave me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This stone necklace! I got this from my best friend!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I showed the proof to Ralph and everybody... I can't believe Auga made such a small necklace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniichan, is that so ~?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Augu... did that? No, I don't think oniisan would lie."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised at first, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka-san is clever enough to make such a slender statue of a goddess....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is that!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, that? Does Ralwife tremble and open his eyes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would you do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's... passed down to the dark elves... like an amulet... and it's shaped like... my home... with its own emblem..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Dark Elves? Ah, that's right...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It must have been written in Aka's letter at the end of the day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He lived in the Dark Elves with his parents and did things like a vigilante.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, no... you said you lived in the Dark Elves with your parents when you were young..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then. Ralviv, who had been staring at me for so long, suddenly showed a weak expression like a lost child crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No way... no way..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was happy at the same time. It was the same with Trainer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... child. No way, this guy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh... no way... no way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can see the look on your face. This guy....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you... what's the name of that auger...? No, when did you meet that auger...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked with my eyes as if they were scratching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was unexpectedly confused and stuck in words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… They're coming!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly the chief raised his voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, something like glass broke into pieces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the magical boundary that covered this settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it was destroyed....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, but did they find out about this place?! Fast....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, women and children and the elderly who can't fight are in the house!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shit, shit! Hurry up and get your weapons!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You'll have to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, I see... as usual, I have to protect everything..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not like you're already talking about attacking us or running away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We have to fight more than we've ever seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll talk to you later. Espi, Slaya, it's coming... don't be alarmed."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just me and oniichan. Slaya, you can stay behind."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't be alarmed, but let's do it between me and oniisan. Why don't you just stand back, because the Espi is so tight?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We stood up with the two little boys who were motivated and snorty. And simultaneously activate the radar....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There you are! Hundreds... perfect!... up there!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My radar picked it up. Beyond the woods surrounding the settlement, there are demons sneaking up in a chunk... one of whom threw a big weapon at us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, something's coming down!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hyi, yo, dodge..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant iron rod with pungent projections.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the picturebook peachboys had those weapons... gold sticks!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fluffy catch!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the weapon was captured by the Espi without touching his hand in the air by his ability.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Iron Magic Shining Darkness Augur Buster Blade!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slayer knocked down a gold stick floating in the air with a giant sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "Oh, oh, oh, oh!" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elves exclaim at the series of moves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is it, Beta? My gold stick is stubborn? What are you talking about?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huge bodies step into the entrance to the settlement with Zushin and loud footsteps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, I don't know, Captain. Wow, let's just fuck this up."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, don't touch the elf virgin. Because it sells at a high price."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow. And I don't mind killing a man and Zijibaba. However, men who look good should be careful because it sells at a high price."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Dammit, the humans have a fine order... why do we have to take orders from those hadakazal monkeys?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Blurred. General's orders. Besides, they say you can do whatever you want with non-virgins, so let's have some fun with the leftovers."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ugh... big... muscle particles... but... not at all...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ki, you... demons..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, it looks strong...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "More powerful than the firedragons... * giggle *..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're here..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is true that the figure is an auger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, maybe that's the auger that everyone's afraid of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My eyes... my expression... are completely different"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike my best friend I know... it's completely different from Aka-san.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike that expression that was nicer than anyone else... what a distorted eye... it makes me throw up just by watching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, the Demon King Army. I don't want to get involved as much as I can, say anything, or put out my hands...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Leave it to me. Do what you want."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We have to fight here.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... ahhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh?.... nh? That's... that's my daughter! What are you doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kh... I don't look good..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was caught!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... more than that, Aony! I need to talk to you! Your childhood friend..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Ralvif cried unto the blue demon in the middle of them, and saw it, and he round his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, Dark Elves! Captain, that pornographic costume... is that the demon king's army? Something's caught....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah, ahh... that's... that's Ralwyeife from the Amazonas unit, Beta."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ralviv?... oh, that black one! Yes, he... is the daughter of the chief of the settlement where that fucking idiot lived!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Other augers noticed the presence of Ralph, but they also noticed something else, and laughed with an ugly smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I know that too! That's right, that stupid... useless Aka is from the settlement, isn't it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... eh? Now... what...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aka? Ah, that disqualified, nasty idiot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, the lowest coward in Auga's history, the one who can't read the air and cools!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no. Did he help? Anyway, he surrendered because the humans were always alive, so it was a good time to rape and hang out with the captive women he captured. Wait, why isn't he crying after that? Hahahahaha!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, is he missing? Well, I wouldn't be in any trouble without such an idiot. You're a zero-handed idiot."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And... what are these guys... saying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is Ralph angry? No, he's from Aka... I mean, do you know Aka? Did they know about Aka?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yaaaaaa! He's dead, Beth! I'll never talk about a dead guy again! Yes, he's dead!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Well, it doesn't matter, but I don't think it's going to come up with that stupid topic."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Aka is supposed to be dead...? In other words, Aka is no longer from the Demon King Army... no, not anymore... not anymore!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Actually, that scum made me so frustrated that I could have killed him with my own hands anyway... well, sure enough, leave the dead idiots alone, and now the elves..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, in the meantime, if we sort things out... no, you don't have to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They're the ones I know....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, here we go, woodbugs! We 're--"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Koraaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ha...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Smash!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gus tried to scream something by himself, but before I heard it all, I ran out and smashed his jaw and smashed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, ah, that guy...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know, to you? Humans?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crushed bones on your left hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as I can tell, I haven't punched as much as I could since this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how hard I punched that huge graphic opponent when I was in Noja, I couldn't help it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But not now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Demon King Army... is not evil if it's not an enemy... so I didn't intend to fight aggressively, even if I were a human... but Wally was different this time on his own."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My best friends... they're talking with such rotten eyes, with their mouths shut...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Temee, come on! I'll take care of all the hundreds!
