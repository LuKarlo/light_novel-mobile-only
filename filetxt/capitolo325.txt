<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coming? I don't know what happened to it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hnhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just that your arms aren't big enough. Its muscles certainly contain a densely loaded "force".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's definitely different from the augers I hit in a flash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll step behind Aony.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chiefs, you'd better stay away a bit....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh... awesome..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, the earth broke!? What a destructive force!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the center of the settlement exploded, a roar sounded and a huge hole was formed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's a lot of power... but... there's plenty of space, it's too shaky, and there's no way to avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suba-shikikikibesa
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Temee is dull."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately, Aony backfired against me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I already know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A radar that has been heavily trained since this era began. Prefetch improved by mastery.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I know how Aony works.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I know.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kukuba-!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony edged the counter fist right in front of her as she tried to force her muscles to "attack like this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what's wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh... oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is neither carelessness nor overconfidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't lick me! Ghostbusters!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Continuous punch with both arms. It approached like a wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no matter how much you look, it only looks like you're hitting me alternately on each arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you come straight to the right, just squeeze your fist from the top with your left hand and parse, and if you come straight to the left, just parse with your right hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, nh, nh... what?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While stopping your feet, your upper body and hands alone are passing through Aony's continuous punches.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Paris!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does it hit?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything that happens with apnea. Parry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, no, Captain! That's not true!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid, ho, seriously, Captain Aony!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now show me the power of the Oni Tenryu Daiichi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it hits, ordinary people won't get a single attack in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other augers, who are not fainted, shook up their voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Su, Slaya-kun... can you... do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "M... I can't... even when I was fighting Noja in the first place. Oniisan's big moves, punches and foot judging tend to take my eyes off me... but... it's like I'm in control of everything in battle... my eyesight is like reading everything..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought it was strong... but I didn't think it was that strong. Now... what happens to this...? Oniisan"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, he wasn't just a pervert... was he so strong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if this is all you can identify, it matches the punch the other person put on the most weight.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gu, damn it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here it is! The Great Demon Cross Counter!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The crossed fist returned the counter with Aony's Attack Up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I crushed the flesh, my face fell with my fist, my nose, my teeth, my bones, and I beat him up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ah... shit..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At last, he lay on his back and moaning without being able to get up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, it can be said that everything is settled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "S, wow... oniichan, you're strong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's my big brother, Stream Stone... imagining being beaten with a punch like that would make me feel terrible..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Tsuyoshi...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't believe it...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Su, wow! Those people... in an instant... ""
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rising cheers. The elves who were treating me like perverts are laughing back at me and shouting their fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cash guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But a few months ago, I was still there, but after that, Aka was much stronger than all the hundreds here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, to this extent...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I felt something piercing in the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chilly...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I can't do this anymore."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you still conscious? But what are you talking about while he's lying on his back?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you feel any pain after hitting me like that? Quiet and expressionless.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sure, the omen is Zuye. But it's not enough to change or protect the world. It's halfway there."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah? Temee, what are you doing...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, here's the thing... protect me... even the Seven Brave Hieros couldn't win... and I don't know that either, so I can say half things like august and friend..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? This silence... is like before the storm...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still from here... child
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You've grown stronger... so you can confront that Roku-hachi... but the name of Oni Tenryu Dainishita... is not that cheap."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Traina whispered in my ear that you knew everything from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know! But they're coming!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shit! What the hell...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something... explodes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's wrong, oniisan?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sweated cold on my spine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was unexpectedly jumping off the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Cool and smart... hopefully hazleha crushing sebastia"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A very gentle tone. Yet the mountains, the forests, and the whole area freeze in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The corners of his head grew even sharper and larger, his whole body turned blue and black, and his eyes turned cold and sharp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This power... is similar to that of Aka-san, who was attacked by Sinov's brothers and burned down his fields and house, but slightly different...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Unlike Aka-san... who exposed everything and rolled it, this one... is quietly burning inside... it's a clean and cool type..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Traina is right, the title is cheap and not Date.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, we too...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, you don't have to. Both of you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feeling the changed air, Espi and Slayer tried to join us, but they didn't need it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Did I miss my expectations? Then I'll tell you about me, and I'll fully meet your expectations."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A single hit made the opponent stronger, and they just had to hit harder to defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I'll smash it in and carve it in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever you need.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
