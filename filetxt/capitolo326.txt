<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's so quiet that I don't think I'm confronting Augustus.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think about stripping your teeth out and brawling like a storm, you're quietly packing up like a first-class swordsman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would be quite troublesome to calm down and increase your strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Jabb!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power and speed of battle have increased, but I don't think you can scratch my left with such a figure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then shake your jaw.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ghost Elbow"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony also reacted. But it can't be avoided... can it? Elbow Block? The hardness of the body... can't be stopped, no, I'll beat you like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, nnh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, my left fist ran into pain. Pain as if something sharp and hard had pierced it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're playing my jab with your elbows... that's not the end of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ghost Elbow Cut!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the spot, he shakes his elbows down diagonally and tries to rip me apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast and powerful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A vacuum wave is coming out and trying to rip me apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I was aware of that beforehand, so I crouched down and avoided it at the same time as the backstep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from there.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's a big reaction... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oops...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony filled me up with a big crotch step, and with a crouched eye on me, he wiped his right knee as hard as he could... ah... this is a terrible one...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It'll shatter!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Augusta's giant body and stiff arms tend to catch my eye, but the worst part is his feet that support it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, kicks are four times as powerful as punches, and legs are stronger than arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, feet that are many times more powerful than those stiff arms... and as sharp and hard as elbows... knees!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Blue knee!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Breakthrough!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I hit it, I tried to hit the boulder, and I immediately activated Breakthrough, leaving the scene even faster than Aony's speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, what a pity... no, more than that, what did that man do?! What about the light that covers that body?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And now... it's too fast to move!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still having such a deep hand... uhh, that's not true... what's wrong with that man!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You avoided Captain Aony's knee kick!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You used a reflective breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not a good move to use against Demon Kings in these times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what? Is that it? Do you understand?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, if you think it's a rough personality, oniisan uses dexterity magic..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... by the way, Espi? Do you know what oniisan's technique... is?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu ~ n, don't you know Slaya? That's a super oniichan that oniichan uses when he's serious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Espi. That's not it either!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, when I used it until breakthrough, I could feel what would happen if I compared my strength with that of Aony.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That knee kick is a threat, but with speed and a blow to the right, there's no way to defeat it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... ah... hey... when people get a little dangerous... they run away right away"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was calmly analyzing the difference between the opponent and myself, Aony exhaled and laughed at me as if I was disappointed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Omei too. While you're in a safe place, arrange everything as clean as you can, but when it gets dangerous, you can quickly escape to your own cuteness. After all, I'm such a man... nnh... such a man... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This... is too easy to understand provocation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew it at the moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even a regular beating is bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're trying to drag me into your realm by provoking me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a provocation.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, if you're a smart auger, you'll be able to spot that right away. Just like Aka, eh... Usnoro's cowardly idiot could be fooled by Colo right away... really, he's a good place to look at Augu's dirty... Beta"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahn?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, if you think so, it certainly suits you. A coward auger and a coward, a coward friend of yours? Well, it's such a half-bad."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. You're here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think I'm gonna get mad at you like this....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not saying cheap provocation... I'll tell you what, it'll be expensive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, what are you saying...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I won't let you say that again, even if it's provocation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't doubt it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll prove it to him... so I'll buy it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I dropped my hips on the spot and pretended to be a headband once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, I think I'm stupid about the boulder myself, and honestly, it's gonna hurt, and I think it's bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya might be a little noisy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wish it was easier if we did it properly... but I don't know what to do...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not a victory... but a battle to prove it... wow. Don't run, I'll prove it! Don't run away from Temee's knee, hit me in the head and crush me on the contrary!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... fu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fufufu......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "Eh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone's surprised. The augurs, Espi, Slaya, the chiefs, the wives, the other elves, Ralvives.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No... not everyone... Traina smiles and says "Go" to me silently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, that's impossible. Anyway, let's get out of here right away, and I'll withdraw my foreword and cry and run away. Like Aka."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uuuuuuuu. I'll make your blue-black face even more pale than it used to be."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder. Rather than laughing at me for a moment... and laughing at me like I was on a provocation... like I said, "Try it"...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, don't worry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not talking about thinking about anything with my head right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't think about it, just stick it in your instincts!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
