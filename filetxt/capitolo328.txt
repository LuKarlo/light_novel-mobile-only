 "Why, why... why, why, why, why... what the hell is going on with Aka..."

 Ralph the Dark Elf seems pretty confused, but I can't care less.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many times has this happened? Is this about two or three times?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... check it out, ethee... here. As everyone told me in preparation for the battle, the beasts in the woods that I secretly called for... I've kept them waiting around the settlement..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Oh, really... when..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, but regardless of my instructions, the animals and the dragons are stunned by this encounter... I know... even the animals. Instead of letting go, you can't let go anymore... instinctively."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ahh... I don't even know if it hurts anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, are you stupid?! Are you stupid!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, are you stupid!? Are you stupid!?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two younger sisters and younger brothers started calling each other "idiots."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I'm an idiot....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, but ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your neck is lifted, your forehead is broken, blood is spraying out, and your consciousness is flying a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't stand it anymore!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll give you my hand, oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't pull it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I accept the word idiot, I don't accept it either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hands... dahhhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fortunately, I can still speak... my mouth is shaggy, and even if I don't do anything, I can't speak very well because of the bleeding...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, why, oniisan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is my idea.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh, heh... it's okay... Espi... Slaya... even stupid. You can't move with reason just for now... there are times like this... This is my moment."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why even my younger brother won't let me do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's bad for the two of you who are worried and crying, but if they don't get in the way, I managed to smile at the mouth with only the taste of blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know if you're laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ome... ugh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony has a painful face on her knees against me like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, hee... what's wrong? Aoney... not yet... just a little bump..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I heard the kick is stronger than the punch... but I'm not going to beat Aka when she really cuts off."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If it's as good as this, you're still cumming!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, when I get here, I'm used to it... if I don't feel my face and my consciousness doesn't fly...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ome... what makes me do that... idiot... babe?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gudaguda, don't talk to me! The Great Devil..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gu, cum... blue knees aaaa, ahhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Headbugging... giggle!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, nasty... I'm in a lot of nasty territory. I don't know if it hurts or if it's hot or painful anymore... can't you feel it? Did they ask you something now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why am I doing this? Didn't I tell you not to run?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I didn't want to be bothered... but I wasn't strong enough to tell you to bother me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, I'm supposed to be confused, but I kind of speak naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know about the world... about the war... about the species... I didn't know much about it... so... after I know everything... I'll tell you the same thing again... it's not a nuisance..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ome..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Never bend this! After all, Aka... this is the first time you've seen me as me... because I'm a cop!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I don't know... but... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ruaaaaahhhh, Big Devil Headbud!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just in case... it doesn't seem like a lie... blue-kneed!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka-san... I'm not who I was. Not even me now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe not yet. But I'm stronger. I've seen a lot of things. I've been through it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It will be stronger from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ba, it's a kick... ah, that's how Captain Aony kicks his knees... no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... the worst thing about it is that you're such an idiot... and then the rest..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... Captain Aony! We can beat him up and kill him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ok, now... pupupu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... Captain Aony!? Well, why us... we're just Captain Aony's..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he complains... he's the enemy of the whole world...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Get in the way! I don't think I can kill that motherfucker by myself! Hah, hah, hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, what are you doing!? Besides, we don't make public anything to be ashamed of!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah? Ah? Are you sure...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you notice anything, are they rubbing each other's orgasms?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I tried to head over again, there was no sign of coming from the other side, and I felt the difference and stopped unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't understand the meaning of such a crazy person. I don't even know what to do with the captain!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah... the other augers tried to get into Aony's auxiliary blade. Well, my sister and brother wouldn't shut up at that moment, but Aoni refused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Aony is also mean... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what's wrong with Temee?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Like a human kid, or something like that, pride? Or how proud are you to be an auger, even if Aka insults you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a simple question. Even if you do it properly, you can't beat me, so I thought you were going to provoke me and lure me to defeat me, but if you do, you should surely surround me and defeat me with your men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Aony refused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, Aony had a collision with me and only used her right knee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is discolored and swollen to the extent that it is already broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You could have used as many cowardly hands as you wanted, whether you were using your other leg or cheating and using both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "To prove that my thoughts for Aka are not just words. But what is Temee? Is there any reason why you should break your knees and be attracted to people you don't like?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony ignores the words of his men. Why are you foolishly and honestly dealing with this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suddenly wondered about that....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's up, Beth? Suddenly it got hard... and I finally figured out what to do with words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aony didn't answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah... I just hate it and it's annoying... humans... and that... idiot..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I see. I mean, if we don't settle this, we won't say anything."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu... I'm sure of it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Excellent. It certainly doesn't have to end incompletely like this, because...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now, break it and fall down! Great Devil Headbud!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're the one who's going to crush me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll settle this completely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, either way, maybe I can't help it until the other augers are still here... Espi... Slaya... with the chiefs...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, what do you think the captain thinks... no... in case the captain falls... gu... I can't help it... nobody's watching now... okay, let's use the magic crystal to join the army!... the army, the Aony Squad. As soon as possible..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Aony team, that was just fine. I was just about to contact you. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'll talk to you later. I'm in a bad mood right now... and the most powerful one... the squad is almost destroyed... and Captain Aony is currently at war... but as it is..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What, Captain Aony? I see... so powerful an enemy... actually, when you merge stories from bokmates, it turns out that there may be a fairly powerful elf in the elf colony you went looking for... was it true?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? No... that's... besides, it's not about elves right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But don't worry. As a matter of fact, just now, to check it out... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, why don't you knock this guy down, have the other spies knock him out, and listen to Aony slowly when he wakes up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General Hakuki is on his way."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
