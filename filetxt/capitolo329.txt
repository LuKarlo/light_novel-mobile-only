<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, if I remember correctly, it was around this time of the year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Hakki's army's Oddball Great Hundred has been reported dead ...... Hmmm ......, not killed in battle... ...executed for failing a mission and being responsible for destroying a squad ...... Aonie ...... I've heard the name before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In those days, reports of battle deaths were commonplace and not uncommon, even if they were troop leader level deaths.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, if there is a reasonably famous name among the hundreds of war dead that are reported every day, it would certainly catch the eye of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the same that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the pile of letters carried in the Demon King's Castle's office, he was having a meeting with three of the Six High Priests who were in the castle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Hihahahahaha, they're the ones carrying out the request from the Bokumates as an example, Great Demon Lord. It's a good thing that they can't even use a human messenger ...... that they are the commander of one of the best and fiercest 100 men and women in the world, because it's a shameful ...... that they're so funny!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Paripi, what a disrespectful attitude to the great great demon king. Shall I cut off his head and feed it to the demon fish?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I'm still hard as ever, Miss Yamidire. Don't you think so?　The old man from The Lyphant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, Yamidire is right. You are more aware of yourself as a six-people, Zoë. It's a good thing that you're on a expedition, Hakuki and Gouda ...... that took a leave of absence suddenly under these circumstances, Noja ...... now, our three remaining in the home country must support the Great Demon Lord and lead the Demon Lord's army!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ahhhh, the old man over here was also a stiff. The only thing I can think of is that I'm not going to be able to talk about it if Noja is around. ...... No, I don't think the story is right. It's just interesting. Heehahahahaha!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's about all we talked about at the time, and I quickly rolled up to the next page of the list of war death reports.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the remainder of the day was certainly seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aonie's name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mission failure. The destruction of the unit. So I guess that's what happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Shut up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ggaaaaaaahhhhhh!'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were too many dead people in this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am unable to grasp all of the people who risked their lives for the demon world and the demon king's army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I did was at least read the names of the dead and then engrave only the names in my memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know how each and every one of them lived, how they joined the Demon King's Army, and what kind of battle they ended up in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This Aonie is one of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A warrior who clashes openly with his apprentice, whom I am now training with great care, with his body, life and soul at stake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But we know how it ends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He takes responsibility for failing the mission and destroying the unit and is executed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't even check the mission description.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had left the matter with Bokumates in Hakki's hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I didn't expect to know what it was all about now, and figure out the history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aonie ...... you were defeated here ...... and failed in your mission to capture the elves, and Hakki will be held responsible for that ...... demon king's army. You who fought for and served the Demon King's Army until you earned the title of Great Spiritual Hundred, were defeated by the disciples of ...... that I trained... ...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cannot tell that to the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you tell the child, whose heart and spirit are still sweet, about it, he will feel responsible for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is ...... and ...... for his own sake that he should not be in this age.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that is a responsibility that is not necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, the child can fight as he or she sees fit. There is a reason why it is non-negotiable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ''Aonie,'' he said. It's a good thing that you're able to get the best out of it. So fight to your heart's content so that you don't have any regrets. That's no longer the only thing I can do: ...... Sorry ......'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's because I can take responsibility and feel sorry for you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a good thing that you're not going to have to worry about the fact that you're not going to be able to get your hands on any of these things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you mean by ......?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's just the way it is. ...... This Aonie person ...... child seems to be aware of it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the execution squad that does the Bokumates' requests. That includes inhumane content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when it comes to those who do it, it is limited to those who have killed minds and those who are not afraid to do so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And those who slandered and mocked Aka were the ones who could do so. That's the kind of eyes they had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this Aonie did not have rotten eyes. Perhaps she was killing her mind to carry out the task she was given.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The true nature of this guy's true nature was revealed as he had become selfless by clashing with the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He's a proud warrior with a passionate and straightforward heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why the child can go in as a fight with nothing more than a head butt and a knee kick, without any doubt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even if Aonie's subordinate ogres tried to side-step him, he was able to leap off of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then, if that happens, it's ...... against Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'I told you!　I still have to admit I'm not ready for this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No longer does this Aonie think about defeating the child or winning. That is not the purpose of Aonie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She appears to be testing the child. She is trying to price the child and expect something from him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ha, ha, ha ...... discipline ...... then I'm going to end this already!　...... Mr. Macho, ...... I'll borrow your skills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nuh-uh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?　The child has only ever lowered his stance and run straight, but this is the first time he's shown his stance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Down on one knee, hands on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see, the start that Macho did in the Cacletale competition, where he exploded the power he had accumulated over a short distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical crouching start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a good thing that you're a disciplinarian ...... and so is O'Meara. ...... Do you want to come crash your head into it more than ever before?　My knees are around my knees, and I'm in such a mess that I can't even recognize my face. And it's insane. How can ...... be friends with you, you redneck!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sana ...... the other way around, ...... I'm wondering too. How can you be so gutsy and tweaked ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nuh-uh. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do you think you should go to ...... and call Mr. Aka ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care!　I don't care about that scum anymore!　He's dead ...... and that's fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, the words you are putting in your mouth are not true. The child seems to have noticed the quicksilver too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This Aonie has some sort of reason for this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that is something that must be settled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Then I'll destroy ...... and then I'll let you talk!　Let's go!　Great Demon Dash Diving Headbutt!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, ......, if you don't have a mouth to feed, I'm going to give it a try!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, the last ......!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nuh-uh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it?　Suddenly, an overwhelming sense of oppression is felt even in this spirit body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, what is ...... not ...... now, I sensed the presence of some one ...... approaching here from a little further away than here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it's not ...... someone-not ...... this much ...... only one person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Well, no way .......'
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that Aonie and her friends were defeated and defeated on this occasion, and then returned to the main camp and ...... differently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ayatsu is said to be still alive after the war. But Ayatsu would only know the child as Hiro's son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I never met ...... I assumed that ...... but now that I think about it, neither Kojiro nor Noja ...... could possibly be with that guy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think we're going to meet here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but but Yamidire was more or less connected to Ataturk at ...... Kakreterre, and at that time, the Doji was ...... no, I don't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you didn't know Doe as Earth Lagan, did that guy and Doe meet here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that happens, you can see what this place will look like, even if it's not: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my words cannot reach the child now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With all her strength, she slammed into Aonie's knee and Aonie's right knee was completely destroyed and Aonie slumped to the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not a matter of how much you feel ...... anymore, your knee is ...... shattered ...... regardless of how you feel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey ...... did you see ......? I'm ...... aka you and ------
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watching him, the child collapsed with a bloody smile on his face and fell to the ground with a pat on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was unaware of the looming aunt's presence: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
