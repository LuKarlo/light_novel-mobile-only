 Phianse Depaltia, the Imperial Princess and a child of a hero, was dreaming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a child who was yet to enter the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was studying with a tutor in the royal palace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Phianse at that time could not concentrate on her studies much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess… It’s time to study. I don’t want you staring out the window too much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U-uh… it’s because…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tutor reprimands Phianse for trying to peek outside from the desk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Phianse pouts like a hag and shows no sign of remorse for her circumstance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, she is clearly distracted and only cared about the window.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heey, Phianse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh! They came!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment she heard the voice, Phianse reacted immediately and stood up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey! Phianse! We’re going to play hero, you come too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “OK! Comiiiing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse opens the window with a smile like a blooming flower at the young voice heard from outside the window.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, there were three childhood friends on the lawn in the garden of the royal palace which spread out outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo! How long have you been cramming for, come on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… I’m not a child, I’m a make-believe hero…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal~, we’re still children, right~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A boy with an unyielding fiendish smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little cool boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The smallest boy of the three, with a girl-like face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the trio that Phianse always played with and a source of trouble for the tutor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ha~a…… Again, Mr. Earth. The princess is studying at the moment, isn’t she? Aren’t you going to make your father mad as well?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tutor tried to give the boy at the lead a stern warning, but he had no fear, and young Earth replied to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is also a great study! Phianse is a member of our neo-heroes! This is a study to become a hero! Isn’t that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Arms folded, the tutor went ‘ahem’ with his head held up and chest out towards Earth, but Phianse using that chance, put her feet outside and jumped out the window even though she had a dress on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! The Study of the hero is important, so I’ll do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, tch, princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Phianse jumped to the outside and reached out, Earth took her hand with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The children held hands tightly. Phianse smiled happily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, princess! Mr. Earth! You can play, after your studies are over! Today, I have to ask the princess to do the work properly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the tutor does not easily let go either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He puts his foot on the window as if to follow Phianse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It came, the Great Demon King Katekyoshi! Neo Heroes, at ready! Protect our friends!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Oh!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Boys and girls holding toy swords, long sticks and canes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They don’t take a step back from the tutor, who started to get a little serious, to protect Phianse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heroes protect their friends no matter what! So, don’t worry, Phianse. Whatever we do, we’ll protect you from the Demon King!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Afu~u… un…… Protect meee…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth puts Phianse on his back, leans over as if he was a shield, and sets himself up to face the tutor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse, leaning close, blushed, feeling Earth’s small back and warmth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who is this Great Demon King! Really, you as well! You can’t be great heroes like your parents, if you just play make-believe, can you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not true! Fu is the best wizard in the world! Rebal is the best swordsman in the world! Phianse is the best spearmaster in the world! And I’m going to be the strongest ultra hero in the world, better than my father!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A child’s dream. But at that time, she didn’t doubt that they would really end up like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason is that there was a reliable leader pulling them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoo~oh, that’s a reliable one~… Then, can the ultra heroes of the future defeat the Great Demon King Katekyoshi and this devil Sadiz?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geh, S-Sadiz!? Why?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nofufufu~, I came to capture Little man who plays around and skips his homework~ ♪“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, leaders also have their weaknesses. There was a devil he couldn’t beat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth. you have to do it properly, or I’ll be mad too~!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, tha, uh, uh… that kind of!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… I… uh-oh, drool…… ahem. Well, I’m going home, Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U-uh… I, I see… I’m going home…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a case, you should protect yourself, so Phianse prepares to face the devil to defend Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth has fallen! I’ll defeat this devil myself!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Phianse!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come devil! I won’t let my friend go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They stand shoulder to shoulder and sometimes keep their backs together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse liked their relationship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, Fu, Rebal, Neo Heroes to battle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was sure from that time… from before then… it was natural for her to always be with the boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The future stayed the same for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not once had Phianse even doubted that this future was a definite matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth at that time…… he was innocent and mischievous…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After waking up from a nostalgic and happy dream, Phianse rose out of bed feeling refreshed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nearly ten years have passed since then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They no longer got together every day like they did when they were young, but she still believed that their bond has not changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come to think of it, we’ve been doing it a little since then… Fu’s talent, Rebal’s physical ability… Everyone is young, but gradually they begin to show a glimpse of talent… Me and Earth… we have something… I started to think so and I got impatient. Little by little, I had less time to play.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, on the other hand, Phianse knows that he is not as accessible as he used to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She understood that it is inevitable in the process of growth, but it still felt a little lonely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Especially… Earth, the leader of our neo-heroes, too… Little by little… started to hold the complex with the name of The Great Hero, Hiro… I made an effort to change the color of my eyes, but the expectations of the people around me were still heavy and I began to get frustrated… I began to demean myself… Hmm, when we entered the academy, when he called me ‘Princess’, I almost cried?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse looked out at the garden as she walked up to the window she once jumped out of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until ten years ago, everyone was there with Earth at the top.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no one had gathered there for years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… But… soon. Rebal and Fu are back. Earth has started to change a little recently, and he declared he will win the championship… yes. It’s okay. When we graduate, we’ll all be real warriors. Become Imperial Knights and once again, the neo-heroes will align!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The childhood friends were gradually becoming estranged, but Phianse believed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We will surely get together like we used to, and more respectable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, as real warriors, we will be able to continue to protect this empire and the peace of the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Even if… Rebal and Earth are going to fight over me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse knew it was necessary to settle things beyond the friendship with her childhood friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m proud of Rebal’s feelings, but… But I’m sure Earth… The other day, I found out that Earth likes me too… Even more, I want to win the championship and confess to him… But I wonder if Earth won now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse’s heart had already been decided in a sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, you can’t take down an important childhood friend who claims that ‘I want a chance’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, annoyingly, Phianse believes that Earth’s victory will be difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She knows Earth’s ability more than anyone in three years of the academy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Rebal, who boasted simple fighting power, has become much stronger during his study abroad this year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Phianse also felt that it would be difficult for him to win on his own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, if Rebal wins the championship…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haa… I’m also a sinful woman… because I’m making important childhood friends fight…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, she started training herself in preparation for the [Graduation Commemorative Match], but Phianse has not trained for a while because of the love affair between her childhood friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… And, I can’t brood over this situation forever. Anyway, after the upcoming game… Oh, if you want Earth, you can stay for one night… yes, let’s review his taste with this naughty book of Earth’s I got from that devil maid…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unaware of the Earth’s true intentions and the course he is starting to determine…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, the day will come.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am always indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, the power of the spiral was sent from you rapidly yesterday,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw the overall in the morning, we were in fourth place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t think I’ll be back on the cover for a day, so I’m completely naked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this a countdown to a million points?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In any case, it was very helpful. Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do my best every day this week! Aim for the heavens again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wait is almost over. The Graduation Match is just around the corner. Who else is excited! Glad you are all enjoying the story, I know I am. Look forward to seeing more from Earth and the most Bea of Demon Kings. On a side note, I finally released an end on year roundup video on my youtube channel. Hope you give it a look if you got 10 minutes to kill. Some stuff happened and I haven’t done this quite like I’d have wanted for the last couple years. But this year I put in the effort. Not my best, I’ll admit but I’ll never post it if I keep chasing perfection. So please give it a watch then like share and comment. Thanks.
