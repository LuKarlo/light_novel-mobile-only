<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He told me I shouldn't interfere, and I almost couldn't take it anymore, but then I realized I could only watch my brother, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thumped with my head at that ogre's attack, and my brother kept doing that until the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said that the reason why big brother went that far had to do with big brother's ogre friends that neither I nor Slayer-kun knew about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you're an older brother, it might be true that you have an ogre friend. But if that's the case, I'm jealous of your friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fact that you love your friend so much that he did that for you means that you love him enough to do that for him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't move my right knee ...... anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Captain, get a grip!　But ...... finally, that crazy person has stopped working!　Also, we'll take our ...... elves!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... Stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ...... Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No more ...... and I've defiled myself with all kinds of pride, but I can't take any more shame than this: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, Captain?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm losing ....... We're retreating here ......, but there's a good chance we won't be able to do that either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My brother was asleep, but the other ogres were trying to do something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and the Slayer thought that if something happened ...... but the blue ogre stopped them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you're going to run away, we're not ...... no ...... that's no good either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Chief, now's your chance!　The enemy numbers are down and the troop leaders look like that. All at once!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the other elves are sneaking around with their weapons to talk to the chieftain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ''You, in any case, this settlement has already been discovered by the Demon King's army. If we let those guys get away here ...... and more ...... next time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know ......, I know .......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, ...... that's what I mean. I don't know what your brother would think, but it happens all the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The retreating army was destroyed from behind ...... many times when I was in the coalition army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what the Chief, Eethe, and the other elves are going to do when they think of what's to come.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm sorry, miss ...... I'm sorry Bessah ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aonie, I don't think .........
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that point, the blue ogre seems to know all about it, and he's smiling like he's given up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then he apologizes once to his captive dark elf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then the dark elf saw that, too: ............
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'What?　Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?　Suddenly ...... buuuut, it's cold ......!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?　...... Espy!　This is ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh-huh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Slayer has noticed it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?　It's gotten really cold all of a sudden?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What's coming?　Something's coming!　Scary?　Scary!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... haha ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... I'm in trouble. ...... Not only might the next one be even stronger, but it's ...... a little too different dimension. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the chieftain chuckles and looks towards what's coming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ''Nuh-uh, this is ...... no way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wha-...... what ...... is ...... this intense pressure is ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both the blue ogre and the dark elf have noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something about ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dragon, get out of there!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the Chief suddenly shouted: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ga?　Gahu: ----
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「「「「「?!!!!」」」」」

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The head of one of the five fire dragons is missing: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm ...... peckish ...... I'm hungry, but not very well ...... I already have the ability to breathe fire, and I don't need flesh and blood ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then suddenly someone appeared with the head of a fire dragon ...... and ate?　But I quickly pecked away and threw my head to the side of it: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, it looks like you're in a lot of ...... trouble, ...... aonie. And I didn't know you even had Noja's men.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there is no shame in defeat. It's my own fault for letting you go out there alone this time. So I'll let you off the hook if you make the most of your failure to do so next time.

 Something came .......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's big and ...... no. Bigger than most people, but not that big compared to those blue ogres and other ogres. Even the muscles aren't muscular like those other ogres, they're not muscular like other ogres.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are they as big as normal people?　Like a human being. Just a little taller, but there were more muscular people in the Confederate army if they were that tall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His face also looks ...... something ...... young. But. It's not human.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's scary.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm scared. I'm scared!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked at me!
