 "Infinity Blade Cyclone!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, I was trying to show oniisan a good place by hanging out with Espi, but now they're desperate to resist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Live!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I produced countless blades, and the Espi manipulated them and released them from all directions, all the iron blades broke apart with one shout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you done playing with the toys?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With only a few engagements with Noja, I fully appreciated how powerful Rokkai was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not going to be the opponent now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew that. I knew it, but there's so much difference between Espi and the two of you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, they don't seem serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, hah... gu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a hunter, he defeated many monsters and bounty necks and was more or less confident in his power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, that confidence was shattered. This is all I've been doing since I met oniisan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially this time the dimensions are too different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now, is it better if you die and rot... or if you eat and become my flesh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the most powerful monster in Rokuha. White Demon Emperor Hakuki.

 "Ah... ah... Slaya-kun!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't resist... I can't stand up... I'll be killed.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... uhh, ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They're gonna kill me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not afraid to die anymore... but I've put my life to shame if it's easier to die... even though I'm scared...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ohh... oniisa..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No... I don't want to die...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on... I'll choose..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you're not hungry, don't kill. Don't eat."

 "... oh?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And don't let the woods and mountains ruin nature..." For those who are ravaging the world and ecosystems. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something suddenly came out of my back... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Québeye!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?! And birds!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ki, a giant weird bird grabbed my back and left me in the sky... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya!? What? Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happened at this time? Me, being attacked by a bird and grabbed? No, something's wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead, it's like the bird saved me now....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gahhhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gaaaaaaaa!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Grrrrrrrrrr!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm!? That's... wolves, wild grizzlies, fire dragons, red panthers and other fierce beasts and monsters from the woods surrounding the settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides the strange birds holding me in the sky, giant birds with sharp nails appeared one after the other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, why? It's full of animals...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!? Hey, what is this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know, to you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me, Espi, and the demon Aony, Dark Elves, and other augers are all confused by the sudden appearance of the beasts and monsters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah ~, I'm really... depressed..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That guy....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief surrounded the postcard with many animals and monsters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said... he understands animal language... even this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Birds, while we're earning time, let's get everybody together right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You think you can earn time or something?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a white flash spread out into the field of view.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eyes were taken away for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at that moment, the bird holding me suddenly burst into pieces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Inai reports that the Elves may have the same monster tamer as the legendary Swordsman Peachboy, Auger's natural enemy, but apparently so."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But even if it's a threat to war and my men, it's just a bunch of wild pride and lost fangs from me."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it's not just the birds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even if we take Cerberus and the monkey gods with us, as legends say, they're not my enemies!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dozens of animals and monsters gathered quickly turned the colony into pieces of flesh and into a sea of blood...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surrounding it with that number doesn't mean anything to the postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dragons and animals that are still alive don't let their anger fly, they're falling behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm afraid. In front of an overwhelming force that can't be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course... there are a lot of animals and monsters, but with this much, me and Espi... we don't even have hands or feet...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, what do we do? Are they gonna kill you? Can you eat it? Are we gonna get caught? My client said," If you resist, you can kill anyone but a young woman. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you get caught, you won't die for now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But maybe the days will come when you're better off dead... right? Hah... I'm sorry... animals"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, did the sheik's eyes change color?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's my fault... I'm sorry I let everyone die... but... this is the only one..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you ready to die and do something yourself? Oh, can you do anything but monster tamer?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... in my position... in the meantime, I have to scratch my feet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief himself is going to fight? Certainly, I feel like there is something about the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the other elves, I didn't see the power and I didn't think I understood it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... it's not just an elf... it's like Yamidiré, a heretic in the skies... something that the ancients of Sisonotami set up in the secession... but what happened to it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't. They'll kill me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... even if I didn't die... I don't want to humiliate my wife or anyone else."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Guys, right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief knows that. I can't win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at least we're trying to get them out of here... and we're... we're going to stop ourselves!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you ready? All right... after that, let's eat with Espi and Slaya and turn them into flesh and blood."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you can't. Stopping such a bug...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whose sister and brother are you trying to eat, you perverted bastard!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, oniisan suddenly got up from the blind corner of the postcard that was about to attack the chief, and started the upper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, oniisan, even though you were in such a state..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan woke me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I put my fist on my postcard face... no...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gu, ahh, ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan who beat me is twisting his face... and the postcards aren't moving at all. On the contrary, you're laughing!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, oh, my, my fist is crushing... what a stiff guy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan smiles bitterly while suppressing his fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes... so did I... when I was cut with a sword made of iron, I couldn't get a single scratch on my postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'd rather attack myself in front of that strong flesh....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, it's a lot of nerve to punch me with your fist without a weapon. Besides, the bones in the fist that I hit are not broken, so I'm pretty well trained. Though it's been a long time, don't nod until you've caught up with Aony like that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ghh, nyahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But I'm not feeling calm. I was hoping they'd attack me right after I regained consciousness without checking the situation."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uuuuuuuu... I can't imagine the chatty auger... but I don't know what the situation is... who is this guy... what's he gonna do with the same kitten as Aony... hmm?... to? What?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan, you're so worn out, you're about to fall... and you don't know who you're dealing with...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!? Really!? This guy!? Wait a minute, why!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? But I'm surprised to be alone... talking to myself... what's the matter? Did you notice the postcard?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, either way....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oniisan, no! That's a different level! That's... the most powerful postcard in Rokkai!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, don't fight!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, oniisan can't win in such a state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, hah... ah... let's see... I'm just saying," Listen, "but, uh, now that you've met one of the six, what's the matter? Yamidiré, Palippi, Noja... Rokkaha is already full of hunger."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Are you seeing all three of them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Besides... no matter how big it is, no matter how big it is, no matter how powerful it is in legend... Six Heights is the strongest... even if it's stronger than the hero Hyiro of" Now "... in the end it's weaker than the Great Demon King Traina! I don't know, I have to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh? This one has... good eyes. What's your name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan, why don't you run away? On the contrary, are you going to fight like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't! At least we can.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniisan was beaten from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was completely unexpected, oniisan fell to moro, and fell to the ground again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that's not a postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's wrong... Aony?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's wrong with letting me do it like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The blue auger that beat oniisan from behind and stunned him again was Aony, who stood up with one foot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a coward he is. How dare you admit defeat!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is the only way to do it... nevesa..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "General... this is... this is not the only one... I can't kill right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
