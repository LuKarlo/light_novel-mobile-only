 Normally, he would have been trying to compete with Espy to show his brother the good side of things, but now they were both struggling to resist.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But ......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I created countless blades and Espy manipulated them and released them at my opponent from all directions, all of the iron blades shattered with a single yell.

 Are you done playing with toys?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having engaged in even the slightest of battles with Noja, I've experienced the full extent of the power of the Six Horsemen in my own body.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm no match for Bok now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew that. I knew it, and yet, even if it took two people, Espy and I to make this much of a difference?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the other guy doesn't seem to be taking it seriously.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ha, ha, ha, ha ...... goooo ......'

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a hunter, he had defeated numerous monsters and bounty hunters and was somewhat confident in his own strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, that confidence was shattered. Ever since I met your brother, this is all I've seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially in this case, the dimensions are too different.

 'Then. Would you rather die and become rotting flesh ...... or be eaten and become my flesh and blood ......?

 Suddenly, something hit me on the back: ...... What?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kukeeeee!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'What?　And the birds!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A giant monster bird grabbed me by the back and flew straight into the sky ......?

 'Slayer!　Huh?　Why?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happens now?　Was I attacked and kidnapped by a bird?　No, there's something different about the atmosphere.

 Grrrrrr!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?　It is ...... Surrounding Hakuki, wolves, wild grizzlies, fire dragons, red panthers and other ferocious beasts and monsters are appearing one after another from the forest surrounding the settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in addition to the monstrous birds holding me in the sky, giant birds with shiny, sharp claws are appearing one after another.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both Boku and Espy, as well as that ogre named Aonie, the dark elf and the other ogres, are confused by the sudden appearance of the beasts and monster horde.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chief!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief surrounded Hakki with many animals and monsters.

 That man ...... said he could understand the language of animals, but ...... this kind of thing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But ......

 'Birds, while we're buying time, we need everyone to go to ---- right now.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you think you could buy me some time?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a white flash of light spread across my vision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It took me a moment to catch my eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in that instant, the bird that had been holding me suddenly shattered into pieces as if it had burst.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ''From Inai's report, I harbored the possibility that the elves had the same monster tamer as the ogre's natural enemy, the legendary swordsman Peach Boy, but it looks like it's true.

 You: "You: ............

 Most of all, a threat to the war and to my men, but to me, it's just a bunch of lower races that have lost their wild pride and fangs.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it's not just the birds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Even if, like the legends, you take Cerberus and the monkey gods with you, they are not my enemies!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dozens of the gathered animals and monsters turned into pieces of flesh in an instant, without a moment's resistance, without a moment's roar, turning the settlement into a sea of blood. ......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, .......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surrounding them in that many numbers would mean nothing against Hakki.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the dragons and animals still alive have backed away, not even pouncing on them in anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They are afraid. In the face of an overwhelming force that can't be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder ...... there are so many animals and monsters, sure, but this is about as much as Bok and Espy can do ...... when even those Boks can't do a thing about it.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So?　What do we do?　Is he gonna kill me?　Can he get you?　Will you be caught dead?　According to the request, all but the youngest girls are allowed to kill me if I resist.

 'But there may be days when it's better to be dead. ...... right?　Haha ...... sorry ...... animals.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it?　Did the sheikh's eyes change color?

 "I'm sorry ...... for making everyone die because of me, but ...... he's the only one ...... who can't get away with it.

 "Are you willing to do anything to deserve it?　Huh, what else can you do besides monster tamer?

 ...... I'm in a position to go to ......, but I've got some legwork to do.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is the sheik himself going to fight?　Certainly, there is something about the Chieftain that makes me feel like there is something about him.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the other elves, he couldn't see or understand their powers, nor did he think he could.

 But ......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see, ...... I'm still not just an elf, ...... like Yamidire, who was a heretic among the celestial race, ...... something set up by the Sisonotami ancients in the Sisonotami by a secession, but so what.

 We can't do this. We're going to die!

 'Are you ready? Okay, ...... torture him, then I'll eat him with Espy and Slayer and turn him into flesh and blood.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just then, Hakki was about to attack the chieftain when his brother suddenly got up from his blind spot and delivered an uppercut.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Brother!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Oh, oh, brother, you were in that state, and now you're already ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your brother woke me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a fist to Hakki's face ...... no ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The older brother who punched him contorted his face ...... vs. Hakki is not as if he is unfazed. On the contrary, he's mocking her!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The older brother chuckles as he suppresses his fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right ...... so was I. ...... When I slashed at him with a sword made of forged iron, I didn't get a scratch on the hack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before that solid body, I was the one who attacked him: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You have a lot of guts to attack me with your fists without even holding a weapon. On top of that, the bone in your fist that you hit is not broken, that's pretty well trained. It's quite an ugly face, but no wonder you caught Aonie up to the point where she was in that state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you look a little restless. You just regained consciousness and then attacked me without checking the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shut up ...... talkative ogre, I don't know what's going on, but ...... who the hell is this guy... ...The same kittehs as Aonie: ...... hmm?　Go to ......?　What?

 Brother, you're so battered and bruised that you could fall over if you poked him a little ...... and you don't even know who you're dealing with ......?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'What?　Really!　This guy?　Wait, what, why?!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?　But something startled me all by itself: ...... What's going on?　You noticed Hakuki?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nope, either way: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, brother, no!　That guy's on another level!　That's ...... the strongest hackneyed hackney in the Sixth Dynasty!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Big brother, stop fighting!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, there's no way you can win with your brother in that state.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha, ha, ...... Yeah,...... it looks like. I'm also 'listening' ...... now, but what's wrong with me now that I've met one of the six people. Yamidire, Paripi, Noja...... I'm already full of the Six Horsemen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?　Have you met all three of them?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh?　This is some ...... good eye. What's your name?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You want to run, big brother?　On the contrary, you're going to fight like that?

 But I can't!　At the very least, we too can go to ......

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?

 And that's when it happened.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Brother!'

 Oh, my brother was hit from behind.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was totally unexpected, the brother was morosely hit and fell to the ground with a slam again.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it wasn't a hack.

 'What's up ...... it's Aonie,'

 Ha, ha, ha. ......

 I didn't have to let him do it. What's going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a blue ogre named Aonie who stood up on one leg and knocked her brother out again by hitting him from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That guy, what a coward. How dare he admit defeat!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here's what I'm going to do: ...... nevertheless.
