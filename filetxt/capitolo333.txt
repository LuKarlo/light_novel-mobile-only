<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember being beaten suddenly from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it might be because of the mind, but it didn't feel like an attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'd rather...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. Aony tried to protect you. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina? What are you talking about... he's the one who insulted Aka...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You should have known. Aony's words weren't genuine. He tried to test you by stretching his body. I wonder if you have real friendship with Aka. And that's why he saved his life. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was able to escape a certain distance. Of course, even a massive mountain hunt would still be dangerous, but the postcard will not. I'm a brutal man, but I'll miss out on my men trying to fulfill their lives this time... even if I'm a traitor to my clan. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, finally, a dazzling light is pouring into the dark world of consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, this is a sign of waking up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, after what happened, I had to sort it out again...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's good for you, ahhhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Niiiiiiiiii!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bhee!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wake up slowly... without any trouble, my sister and brother dive into my belly and I wake up in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great, oniichan ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't worry about me at all. I hope we're all safe."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of you come and hug me with a relieved smile and tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... calm down..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yadaaaaahh, I can't fall apart ~ ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhhh, what's up, niisan, you're disturbing us even though we're so worried?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, yes, yes, both of you are cute."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stroke their heads with both hands and look around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wasteland in the foothills surrounded by mountains?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elves in the settlement cut trees to make simple houses, and elves with weapons on rocky mountains look around and act as if they were watching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, oniisan, you're awake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain... this is..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, things forced me to move. Unless you live here like this. It doesn't look like it's a mess away from our former settlement, it looks inconvenient, and even though it's surrounded by rocky mountains, it's easy to find because it's quite close to the environment where humans live...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moving. That means we've all fled the settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the hand of the postcard.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well done on getting away."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, about two... help me"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I remembered the conversation I had with Traina in my consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really... Aony..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He bought us time to escape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why you're really risking your life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? But they're both...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, that's... that way"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of them helped him escape the postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If one of them is Aony, looking back at who the other is, there is a woman staring at me with her arms braced in the shade behind the diagonal tree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... Ralviv..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... are you happy? I can't go back to the Demon King army anymore...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dark Elf Ralwyf under Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the restraint has been released, I am very much at ease.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You betrayed the Devil's Army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Aony... Aka... her parents lived in the dark elves where the elementary school students lived."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aka-san!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised and convinced by Ralviv's sudden words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was that so after all?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really... after all, you and Aka-san..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought "hello" from the way he reacted when he saw the stone accessories I got from Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The elementary students... were childhood friends... they were different races... but together since childhood... the strong and powerful Aony was like a brother... and..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralph talks about the two of us while remembering the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That look was called a dark witch, and it wasn't the look that made us hate each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just think of a man, and....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But, more than anybody... than anybody... my smile gives me so much peace of mind... when the junior is tough or sad, it feels like it's about me together... no..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that's the guy. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded unexpectedly and at the same time knew how much he cared about Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just one thing... tell me. Is Aka... alive?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't say much about history. However, at least that much...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahh... I don't know where I am right now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still itchy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka is alive. And now that the war is over, I've been hiding in the mountains near the Empire's Honeybo for more than a decade... so maybe even now... but if I tell him that, history will come back...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Akaah... you're alive...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was Ralviv enough just to talk about his survival, and he sat there with no tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy's never heard of Aka before.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Absolutely... how ridiculous... the junior didn't suspect the death of the man he truly loved... he didn't believe he was alive... unilaterally summoned revenge... and these hands of the junior... were so bloody that he refused... that he never deserved to see me again."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Never again... hey, you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm just... glad you're alive... really glad..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see... I didn't know that Aka had such a crush on her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, Aka-san... he's a sinner after all."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka, next time I see you, I'll give you a little sermon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crying at a woman who's been thinking so much about herself....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Boomerang!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fuck, I noticed it myself!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn it... it's just... Either way, I want to see Aka-san..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What Ralph did to the humans... that's not what I'm talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I want both of you to do something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Somehow... I felt like I was being entrusted... to Aony to help me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I guess so..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also looked at the distant sky, and I couldn't help but feel my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And naturally, I started to cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... it's heavy... to be protected with my life at stake... that's what this is about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah. You've carried... your thoughts of life... and don't forget the weight, child."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted to talk to Aony a little bit more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid bastard... if you die... you can't do anything... with Aka-san... with you... eh... you can't do it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you help unilaterally, didn't you say thank you, and besides, left it to yourself?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're kidding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I feel like I've been entrusted by myself, and I'll try to do something about the entrusted "something".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You saved my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
