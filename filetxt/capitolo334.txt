 "Iron Shining Ultimate Nails! Darkness Burst Hammer!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya moved on to create temporary housing on the move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Boo, Slaya, I've been thinking about this for a long time, but it's too much! It's just nails and tongs!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You have too little taste in naming! Basically, you're just piling up trees and stuff while saying" creates "!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even Slaya is just like Shining and Darkness, but it's all normal!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... don't you see the difference? This is why the child....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were arguing with Gaga, but they were working for the elves with the power they could hold somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The elves, who initially had only vigilance and hostility towards people called humans, gradually faded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, huh, hey, Espy... Slaya, right? I'm still working... why don't you eat some bread and take a break?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eat!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, that's a bad espionage! Don't eat my food!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha, there's still plenty. Come on, ours too...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow! It was delicious, but this one is also delicious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You have no taste at all... ah, yummy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were kids, and above all, they both stood up to protect the elves. And cute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, Espi! Slaya, don't panic. Eat well! I won't lose or take anything else!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, yes..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahaha, Miss Eteye looks exactly like your mother."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, it's not like that! Don't get me wrong because I don't think it would be like this if I had a child, or if I wanted a child too soon! Ah, well, but it's not like I don't want a child..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, everyone nods that they will gradually open their minds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't think it would be strange to be depressed or in a dark atmosphere by wearing clothes from where I used to live, but seeing the children's spies and slayer still working hard, it seems that the elves are gradually regaining their brightness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... so what are you gonna do? Dark Elf's sister."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I asked Ralwyev, who was sitting beside me while I was leisurely being treated, and the chief was sitting there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... how about...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're not going back to the Demon King Army anymore, are you? You're going back to the magic world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... no... that too..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, that Aka from your first love? Are you looking for an auger?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralph shakes his shoulders slightly in Aka's name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that's all I cried about knowing that Aka was alive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it's true, you want to go and see him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... I can't... do that. By the time I met Aka... the pups were too dirty for blood... and the dozens and twenty I killed wouldn't fit in. The elementary school student is shy of himself....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a war... but there's no excuse, Ralph looks back and feels guilty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka stopped fighting humans and wanted to be friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Ralwyev has killed, tortured, robbed and ravaged so many people, as he did in Genkan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just rest assured. I will not return to the Demon King army. I don't talk about elves either. I swear on Aony's life. Let's get the elementary students out of here right away."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you won't guess where you're going, will you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still. It's the end of the road that suits juniors to die in the wilderness....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what Ralph said, and he dropped his face so he could plug in again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, while I can't say anything trivial about that heavy appearance, I couldn't leave Aoney as a childhood friend who saved her life above all else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know... let me tell you... either way... it's all the same thing."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the chief told him so, exhaling with astonishment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without understanding the meaning of the chief's words, when Ralviv and I leaned our heads, the chief....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know all the voices of the animals that live in this world. Dragons, beasts, birds, insects, fish, monsters. I always get eaten like that... I always hear the screams of my life dying of a weak predator... Well, some of them got along, but... they're not... they can't change the habits of the beasts who have to eat meat and vegetables. That's why, if you hear that scream, all the humans, demons, and wars will remain the same. To eat. To live. However, in your case, there are a few reasons to kill, such as justice, vengeance, feelings that nature doesn't have."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've heard that before when Trayna was talking about the magic of Mutsuagouro. At least I can't eat meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. If I hear a call from a cow or a pig saying, "Help me," I'll be worried about everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is always a chief in such a world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, they understand all the screams of life screaming in the weak predators of nature.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From such a chief, they are all the same who kill each other in war.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oneesan, oniisan. I have a question for you... at the end of the war... what do you think of the world if oniisan doesn't have a demon tribe in the world and becomes only a human... onee-san doesn't have a human in the world and becomes only a demon tribe?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought about the question for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't believe it's a peaceful world without disputes...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... when it's just a world of humans, we fight each other... when it's just demons, we fight each other... that's the world."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Ralviv said so with a harsh expression, and I missed him, but I was convinced of the answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief nodded and raised his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's the world after all. It won't change after a hundred years or a thousand years. Wherever you go, it's just a struggle... tragedy and a scream... which means that what oneesan did, even if some of the people on the wrong side are making noise, it's normal in the world, and at least in this time of the world, I think it's too much trouble."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid... it's supposed to be normal... how filthy the juniors are already..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Both humans and demons, of course, if we open the lid of our elves, we'll all be dirty. Elves are a supreme species, and some of them boast about looking down on other species, so it's too tough. But somehow, oneesan had a slight skirmish with us, but on the contrary, if oneesan's magic saved us all this time, we can think of Chara as more than a benefactor point."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know about the last one anymore. It's a theory, but somehow....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In other words, the chief is going to Ralwyev... so you can stay here for a while if you don't guess. Don't be depressed... you've done a lot of things in the war, but I don't care... do you want to tell me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I'm sorry, I didn't know what to say along the way... but that's probably where it is. Everyone said that when onee-san was a prisoner, she was executed and tortured, but there must have been a lot of upset about this. A man who fights to defend himself with his life and becomes a fool for the Fae... an organ who stands up with his heart moved... and a dark elf who helps everyone... children who work with innocent eyes... We elves were attacked this time, but we couldn't do anything. Everyone... feels so powerless and so cramped that I think things will change."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, my God."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed unexpectedly. But I guess so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma ~, didn't you want to help oniisan as well as that blue auger? We're the elves."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aony....?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, you said that. Listening to oniisan's story..." Think about how you'll live from now on, and live again as you want "..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... nh......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was fainting... sure, when I heard that word, I realized that Aony was trying to help Ralph, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see... then...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Ralvie."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know where Aka is right now, but... at least... what happened when I met Aka, what kind of story I talked about, what kind of play I played... if I could just talk about memories...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!? Aka's...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won't say anything about history, but there's still something I can teach you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then at least that's all.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... please... tell me. Memories of you and Aka..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On my proposal, Ralviv nodded honestly with tears in his eyes again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
