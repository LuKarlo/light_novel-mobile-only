 "It was Aka who ran away, got lost in the woods, couldn't even reach out to the mushrooms and rabbits that fell in the area, and appeared to starve to death."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the escape from the postcard, I told you about that time in the gradually calming air, with no particular chasers coming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I said," Aug!? Are you serious!? "What an awesome sight to enter a state of war, someone with a body like that giant Aony..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu, that sounds like an idiot... but even though it's strong, it's a little timid."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "On the contrary, you're telling me," Are you hungry? "or" It's bad for humans "... I met an auger for the first time in my life, and I said," This is the auger!? "I thought... well, it's a preconceived one."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... I don't think so. That's what happens when a human encounters an auger in the woods all of a sudden."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, the house in the back of the woods that you took me to ~, it's a small one made of handmade fields and a certain tree, and if you go inside, fine sculptures and accessories... oh, by the way, I got what I showed you just then. So, tell me to cook mess ~ When I stood in the kitchen, swing the knife and the frying pan gorgeously, and you behaved like a mess with me. No, I traveled a lot, but the meat dishes I ate at that time were really good."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, he certainly was clever, but sooner or later, he made fields and cooked?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, well, when I say horse, it makes me snuggle ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The memories of me and Aka. Even though I was listening a little further away, I noticed that Ralwyev got out and listened to me. Yeah, he nodded and his face was a little weak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hee ~, there was such an auger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, it's totally different from the people who attacked our settlement!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aka-san, you're a good man! I want to see you too!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're a strange auger....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the chief, his wife, Espi and Slaya stopped working and sat around me, and...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, oniisan. Did you get along with Aka?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, so?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Go on, tell me ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized it, the other elves were gathered around me to listen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's crazy, but I wanted everybody to know more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 About Aka-san... that there is such an auger...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aka said she wanted to be friends with humans... cook, play acer games and get along... so I played acer all night."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, of course, it wasn't just fun memories.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, Aka said she wanted to eat cake... so I went to town to buy cake for her help... but while I was shopping for cake..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Otherwise... my heart hurts...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A group of hunters... attacked Aka..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When I came back... my house and my fields were burning..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you say Ninja Warrior here, it will be confusing again, so it's a bunch of hunters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya! Hunters are so bad!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, wait, even if I tell you...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Slaya, are you a hunter!? Look, you can't just grow up attacking somebody like that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, um, Mr. Ete....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kh... you human... you're still a human and an auger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone's getting emotional.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone is seriously angry about what happened to Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But don't point that spear at Slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, but... in that flame... it was the hunters who fell... and Aka-san finally retaliated against me. Aka-san was strong."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "Oh, oh, Mr. Akashi! Gentle and well cooked... and strong!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, of course. Aka can't beat such a crook!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But Aka was crying in that flame. I was... sad... and angry because of the cowardly people. Because I was nicer than anyone else, I kept putting up with a lot of things, and I got angry because of that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Aka-san, there's nothing wrong with that!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, what a hunter! I'm ashamed to be the same hunter!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And on the contrary, I'm going to stick my fist up and be glad... you guys just fell in love with Aka-san for a while? I'm glad to hear that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So nice. I was going to... let Aka-san's anger blow away... and fight."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Why!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha, looks like oniichan... is that it? That means oniisan, so I can't believe the technique I used at that time...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, Aka's messy punch and mine...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Headbud!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah, ahh, let's hit it off."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've been fighting a lot of them since that day. Every time I fought that fierce battle, and since then, I've been practicing again and again, and I think I've become stronger than I was on that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I still use Aka's power at that time as a reference on various occasions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was my strong, heavy, and big fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "From there, my head is already stupid... and Aka and I bumped into each other from the front. Yes... like a collision with today's Aony, try to expose everything inside your heart."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still have a headache when I remember now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But because of that....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And even if I did that... after all, Aka was Aka. Restore your sanity... instantly tears and begs me to apologize again and again... for being like each other. But... good and bad, I knew each other... and I thought I could be real friends with Aka-san at that moment."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But soon afterwards....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
