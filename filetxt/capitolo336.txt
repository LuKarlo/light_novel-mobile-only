<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was angry with Aka's kindness and treatment, but when they were able to make up, they were happy, and when they realized that there were no more people moving to work, they were all listening to my memories.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we talked until that morning.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, hiccup... when you're with me... because you're bothering me... because you're my friend... leave a letter... and Aka's body is nowhere to be found anymore..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I realized that I was crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was just talking about the moment I read that letter that morning, I was overwhelmed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "Uh-oh, aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of them were crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's pretty good, Aka-san, even though I didn't do anything bad ~..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, you're a kid at all. I can't believe you're crying right now. I can't... guru... no, I can't even cry..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Good auger... no, good man... you were a good person."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gusun, ahh, no more. I wanted to hate all the orgasms....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a sweethearted auger..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mother, I'm not afraid of August-san anymore! The sneaking augers are bad people, but they're good augers too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Me too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's right. Not just Augusta, but people like Oniisan, Espi, and Slaya. Not all of them are Demon Kings, not all of them bokumates."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's too simple. The strange sight of all the elves who looked down on other races with their heads and said they hated their hair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... that sounds like an idiot..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralviv smiled at me with tears in his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still... still, Aka... must have been glad to see you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ralviv....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Elementary school students... Aony... and family are all trapped in war and hatred... that's why I can meet someone like you who treats me like a human and hits me from the front without fear..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I guess so..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Aony must have figured it out with you. That's why you must never let him die..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I remembered what Trainer said that day, looked at the Trainer beside me, and Trainer smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --This is no consolation, child. That orga must have really been saved by meeting you. You could definitely be his friend. That's why he disappeared from front of you. You don't know the world. I don't know the bottom of people and demons. He is also weak. But... still, you're human and you made a friendship with Augu. I've never seen anyone like them before. Really, you did good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I was helpless, Aka took care of me and disappeared from my front.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, Aka said it was nice to meet me.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why the words said at the same time.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I may say harsh things, but the public eye for variants is not as sweet as you think. He left you because he knew it better than anyone. You don't think it has anything to do with the eyes around you? Don't make me laugh. No matter how powerful you are about the world, people, or demons, there is no basis for what you say. I can't trust you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What about me now? Even if I make a strong statement, I'm a little...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "At least... you're not lying to me personally... I'm sure you have that kind of trust."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to my question, Traina gave me a point of appreciation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a little better from that time on, and I felt a little saved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't even bear my share of Aony... Ralph... each other"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh... that's right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither I nor Ralph realized that the Aony's thoughts entrusted to us by life could ever be wasted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, you must find Aka-san!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! If anything happens, I can help!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Slaya-kun is cheating! I'll be the one! Aka, I'm the one who's pissing them off!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when Espi and Slaya, who were completely obsessed with my story, followed me and nodded, I laughed again and nodded that it was true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All right, Dark Elves! You too... find Aka-san and make him happy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that's right!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, Aka-san is so pitiful! Go to the side and support him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the excited elves thought about Aka's happiness one after the other and told Ralviv to do his part.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Ralvif shook his head sadly at the words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't... no matter what they say to the elementary school students right now... there's no need to listen to Aka... the elementary school students... women like elementary school students..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what Ralviv said. He dropped his shoulders and leaned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After hearing Aka's story from me, he felt sad that he was not worthy enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, you know... saving someone and making amends over the people you killed..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, you don't have to make amends, do you? You're at war with each other, and you don't think this guy's bad in the first place, do you? Even if you suffer from what you did... then you won't have to make amends or shit."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... that might be so..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was at war, but I didn't want to pay for the people I killed."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, each other. Both. War in this era is not about which is right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I don't want to make amends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it is not easily divided.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the meantime, I don't know how to make amends, but if you're who you are now... why don't you just try living like that? I don't know."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, there are no answers, but we still have to live. To reward Aony.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe that's why the chief is right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I met Aka, I didn't feel that Ralwyev and Aka had already met again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know if I'm looking for Aka in the world in a few decades, or if I haven't seen her yet....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Those answers... I'll be one step ahead..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how worried I am now, history has already been decided.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then all I can do is go and see what happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, back in time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
