<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few days after the postcard attack, my injuries have gotten much better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In my memories, it seemed like the distance between Elves and us and Ralph had changed slightly because they were exposed to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before the Augurs attacked, the words "Execute," "Torture," and "Hostage," used to fly around, but nobody talks about them anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that my eyes have changed to include fighting against us and Aony. Now, I am usually treated like a benefactor, well, I don't feel bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It feels like a clap of applause, but Ralph won't be here anymore, and now he looks calm and stays here until he feels rested.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yoo-hoo, with the help of the forest animals and birds, we've almost completed the map... the more... nh... ah, no good. This is the closest river to me....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while everyone was working on the temporary housing installation again, the chief of the clan talked to the bird that sat on the rock by himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If it's just for a few days, I've managed to fetch water just for the men... but it's hard to do this forever. Besides, when it comes to birds, it seems that travelers and hunters sometimes pass by around here... it's dangerous..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is temporary, and we can't live here forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Before, in addition to just a good place, there was a magic of cognitive inhibition in the surroundings... but even so, the higher-level ones found out... hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You... by the way, our settlement..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just to be clear... it's already been destroyed... rather than letting the elves escape... I guess I tried to find it... by the hands of that Augusta..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right. Now that they're gone, I'm going home again... I can't do this anymore..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Previously, elves lived in places like hidden settlements, where people and demons rarely went through, but they can't do that anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it is not so easy to find a place in an environment like the previous one that cannot be found by people or the Demon King Army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The war between the Demon King army and mankind will end in a future not so far from history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Demon King Army is not like this, and for the elves, engaging with humans is backwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though they sort of figured it out with us, there are people like the bokumates. The bokumates' family will be destroyed long ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even elementary school students can use it to inhibit recognition... to secure water and food..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah... and even if I had to disguise my fields and go shopping in the city, all the residents would have their share ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The wildlife around here... ah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... it will eventually happen... except for me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There seems to be a culture in which elves hunt and feed their lives, so naturally they can't even secure food that way. Except for the chief who can't eat meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still, it feels like at most two to three days of camping life... to make it our own quarters..." Ah, Mendokusai... hey, Dark El... can't you magically build a river with Ralwyev and his brothers?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, elementary school students, the magic of water attributes is....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As much as the earth attribute and thunder... if you dig earth and water comes out..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Neither can I."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, I can't do it anymore. Ah... there's nothing I can do ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So the chief lay down on his back on the rock as if he had been unwilling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you! Can't you handle it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I wonder what you can do about it, the chief's usual ideas and inventions...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wives and other elves who ask for salvation from such a chief, but the chief shook his head as he did so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't say that easily... but I originally told you not to fight before the Augusta attacked you... hah... I'll think about it for a second. Seriously, it's a matter of life and death... hah... bumps... at a time like this... I don't know... bumps... why I dropped the" key "... but either way... it's going to be complicated... ah ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Quite a difficult problem. But we have to do something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief is trying to be rash, but his expression seems to be seriously worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't live in an environment where so many people can't find me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Traina peeked into the map made by the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, well... I still forgot the best, the biggest, the strongest minds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina has a good idea....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to be around here anymore... so that's it...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, but the word "traina" is no good... so, I guess it's really no good. So how will these elves be in the future.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean... there's a way to buy land..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how much we fought on the ground, we still didn't have all the gaps. War or war, I didn't touch the meaningless lands... except in this great forest and mountainous area... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, no, maybe so....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are also untouched lands in the world that are only owned by individuals. It can also be bought and turned into private land to prohibit entry except for related parties. My title as the Seven Braves of Espi... Besides, if I have the credibility as Slaya's Hunter, I'll have no problem loading up the gold. If you use both names to block entry, it's rare for anyone else to break in. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Buy land? I've never thought about that since I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, but even the money... what about the money? They're all dressed up. No matter how much the chief secretly earned as a writer, there is no money now... even for me now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, when I said I'd buy land or mountains, nobody had enough money to buy them... I remembered something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... speaking of which..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, you have the money. In the city of Vienna... you deposited most of the huge money you earned from horse racing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. I suppose you filled up the bags and kept everything but the money you needed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, there are depository offices all over the world, wherever a debit is processed -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, I'm paying for it!? No, I can't help but have that money...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then why don't you lend it to me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lend it to me......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why the Distinguished Series is selling quite well on the ground... that is, even if I write a sequel now, I will also have a large income for the chief...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh... if you give it back in a dozen years... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was just listening to Traina, and one question crossed my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think the chief wants to write a sequel to the Distinguished Series... no way...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then it was time!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly the air trembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like a postcard appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is it!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, hey, check it out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, there was an anomaly in the sky even farther from the forest where we are now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is it!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... what? I feel so powerful... the birds... the forest animals are surprised...!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An extra-large pillar of light stretching from the earth to the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, what the hell!? Is the sky... cracked!? What is that huge light!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pillars emit intense light around them, dazzling us in a remote place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, what is it... that...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, what do you think?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espy and Slayer are also in position.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You just ran into that postcard, and you're telling me there's something else?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina, that... what do you think it is? Is that... magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel it on my skin without using radar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong, giant pillars of light stretching through the clouds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But such magic.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked if Trayna might know anything, but she didn't return anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back at what happened.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A few days after the Hakuki attack... in the meantime, there were reports of Aoney's death... oh, really... the next day... and then there were reports... of a violent earthquake in the demon kings army..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trainer was staring at a pillar of light penetrating the distant sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've never seen such a trainer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hesitate to speak up.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah, no... don't worry, kid. Although I can see it, the source of that light is far from here... nothing's wrong."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, is that so? But what the hell is that light...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah. That light... came from the collision of two enormous forces... a coalition army that had been semi-destructed... Hyiro has risen from the abyss of death and is at war with the Demon King army in that land."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that your father?! Besides... you're at war with the Demon King Army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a long way away... but you can still see the force with your naked eyes from here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a joke....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "For now... you don't have to worry about it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't worry about it. That's what Trainer said, but something is wrong with Trainer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 * Giggle * at the distance.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... you were one of the rest of my pride... fight with no regrets... and sleep in peace... gouda..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't hear what the murmur was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
