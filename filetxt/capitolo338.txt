<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna said, for now, we don't mind ignoring the huge light that has appeared in distant places.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what do I have to do now....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!? Oniisan's buying us some land!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, that sounds like the fastest way to do it. If you're talking about private land in Espy or Slaya, you don't have the courage to enter it without permission, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, land... ah, oniisan... baby?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, stop saying that. I earned it myself... ah, it's a lot of money..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was bewildered by the boulders, including the chief, on my proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bought land and suddenly I was told to live there, and I said, "Huh?".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But I can't get a lot of money to buy such land....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not like it's for free. You can return it later. I don't need any interest."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I mean, I owe oniisan... no, but I don't know..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You don't have to think so hard. At the very least... I hope you'll continue with the Distinguished Series for a dozen more years."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, more than a dozen years... what kind of masterpiece is that?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief is surprised by my jokes, but the chief actually keeps writing novels for over a decade now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the novel may also be important to me and Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha... I didn't know I was involved in the sequel to the Distinguished Series."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day I met Treina. I didn't know how to deal with the existence of the Great Demon King's ghost, but it was because of that novel that I changed my mind and became emotional about Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't help but feel a strange fate when I thought that the book that inspired it was connected to the future because of my involvement in the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Trainer...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah, ah, that's right... hmm? What's the matter with you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... no......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, she waved it to Trainer, but her heart didn't seem to be here at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though you told me not to worry about it, you still care about that pillar of light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can guess about all sorts of things...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But if I give it back someday... oniisan, where's the land..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah... that's..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I would like Trainer to tell me a lot about what's going to happen, and with that in mind, I called Trainer's name several times....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... hmm. Land... yeah... get out of the woods and take the streets a little... well, as a first priority when you move around... there are a few small mountains ahead of the old Sisonotami. That's definitely the kingdom of Japone... huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ruins of Sisonotami. That is the place I should aim for in this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But do we have to cross Shisonotami once to solve the problems of the Elves' land?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, as long as I have a certificate to withdraw the money from the depository, it doesn't have to be me... so I can't leave the rest to you...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the goal was a shisonotami, there's no rush.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little more journeys with Espi and Slaya....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... ah!? I see... have you done anything else!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee? Oniisan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly Trainer next to me shouted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surprised by the unexpected voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The last thing I did... is a child. Our journey is destined for Sisonottami... but isn't it over when we go to Sisonottami?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it was something, but I know it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Go to the ruins of Sisonotami....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ruins aren't deserted!? The Demon King Army and the Allies took it and kept taking it back... which means either army was always based until the end of the war!? How are you going to break into the ruins in such a state!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was relieved to hear that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I avoided going to the ruins in the future because Noja and Hu's father were going at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In contrast, which army is stationed in this era?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, if we don't sneak into the ruins in the eyes of the army....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there is a time when the only ruins of our time are deserted for a short period of time. It's... the Gouda army stationed in Sisonottami... fighting against the impending alliance of Gouda and your father Hiiro on the plains near Sisonottami... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And Gouda died in battle. The remnants of the Gouda army stationed in Sisonottami retreated... and confirmed it, and the next day the Allies entered Sisonottami, which became unmanned, and the Allies recaptured Sisonottami from the Demon King army..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ho, ho..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I've studied the history of those places. It's also in the textbook, and it's the first time humankind has beaten up a corner of the Roku-ha Great Demon General.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? But then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, today Gouda died! I have no chance of breaking into the ruins of Cissonotami except today! If you miss today, tens of thousands of Allied troops will enter Sisonotami and fly the flag!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh!? Well then, the light just shined.... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But today, all of a sudden... you're talking about the land... and you're telling me you left it to the Espirs? No, I can't believe it's so sudden with Espi and Slaya in the first place...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ...... So... you want me to send you ahead? Until the war is over..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I finally figured out why Traina was in such a hurry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, if I miss today, I won't be able to leave until the war is over...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, what's wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No... well, that's nothing... and even if I say the war is over, it's not far into the future...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you think so... I feel like I can't stay in this era forever and keep getting involved behind history...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, while trying not to get involved, I got involved with Espi, who is also the seven heroes, and met Kojiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regarding Rokuha, we also met Noja and Hakuki, and were also involved with Hakuki army executives and elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you get involved anymore.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... well... in the not too distant future, the rest of this era will die... and then the army will withdraw from the ruins..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I thought. "I don't like that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I didn't intend to wait for Trainer of this era to die... even if I didn't intend to, it might be possible that indirectly what I do in this era will lead to Trainer's death rather than the defeat of the Demon King army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I've been involved in standing up to Rokkai in the past few days....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think so... ah... I don't like that..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it was the course of history for Traynor to die, I don't want to be involved in that course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew I had to go home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not one day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
