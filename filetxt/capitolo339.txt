<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, what's wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, I have to go back to the future. I've decided to go home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although the chief is an elf, he is likely to be familiar with many things about the world, such as writing novels in the earth world, so I think that if we discuss with Espi and Slaya, they will do something about the land.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I need you to discuss it with Slaya...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Espi... Slaya..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What, oniichan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to leave these two behind. More than a dozen years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do you communicate that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How are you going to convince me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We won't be seeing each other for more than a dozen years now....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, oniisan. Where do you think you're buying land?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah, ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't think of a word. But I don't have time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We need to move fast to reach Shisonotami.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Er... Sisonotami... the mountainous area beyond here seems to be the territory of the Kingdom of Japone, and some of the mountains are individually owned and sold... or bought there..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Japone... cross Shisonotami? No, no, oniisan. As many as you want, it's hard to get there without noticing."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, there is also the problem that the chiefs cannot get there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Once you're out of the woods and into the plains, you can't get there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are fewer than a hundred elves in the settlement, and it is highly likely that they will be found if they move to the boulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, Ralwyev, can we get there with your warp?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... elementary school students are that far away..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's nothing wrong with me, Espi, and Slaya. But then, "Well then, the elves will be abandoned", which is too bad for sleep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I go back to the future today and betray my precious sister and disciple, at least that won't be solved....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha... my goodness... I'm glad I could use the 'transporter' to Sisonottami... I have to get out of there again, but if I could get to Sisonottami, it would be the warp distance from there..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, it's nothing, oniisan. Self talk."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Traina reacted to the unclear words spoken by the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Transfer device...? The device...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Hey, Chieftain... Transfer Soach? What are you talking about? A kind of magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Oh, that's enough. It's a device. A device. As a matter of fact... there are transporters scattered all over the world with Sisonotami technology, and with them, we can move them all the way to Sisonotami at once."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, to tell you the truth, I just realized that the device is nearby. I can't use it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna seemed to care, so when I asked her instead, Sarari and the chief told me something terrible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not magic, but technology? Why would you do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know. Elementary students... the Demon King Army destroyed the magic city Sisonotami and investigated it afterwards, but have you ever heard of such a thing in that land?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, well... that's the lower part... because the Demon King Army was destroyed by the city of Sisonotami and some underground facilities... and even more so, the lower area was strictly closed..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've heard that before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Trayna couldn't get there, and only some of the Demon Kings knew about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of them is Yamidiré. The technique of sleeping in the depths...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the other one.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sorry, sorry. Forget this story. And anyway, this story doesn't make any sense."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As a matter of fact, the technology that sleeps deep inside... and I need the key to use that transporter. The key will take us all the way from a nearby transporter to the deepest part of Sisonotami... but without the key, we'll have to."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then where are the keys and what are they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... I actually dropped it somewhere... no, really... well, I didn't think I needed it anymore, so... hah, I guess I should have looked for it more now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Keys?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief said the key.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you. I don't know about that... before you met us? We found you wandering through the woods without a place to go..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? No, I actually lost the key recently. When I slipped my feet and fell into the river..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!? Did you fall in the river? I didn't hear you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I didn't want to be forced to marry at that time, while I was running away....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something happened suddenly... or was the chief not originally born in that settlement?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And how did the chief know so much about Sisonotami?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, before that, the key....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, chief. Is that... this it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took it out of my pocket.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Another person who knows about Shisonotami besides Traina and Yamidiré.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got it from Parippi....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, yeah. That's the master key, not just the entrance to the deepest part of the ruins, but the activation of the deepest device...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the time of chieftaincy was as if it had stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But a few seconds later....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh... eheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!? Master key!? No, why!? And that... oh, that's the one I dropped in the river and washed away!? Why does oniisan have it!? Oniisan picked it up!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I, no... I got it from someone I know..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief rushed over with his mouth wide open and screaming, as if his jaw had come off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I picked it up. No, this is serious. Really no lies, Hundred Par. I picked it up by accident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you really just pick up the palippi?! And this belongs to the chief?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, haha... is this a coincidence or a destiny..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the surviving Six Heights palippi who picked up the master key that the chief dropped, and he handed it to me in a future of more than a decade, and the drops crossed the time... but aside from that, one thing that bothered me was...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now... who is this guy... in the first place? Even if I subtract all my powers and abilities... it's not a normal elf."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes. Who is the chief?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
