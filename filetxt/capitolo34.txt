<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That night, for the first time since I learned 【Vier】, I went to bed without using the spell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, every night till the morning, I had been sparring and studying Forbidden spells in my dreams, but I rested on the day before the games without thinking about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on out, I followed Tre’ainar’s statement, that resting the mind is also a part of training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the habits that I have acquired do not change so easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even without using magic, if I repeatedly do image training in my head, I would soundly go to sleep as it is and it’ll be morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… How do you fare? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I woke up, but I didn’t feel like I stayed up late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, the body is light as the mind is so clear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I’m good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I got up, I stood in front of the mirror as is my habit after sleeping, and did some light shadow sparring before washing my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thus, I can better understand my physical condition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… a certain sharpness… all five senses are clear… also…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next, I calm myself and close my eyes. Revive that sensation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic holes that I pried open while enduring severe pain almost everyday for several days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Release magic from the magic holes of the entire body and keep it on the surface.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stable, smooth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… the sixth sense.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Or so it appears. For the time being, the first gateway for the breakthrough affords plenty of flexibility.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar nodded in reply and smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To bring the best condition at the time of battle… That is one of the trials in a sense, but it seems all is well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What about the heart then?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Five senses, sixth sense, all clear. Then, the mental side is next.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today is the day to show off the results of all we’ve done so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day I change myself, from being considered insufficient when compared to father so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today is an event for the Imperial Capital, and also parents and emperors to witness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For such an event, the day I continue to maintain my motivation with the goal of winning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pressure on me was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… I want to try it. I’m not my father or mother… I’m showing myself… I’ll knock everyone down and beat them all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Precisely, tis fine. You have a moderate sense of tension and the fortitude to face the challenge while enjoying it… This state of mind seems to be the best, as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this moment I think there is nothing more reassuring than Tre’ainar’s endorsement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it makes me believe so even more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well then, depart for the venue immediately and calm yourself in moderation. Also, the bandages.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Osu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis properly rolled up, is it not? ‘Magical Vantage’!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I have to do is prepare this body and the bandages.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This bandage seems to play a role of protecting others by warping the fist with it, but it certainly makes it easier to hit with when it is attached.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar called it ‘Magical Vantage’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And every time I wind this up, I think, ‘I fight with my fist’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… Good morning. But to wake up so early…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz. I had some preparations so I thought I better get to it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After changing clothes, putting the bandage in my pocket and leaving the room, I ran into Sadiz in the hallway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s unusual from Sadiz, who always wakes me up, and she seems a little surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh, were you so nervous you couldn’t sleep? Well, it’s true, if you can’t win the championship, you won’t get the knockers. Also the princesses, Rebal, and Fu seem like very strong opponents.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But soon Sadiz is teasing me with her grin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, she thinks the only reason I’m up so early in the morning is because I was nervous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, if I had been as before, I might have thought that way or have been unmotivated, saying ‘I’m going to disappoint everyone’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I am different now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, that’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m up early because I was able to sleep deeply.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I also gave Sadiz a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Little man?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” If I survive such a fierce battle and really win, I guess boobs might not be enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll ask you to allow sexual harassment, as well as boobs, for a whole day… maybe I’ll have you up the stakes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Li-Little man!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps because my reaction was so unexpected, Sadiz opens her eyes looking puzzled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, she immediately tried to regain the advantage by manipulating the situation so I show some dismay…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Oh, that’s right. Even though he’s already 15, he’s still a lonely virgin with no girlfriend. Little man can’t cross the line with a woman.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz dares to provoke me with that fiendish smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what will?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems I am quite relaxed now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, if I get to cross that line with Sadiz, I’ll win the championship for sure.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Li- wha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And Sadiz… won’t you accept me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Sadiz could do it in such a magnificent way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. It seems his masculinity has become considerably strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, I might as well have confidence in myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I say it to Sadiz, who blushed a little and started to panic again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, please watch me. in a little while, I’ll show a scene that Sadiz can be proud of.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just for Sadiz. Today, I’ll show everything to the people who look at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ha, Li-Little man! Please wait! Don’t forget your sword! Weren’t you breaking the blade in for the match?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Sword?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ufufufu, apparently Lil’ Earth seems to be nervous while also claiming a great deal of strength. I’m concerned about what I’ll see today. You won’t get tits if it’s a pity party, but I’ll comfort you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I forgot. I was still supposed to be a magic swordsman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while I had forgotten, Sadiz says, ‘Have you seen it?’ again and again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can’t help it, so I’m not making excuses here and I’ll just take the sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, maybe so. But talking to Sadiz, relaxed my nerves a little.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-Is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Sadiz…… I’m thankful… Always always.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While saying so and making it look like a mistake, I receive the sword and leave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Sadiz, who looked flabbergasted, returned to her room…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She body dived onto the bed!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooooh, Little man, so cooooool!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know that, and I headed to the arena in the Imperial City, which is also the venue where the game will be held.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this was the real beginning for me.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
