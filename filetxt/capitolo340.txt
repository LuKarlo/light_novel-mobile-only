<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... I'm surprised. I can't believe oniisan picked up my master key by accident...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh... well then, I'd better return this..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... no, no. I feel like I've lost it once, but it's not like I have it again..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan helped me a lot... this time around with the Augusta... so I'll definitely pay you back. I'm going to write the Distinguished Series, so why don't you just like what you get with this master key?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A master key that originally belonged to the chief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I'd give it back, but the chief refused with a complicated look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can read that there are a lot of deep thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, chief... who the hell are you...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nh ~?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I answered the question I had in mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That seemed to bother Trainer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the chief turned his back with his dumb face.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow, let's get to the transporter right away. No, I'm glad you didn't have to walk while hiding long distances. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what the chief tells everyone by clapping his hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Do you really have something like that that that you can move around in an instant?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, I mean, it's pretty quick to walk. Come on, move it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're not gonna answer my question?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought so....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I wasn't born in love with someone... an experiment made for testing by people in the profession..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Beyond the distant times... run away... and be free..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief murmured with his eyes as if he were looking far away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't understand the meaning of the word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I understand that you're saying something very important.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You don't know that, do you? But you can't explain it... it's hard to explain it... so now you just have to think of it as a writer teacher. And I'm not lying, and even if I knew about Sisonotami, I'm not thinking about using that technology to do anything about the world. Something in his hands... he didn't want to inherit from future generations either..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what the hell..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In other words, oniisan is also a strange person in that sense. Even though you're a normal person... you're not normal... oniisan, who are you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I'm the one who's stubborn... with all sorts of things... embarrassing the woman I like... rebelling against my parents..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahahahaha, isn't that what's so difficult in today's world of war? On the contrary, what kind of world has oniisan ever grown up in...? But against my parents and the girl I like... it's puberty."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, the chief doesn't seem willing to tell the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I know it's not normal after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I realized something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, it's been so long since I heard about it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, chief. What's your name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? If I were to say... now, everyone would call me chief..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn't hear the chief's name. It was really just now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, but... the book in the Distinguished Series... the author's name is probably... 'Takenoko'..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no! That's a pen name! No, I even thought of such a pen name myself... well, as always, call me chief."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, the chief seems to be embarrassed... or, if so, I wonder why he named me that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, but if you say that, I'm also oniisan's name - ah, everybody! There! That big rock!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Is this it? Chieftain!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the chief tried to ask me my name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, well, if you think about it, I don't feel comfortable naming Espi and Slaya either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why we only have fake names like Lagerman and Tapir Bael.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it appears we arrived at our destination before being asked that name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it only looks like a huge boulder in the woods....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is where Cissonotami's technology comes in?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a big rock, oniichan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But is it really like this? Oniisan, what do you think?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even elementary school students can't feel any magic... is this really the case, my lord?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, you...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It looks like nothing but a big rock. It was very unlikely that this would be related to such a ridiculous technology on the boulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what everyone seems to be like, including Trainer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the chief stood in front of the big rock.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, take a look. Oniisan, give this big rock a master key."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, ah, ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As they say, I'll take out the master key and crush it on the rocks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Master Key Confirmation Shimmer]

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!?? "" "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The big rock spoke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The rock talked!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, or is someone inside...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, Nh, who the hell are you...?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, everyone on the spot jumped out into the big rock where the words came out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and the Espi took it upon themselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... the child... the voice of now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wasn't that the same voice as that clock?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Watch?...... ah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally realized it too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Items that seem to be responsible for our arrival in this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, what do you mean...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey oniichan. That's probably the watch we talked about before, right? Juden, please."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The clock speaks? What are you talking about, Espi? Oniisan, what's wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took the watch out of my pocket.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, unlike the rocks, my watch is not the same as Un or Sun.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?... how about yeeeeeeee!? Oh, oniisan! Hey, huh? Oniisan, that's...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?! What's up, chief? Hey, do you know this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I don't know anything... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... that's what I'm talking about..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the chief looked at the watch and saw the master key, he raised his voice of consternation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you know anything about this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the chief nodded with a loud voice, gradually convincing somewhere, saying "Ah ~".
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, what's wrong with you? Hey, this rock talks, hey, you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the other elves, we have no idea what that means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the chief didn't answer that question, he just stared straight at me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oniisan. Incidentally, oniisan" is "... the future? Past? Which?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That question struck me and Trainer like never before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... look... the future..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, then, you're not wearing it. I'm the past."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This needs to be arranged in a way that doesn't interfere with oniisan a lot... but for now, we need to move first."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bad. My heart is pounding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief is a bit more than just an ordinary elf... there's something more and more extraordinary about secrets...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Oishi spoke again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what's going on or what's going on anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the chief raised his hands towards the big rock like calm.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "For now... cohon..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I coughed slightly and raised my hands....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now, doors, follow my voice and open the closed old doors! Eh..." Open Sesame "!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the big rock moved backwards on its own, and a staircase appeared beneath it leading to a dark basement.
