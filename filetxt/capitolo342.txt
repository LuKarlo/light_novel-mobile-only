<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If there is a Demon King army on the ground, hurry back to the basement. That was the arrangement, but it was not necessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is... Shisonotami"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Transported from the floor to the ground, the scenery before you is definitely a different place from the forest of the elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was confused by the landscape that was spreading before my eyes, as I realized that we had really warped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Something... ruins and ruins..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the magical city of Sisonotami, famous for its history...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there are no more houses or buildings, let alone people living there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was used as one of the bases of the Demon King's army, but now it's turned into a barren shell with scattered tents and firewood, and it looks like nothing but wasteland.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... this is what happened in the city above the lab..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's nobody here... oniichan..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sisonotami... I didn't know anything about the demon army being destroyed and turned into a base... but this is it..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is my first time here as a junior student....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The site of the Demon King Army faction... apart from that, there's a bit of rubble and nothing left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if they told me there was a lab in the basement of this place, they wouldn't know for sure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina seems to be ridiculing herself. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is it....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a moment later that this was the place where Thaddeus was born, but I thought I had no choice but to think deeply about it and immediately shake it off my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But what do you mean? There must have been a Gouda army here... nobody here, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? Gouda was there... gouda... uuu ~..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While looking around, Ralwyev questioned, and Gouda and her related espi had a nasty expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Espi failed Gouda's assassination and met me in retribution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A while ago... the Goudas and the Allies were at war... and Gouda was attacked by the brave Hiro."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then, with Gouda's death, the remnants of the Gouda army quickly retreated... Tomorrow, the Allies will arrive here and recapture Sisonotami. That's why today is the only way for everyone to move."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking around, I told everyone about the history Traina taught me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, everyone was surprised at me for suddenly telling them that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Stupid, Gouda-san is immortal among the six hegemons. I can't believe he's going to die! What the hell is going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really!? Oniichan, Gouda is dead!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oniisan! They say Sarari, but Gouda is one of the six great demon generals, just like Noja and Hakuki! A legendary adult, dead!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, naturally, that's the reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's true. Brave Hiro's irrational superpower? And it looks like they erased it without leaving a piece of meat behind."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, I am a textbook person, but for everyone living in this era, Rokkai is so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait, wait... how do you know that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, oniichan, when did you find out?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From Ralvives' point of view, this is a natural question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralph and I have been together for a few days, even before the Espi, and I wonder when I got that information.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief remained silent without saying anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I'll think about it. So far, I've tried to fake a lot of reason, but I've come this far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me and Trayna, it's the goal of our journey in this era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that's the case, there's only one place left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And all the truth.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm!? Kid, wait a minute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I tried to tell the truth, Traina stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... is anybody there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was rough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I aggressively activated the radar, and, as Traina said, I picked up signs of someone other than us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The number is one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "People!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Who is it... the Demon King Army?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, over there...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really, one of them... the Allies?... no, that's it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someone is walking alone from the rubble a little further away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I thought I was really dying..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The person who speaks to himself... is not human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Demons!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Auga? No, no. It's a giant, but it's not an auger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It stretches a giant horn like a beetle from its forehead, and its flesh is covered in a black-skinned epidermis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And on the chest of that giant, a lump like a red magma is beating like it's about to explode.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... bah... I wonder... stupid... what the hell is this..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trainer is so upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you know him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell... hmm? No, that's...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But the magic inside my body is about to explode... this... will I die next time, too...? But I can't just die... with one big explosion to wipe those bastards out... ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meet the mysterious demon clan... ah... that? That face.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? Eh... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... ah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I saw him, the moment I saw him, the Espi pulled out of his hips and became scared, Ralviv was just stunned....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That face... no way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, wow... oniisan... well, what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The face alone seemed to have known Slaya and the chief, which meant there was so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know that too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've seen it in textbooks!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This guy, I'm surprised. My soul mates are retreating, too... hey, did you get in first to see how things are going?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not what surprises me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even more than our reaction....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bye... I wonder... what do you mean? This is... this is... this is... what is this!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The upset Trainer roughed up his voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... Seven brave kids... who are you guys...? The Allies and the elves... and even the hunter's fucking kid... I don't know... but you won't tell me my name when we meet! Listen to me if you know! And applaud!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, this kind of thing.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Temee, listen carefully to your brains, which are smaller than one piece of shit from me!! This is my final live!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This... this... this... this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh ~ Sa ~ Ma ~ Gouda ~, big ~ General ~ ~!!!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Trayna and I will be the last to tell you the truth of history that the world doesn't know, and that the world will never tell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
