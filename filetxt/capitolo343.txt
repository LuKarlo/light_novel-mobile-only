<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Loud enough to make you think that the air is going to shake and destroy your ears. The song?　Isn't that an attack?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not the point now, this is the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We have to get our story straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ～Once upon a time, there was a legendary monster called the Demon Giant God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That huge body bigger than a mountain. One step and the earth would shake, one swing of the fist and the earth would crack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the giant god was destroyed by a holy sword wielded by a brave man of light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Roughly, it must have looked something like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the history we read about in picture books and textbooks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda died because he was defeated by his father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Traina is aware of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he survived under his father's sword, he would still be doomed to die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, is it possible that my father and Gowda will be fighting again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh~~...... what a blur, clap for my beautiful voice!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「「「「?!!!? 」」」」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm just being funny right now!　But it's also a personality!　That's right personality!　It rocks!　Whoa, whoa, whoa, long live Daima-sama!　Hilo and humans must die!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it's completely fucked up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Should I run for it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gouda the Great!　I am Larwife, a member of the Amazons of the Army of Noja!　I heard that ...... was engaged with its ...... brave men and women.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah An?　That's right!　I had a run-in with that asshole, and he blew me to pieces with his joke of a force!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, shattered. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But I have 'super demon recovery'!　In other words, no matter how much your body falls apart, as long as you're alive for a few seconds ...... no, that's already exploded beyond acceptable limits, but ...... ahhhhh, I don't care about the details!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A gust of wind generated by a single angry voice is likely to blow you away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, "Super Demon Recovery"?　Oh, that's ...... for sure
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, child. The same constitution as Kakrétaire's ostrich. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I believe I heard something like that when I fought Mr. Macho in a cakrétaire competition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --The structure of the human body ...... When the physical body is stressed by such things as strength training, it is temporarily diminished due to muscle fiber damage and fatigue, but with proper rest, the rebound from the recovery can be greater than before. It leads to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy in ...... it is called super recovery. But there are some people with a unique constitution ...... who can deliberately control and activate every cell in the body without needing to rest, regenerate and restore the body and bones at super speed, and even gain more strength than before. And it's not just about training. If you break a bone, it will regenerate into a stronger and more durable bone than before, and if it is damaged in battle, it will recover more physically strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does this mean that Gouda managed to survive his father's attack with his ability?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And more gutted and stronger?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to waste time explaining it to you, asshole!　Besides, don't listen to my explanations and stories!　Listen to the song!　From ancient times to the present day, rock and roll!　Feel it, Imagine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even as you get stronger, the balance of physical, mental and magical power is already messed up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like you're in a runaway state, beyond your recovery tolerance. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oooooohhhhhh, the last decay fireworks!　But first, you'll have to let me turn you into a gritty mess!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, not good!　Everyone, spread out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda pounced on me, screaming and drooling with his eyes no longer coming, floating veins all over his body like he was on the verge of bursting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 'Ungoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　The Beatles Impact Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh ！！！！
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He jumped in with a sharp, huge horn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast!　But too straightforward to avoid .........
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「「「「?!!!? 」」」」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We each fly backwards on the spot to get some distance between us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the antlers of the rushing Gouda hit the ground, creating a huge hole in the earth with a powerful explosion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "e ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is ......?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a destructive force!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's huge, and the bottom is too deep.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you get hit in front of that thing, you can go to ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gahahahahahaha, no matter where you run to!　We're going to get some clueless Union idiots here soon enough anyway!　I'll set off a huge fireworks display when I'm old enough to know better!　Gahhaha, I don't know what's going to happen: ...... I'm so hot I can't believe I'm about to burst!　What's more, it's going to be a huge explosion, not just for this city, but for a huge area!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You've got to be kidding me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja, Hakki, and then Gowda!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, not only do we fight ...... explode,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Big brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Your brother ...... should stay away from this place. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dear Mr. Gouda: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, they say it's going to explode, so maybe we should run away for now, don't you think?　An underground facility would be able to withstand an explosion. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sheikh says it's a smoothie, but is it the hardest thing to do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what happens if we leave this guy like this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As long as the basement can withstand the explosion of this thing, it's OK?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, to begin with, the Confederates are ...... This Sisonotami ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ...... The only flow in history is that the Sisonotami was recaptured by humans after the retreat of the ...... Gouda Army. There is no record of the disappearance of the Sissonotami site due to a massive explosion or any damage to the Allied forces ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 !"?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that point, Trena told me again the history to my confusion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, this situation was unexpected even for Traina: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, hey, you don't think ...... history has changed, do you ......?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't you think that's because of all the things I've done in this world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, ...... would not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "History hasn't changed ...... and the fact that you existed behind the scenes of history is also the truth of history ...... which means that maybe this is also the right history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, but Gouda is alive!　No, ...... don't tell me that ...... is not going to die like this, and in the future you're going to survive pretending to be dead like Palipino. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trena did not even know that Paripi was alive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as well as that about Gouda: ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, this guy isn't that adept ...... and above all, as he says, his body ...... exceeds the allowable range of super demon recovery, and the vast amount of magic and circuitry in his body gets messed up, goes out of control, and he can't even get to the bottom of it. Any minute now, he will explode ...... and he will die from it. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, no, but if that's how ...... the explosion happens, how about ...... my dad and the confederates ...... shishonotami?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the historical sequence of events is correct that Gouda will die in a massive explosion, then the explosion will kill my fathers and the allied forces?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it wasn't damaged, then ...... even the explosion was managed by ...... 'someone' must have done something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somebody managed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someone in this case is ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh ...... me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, the fact that I didn't do any damage to the dads at the hands of the living Gouda means that I stopped the explosion behind the scenes of history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You've got to be kidding me, old man!　Paripi is alive, Gouda is like this, Hakki is like that, Yamidire is like that, and Noja and "Lyphant" are like that ......, and the seven heroes haven't defeated a single one of the Six Champions!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, brother, what's going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The truth of the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And even the last blow of the six-header is protected from me by ...... my father ...... is ...... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "?　Children, for now, don't think about anything else, but focus on what's in front of you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh?　Well, wait a minute, here ...... Here ......, I'm going to do something that means history is going to happen here .......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I suddenly wondered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, wait. ...... No, wait, as Trina is in a terrible hurry to "not think". Wait?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happens if I don't do anything extra and let Gowda blow up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child!　Look forward!　Children!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dad dead?　No, even if he had not died, he would have done enormous damage to the Allied forces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What would have happened to the war then?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How was the battlefield of the war between the United Humanity and the Demon King's Army changed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Didn't the Demon King's army have an overwhelming advantage?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, wait. If you go back to ...... in the first place, what would have happened if I hadn't helped Espy in his failed assassination attempt on Gouda?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't want to think about it, but Espy would have been dead. That means that one of the seven brave men would have crumbled. It would have been a huge loss of strength for humanity, and morale would have been lowered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what about Noja?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What about Aonie and her friends?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child!　Don't think nonsense!　Focus!　Look ahead!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, what are you doing?　I'm spaced out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I came to this era, I tried not to do anything too superfluous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I didn't even try to fight the Demon King's army willingly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as it turns out, that was not possible at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I helped Espy. As a result, the Demon King's army lost the chance to defeat one of the Seven Heroes and reduce its strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fought Noja. As a result, Genkern and the captured men were freed. Many of those men were also Allied soldiers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Aonie?　The hero of the Demon King's army with the title "Kittelez something". He was undoubtedly a major force in the Demon King's army. But he died to protect me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not going to be the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espy was dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Noja was not retreating, but was damaging the Allied forces and humanity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aonie was alive and well and a threat to humanity as a soldier in the Demon King's army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this Gouda?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child!　Don't think about it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What would have happened if I hadn't done something about this Gouda explosion, too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wasn't the war overwhelmingly in favor of the Demon King's army?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I came to this time, because I went the extra mile ...... I'm ...... all me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Child!　Can you hear me!　Children!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the war had progressed in the Demon King's army's overwhelming advantage, ...... what would have happened if I hadn't gone off on a tangent?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn you ......, you big idiot. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that moment, my mind and heart were reminded of all the things that had happened since that day I met Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strict, scary, but funny, fun, strong, dependable, respectful, and grateful to have met ...... grateful to have met her... ... thanks only to ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't thank you enough: ...... I've just come up with a hell of a theory. No, it's not a hypothesis anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I hadn't done anything else, ...... the demon king's army wouldn't have been defeated by humanity and ...... Traina wouldn't have died.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't get cocky: ...... the big idiot. ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "...... Trina ...... me ......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What did I say to you, who were hesitating whether to save the Slayer because of the impact on the ...... history of the war against Noja?
