<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child reached the theory. "If I ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I certainly didn't think much about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child looks back on when he helped Espi in the woods, but the rest first thought about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Childhood Hiro was saved by the child. It all started there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the child hadn't helped Hiero back then... even if he had been lucky, he would never have had a yearning for justice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From that moment everything started, and it was during the skirmish with Kojiro that I was convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During that skirmish, the child triggered a breakthrough. Kojiro felt it. The child would simply not have known, but it was a critical point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what's the matter?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I lost the rest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rest is dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happens now that you know that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I pushed your back so many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kids. I told you... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yu said to the child who was hesitant to save Slaya, worried about the impact on history in the battle against Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Child... even if this world is in the past... now is the time for you and the rest. Then at this moment, you'll forget everything about the flow of time. Just face the reason before you... you have to fight. Didn't I tell you in the woods where I met the Espi of our time? I thought it was history... and you had to do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --With that, no matter how much influence the Demon King army of this era has been influenced by you... don't look back on the rest. I'm not as girly as you think I am.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Trainer.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I don't want to be backed by the Great Demon King. Listen to your master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no lie in it. That's why I told the children to fight without worrying about the rest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... back then... up until now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nu?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But... not this time... I'm not sure... what I'm going to do here is for you... no matter what you think"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Exactly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda's death was undoubtedly a great countersmoke for mankind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Killing the corner of the legendary Rokkai greatly boosted the morale of mankind and, on the contrary, shocked and darkened the demonic realm and the King's army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the children had done nothing, the Demon King army would not have been defeated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There would have been no other death.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, kid... then... the rest couldn't have met you, could they?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's all connected. Now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugoraaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you were responsible for the death of Yu, it was not enough to train you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan, I have to do it! Fluffy world!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, collaborate! Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, what do you mean... Gouda-sensei is rampaging..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Holy shit... there are no animals, no insects, no birds nearby, and I'm the least useful..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just a cynical journey, and you don't have to feel responsible for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugolaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll tell you again and again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You should feel free to take responsibility.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Against Aony... Against Gouda...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Your gouda is getting bigger and bigger...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And the body is even stronger!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is the power of Gouda-sama... not only the super magic recovery, but also the immensity of physical manipulation..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, if you do that in such a state, the explosion will go faster..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll tell you again and again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll tell you again and again. Don't fall in love with yourself, child. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Trainer..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though one of you is still half a man, how could you threaten the life of the mightiest remaining Almighty?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You've grown stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Enough to confront the tip of the Rokkai.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If the Demon King army was unaware of such existence, it would be a threat if it had been implicated behind the world and history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the aftermath of the time, such a thing... but...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don't seem to understand, so I'll ask you again. Who's the rest?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon King... Traina..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. The Great Demon King Traina wouldn't have looked after it... but now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A fool. The rest... is your teacher. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And if you are the remaining disciple, then you will meet the expectations of your mentor... and you will be the extra proud!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I'm sorry... Gouda... just like Aony...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But, child... if you still feel backwardness... then listen to one more wish."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Please? You?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't run away from the end of Gouda."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda, you were so proud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am truly sorry that such a person who was raised by others will make mistakes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, at least....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If Gouda's death from an explosion is inevitable, he won't die alone without meaning... at least after letting it all out..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of dying of a crazy explosion, I fought the last and most outrageous man, and let him cum without regret.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Respond to the end of Gouda."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Respond....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's all I can ask of you... that's all I can ask of you"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ohh... uhhhhh! Hold on!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shake off the flowing tears and have good eyes, child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that's fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi! Slaya! Ralph! Everybody, stay back! I'll do it alone!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" What!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if it responds, is it fair and one-on-one?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, what are you talking about!? These guys are totally different from the augers back then!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, it will take us all here, and I think it's best to see when to leave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Do you know what you're saying?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan's alone is not realistic....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that's a natural reaction. This is what happens when a runaway Gouda fights alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still, don't do it, never!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oni-chan... why..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, I told you to stick to one-on-one and don't put your hands in the air... no, kid... I told you to face the end of Gouda, but I didn't tell you to fight one-on-one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know what to do. My master is not convinced by the battle and the decision to beat one person in this final match... with a large number of people."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?... ah... is that so?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, that's right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --The brave ones are so cowardly, they can't read the air! It's no exaggeration that they don't know the word "fair"! Ahhhhhhhh, damn it!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day I first met you, Yu told you about Hyiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Cowardly extremes! All right? This is the final showdown... they got into the Great Demon King's Palace... and seven warriors headed by Hyiro arrived at the bottom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Seven... ah... seven brave men of mankind...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That's right! But normally, when you get there, you'll be riding around with the fate of the world of the Great Demon King and the mightiest brave? But they... attacked them all together! Including your mother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was spilling a feminine stupidity without being recognized for defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Maybe! Besides, if you still think that you've been left behind, Hiro's guy... when you say things like, "Give us all the power to think of all mankind in one place", all mankind sends power to Hiro and knocks down a huge sword that brings that power together! Cowardly or not!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you going to think of the rest of those words, child, and reward not only Gouda, but also the rest?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah? Alone? Goraaaa, Temee, did you say you'd do it alone?! I'm crazy, but I know what this is all about!? You're licking me!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think I'm going to lick it. But there's something going on here. Gouda the Magus, the corner of the Rokkai! I'll catch you in the end!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh? The accessories don't suddenly pop out with big things! Not to mention the seven braves and the hunter's fucking kids, who's Temee in the first place!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda asks such a child who knows nothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who are you? and
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then the child goes to Gouda... no, it's not just Gouda...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Who am I? Then I'll tell you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps the words mean "this is the last battle of our time."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why Espi and Slaya, which are also bonds spinned in this era, are here....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Earth Lagan!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A man who has crossed the time to catch the end of Theme!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time in this world, the children shouted their names untrue unto the inhabitants of this age.
</div>
