<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh?... earth? Is that your brother's name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You didn't even know the Espi!? No, it's true that we've always called you oniisan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not Lagerman... Earth Lagan... huh? Ragan? Ragan is exactly like Hiro... is he of the same lineage as Hiro!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... heh ~..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this moment, I will give everything I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legendary Rokkaha. It was my father's rival.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've had fists with Yamidiré, Palippi, Noja, and Hakuki.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you look back, I didn't fight alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For Yamidiré and Noja, there are two people with Traina's advice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only Trayna, but Sadis, Macho, and Fiancei were there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't say I fought against the postcard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, this is the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here we go, Gouda!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said I'd fight alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not just that we don't need Espi, Slaya, Ralwyev, or the sheikh's backup.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't get Traina's advice here either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, you give it all up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seriously, I'll fight alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the first match between me and Rokkai.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ragan? Ah... what a nasty name! Crush him and drop his fist!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda got bigger. Plus, it's like Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As you look at it, you feel incredible power from the muscles that swell up into the bread.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you add not only arm strength but also weight, Aka and Macho will be no match for each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Breakthrough!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uluaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's too big. I can see the initial motion in full.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you hit me, I won't be spared... I'm used to fighting like that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical footwork!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huge feet tread on the earth, and big fists break it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, my trunk and footwork do not shake with a little shaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the shattered fragments of the earth and the rising soot and smoke, I avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Sonic Flicker!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Oops!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shock waves from blind spots are thrown at Gouda's eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda blinked aggressively and seemed to have prevented an attack on the eyeballs, but the blood vessels floating on her forehead were clearly irritating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ndagaaaaaahhhhh, if I thought you were a jerk, now it's a jerk!? You're bluffing to say you'll take it!? Still a man!? Kinta, are you with me?!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh, I'm getting ready now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ready!? Bullshit, guys don't need to be ready! It's a man, a man, a man, a man!! Uhhhhh, I'm a man among men!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That figure and endurance can't do lethal damage with just a left punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is all a fabric stone for a big shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Move your legs and make a rhythm on the left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The irritated gouda punches and feet even more porous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Monotonic, cluttered and easy to read.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh! Fungaaah! Nudriaaaaaaa!!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, it's a monster that's completely out of control anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's so violent that you can't get your hands on it, it's more vivid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As huge as Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But power and destructive power are above Noja.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it's not as complicated or as fast as Noja's tail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you focus and see a few attacks, you'll get used to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Get lost!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda's downhill left hits the ground. But I ran it and avoided it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Gouda tries to pull back an underdeveloped punch....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Devil Spiral Earth Phantom Sonic Impact!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "-------!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Countershock wave aimed at the moment the opponent pulls back the arm they attacked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of a simple blind spot in the field of view, the shock wave was aimed at the blind spot of the other person's consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A massive blow from the whirling Great Demon Spiral struck Gouda's temple directly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahn...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like the shock waves of the Great Demon Spiral... they don't seem to penetrate or be blown away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in an unexpected blow, a giant gouda fell down and fell on one knee in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... the deck is so close to my face... now I can smash it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The bigger and taller Gouda's face jumps, the closer it reaches.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Suhah... breakthrough. And...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, wet!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hold your breath with Magic Breath, then Break Through again with the Magic Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jump, jump on the knee of a gouda with one knee on it and step on it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Spiral Earth Breakooooo!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of shock waves, I put a big demon helix directly on his big face...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Beatles Head!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuhh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda aggressively intercepted me with a headband just around the neck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of avoiding it, I'd rather jump in....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "When, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hard, heavy! Strong!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My body was blown away lightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The big demon helix that was struck repeatedly on the ground, rolled, and even attacked was shattered, causing severe pain and numbness in the right arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blunt pain in your body's bruises.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stay, eh? I didn't think you'd get hit back like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't believe... there's someone jumping into the Great Demon Spiral..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, it's a bug, and it can't be that easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, it was convincing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't stand it anymore! Gouda, buzz!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, we too..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't give me your hand, Espi! Slaya!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I can't withdraw the foreword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, Slaya... this is a matter of course... if you're fighting one of the Six Heights... it's within your expectations. So don't make a scene... I've been bounced back, but I haven't lost yet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan... but, hey! I can't do it alone!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't worry. This is my only role given to me. It's not that I can't do it, it's what I have to do."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stand up. It's okay. Still working. There's no stamina left. Pain can be overcome with energy and guts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh! I can still do it, Gouda!! There's still plenty of stuff left!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shouted that I could still fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, Gouda, who has spoken to me, looks at me like she's calmed down somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... why did you use that technique? Temee, seriously... what is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Big demon helix? Breakthrough?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you run wild and go mad, you still have to worry about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The truth... I still can't tell you in this state...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Earth Lagan. Now, that's it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah? Thh, Ragan... ahhhh ~ That's what he said... ahhh ~... is Temee the brother of that fucking brave... Hyiro? Relatives?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is my son. But you can't just put me together like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I have a blood connection with the brave Hyiro, but it doesn't matter! Don't look at me like Hiro the Brave!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm me! The last to see Temeye is not related to the brave, not to the Allies, but just a man named Earth Ragan! Look at me until the end!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Son of a brave man. Look at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't have a title, just look at me as a man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told Six Heights Gouda about the thoughts I had on the people around me for a long time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Gouda....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see.... I don't really know... but I still know... Temee, you're such a big... Han!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think it's already a broken mind and body, but Gouda forced me to smile and tell me that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
