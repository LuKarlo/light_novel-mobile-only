<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina won't fight this time. But they'll be watching us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he asked me to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said I was the only one who could do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what this euphoria is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than when Traina pushed me back in that Empire match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know if I can lose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, huh... ahh... I'm gonna mess it up... grounded?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda breathes roughly when she calls me by my name. But you seem to be feeling more calm than before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that calm is also the calm before the storm... the calm before the big explosion, and the tingling and chilly feeling of compression doesn't change.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You can crush me... and I'll lose you... if you want."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, Nudorahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda roars again. However, it's not just roaring and flying, it's just roaring on the spot and putting strength into your whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell are you doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought so, a change occurred to Gouda's whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is that, Gouda's body....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Based on Gouda's giant body? No... like it's shrinking..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gouda, what are you going to do? Unlocking the Huge....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... that's not... disarming... it feels like you're forcibly squeezing the expanding flesh smaller..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda is about to recover from the giant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it seems to be forcibly squeezing the muscles, as the chief said, rather than simply releasing the giant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ka, hah... ngu, gunununu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda is trying to restore herself as if someone wearing large clothes were suddenly wearing clothes of different sizes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Temee, what are you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, hee... magic and muscle manipulation... well, that's it... by doing this... I can't lose sight of it... because I squeezed it, it's lighter... and faster..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, since I forced you to do it... this stimulus... has reduced the time to explosion all at once... but it doesn't matter if you kill me instantly! That means you won't let Temee escape anymore!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The size has been restored. However, the muscles were forced to contract, making them even more dense, and they're kind of getting excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I realize that I've seen Gouda somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was a cocktail....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!? That's right, Macho's... pump-up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Control of muscle and blood flow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, Macho increased his power and speed remarkably.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Same as that? No, more than that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, when Gouda kicks the earth...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Die, Gorah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast! Avoid... impossible, out of orbit...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Parry!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't have time to step aside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We have to change the trajectory of Gouda's punch, which flies in a straight line. No, we can't. Perfectly... played...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Demon Slip-away!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I twist my neck and parry against Gouda's punch, which plays my paring without a thing, and flies with my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh, nnh, Nanda Sora!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a punch. The fist pressure fills up the debris in the distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, the destructive power has gone up to incremental speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let's do it again!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda is now on the left hook. And the next moment, only Gouda's left arm swelled up a lot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this a form of muscle manipulation? Strengthen muscles where needed? Can't you do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's a simple left hook that just swings your arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first shot surprised me at a faster pace than I imagined, but I could calmly look at Gouda's muscle movements, gaze, elbows, fists, and joints before reading it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crouch down on the spot to avoid the left hook.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, a chance. This is the pocket of Gouda, looking up at his empty jaw.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Big Devil Frog Punch!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From a crouched state, jump like a frog and hit the upper....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, huh, huh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah ~......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does the body have the same stiffness when it's down in size? No, it's more dense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of lifting my neck, my fist hurts the other way around, even though it's an uppercut with perfect timing and angle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Do something itchy..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shock wave of fury is coming. Ah, I can't leave this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Escape"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ugh, your tympanic membrane is about to tear. I wonder how powerful the shock wave is just by screaming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhhhh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I read it earlier. [M] I managed to get out of range.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chih, don't run away again... yeahh! Han, why don't you stop and meet?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda is still chasing. Drop your hips and look like an animal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, Gouda swollen his legs into the bread and flew straight like a shell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This explosive speed... if it's a linear move, it's faster than me in a breakthrough state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the feint... no, I don't care about the feint. He's just flying straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Demon Swim!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Swim sideways in a low position with your arms covered against the gouda flying from the front.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ko, Konnoo... hah, hah... Urochiro, uuhhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda stopped suddenly against me as if she was slipping through, and then she turned around and tried to hit me straight on the right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's monotonous. It fits this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Demon Cross Counter!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cross counter on the right. Light Cross.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Th, uhh... nh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuu... the kid..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, no... the right arm that hurt when the Great Devil's helix was crushed... now my fist bones are broken, my elbows are broken... and my shoulders too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know, I... I don't do much damage to the opponent, and I'm taking more damage... but you know what!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The Great Devil Heart Break Shot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ubu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even my cross counter won't shake. I'll pound my left fist into Gouda's heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without damage, Gouda's body is stiff for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the magic accumulated to the left that was pulled back....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, the Great Devil Spiral Earth Breakooo!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhhhhhhhhh!???
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tap the Great Demon Spiral into the empty Gouda's abdomen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's completely in. There is also a touch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Drill a hole!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shredded my abs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can feel it. Certainly a tough, too hard muscle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if it's hard, it's better than Rosala the Dragon King of the Underworld.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rosala didn't have any teeth in the Great Demon Spiral, but Gouda's body barely had teeth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once the tip is slightly in your abs, all you have to do is...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't lick me, motherfucker!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shit, it's too much!? Take the distance... slow. I concentrated too much on the Great Demon Spiral and my legs stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gotcha! Aah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gh, ahh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While taking my Great Demon Spiral into my belly, Gouda rather forcefully advanced from herself, forcing me to crush the Great Demon Spiral with my abs, widening my arms and turning it around my back to hold it tight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, you can't escape this restraint!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, you can squeeze it like this... but I'll smash it from the sky!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda lifts me overhead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, no. Are you going to lift it and hit it like this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is certainly the same as Macho's Power Bomb.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this guy does that, I'm more of a... power bomb than a brain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ruthlessly pinched Gouda's head with both feet, and kept flying diagonally back....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Coke Screw Head Scissors Suck!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ngoh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using recoil, Gouda's head was hit on the ground by corners instead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow!? Oh, oniichan! Wow! It's so fast, I have no idea, but it's amazing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "S, wow... wow! Amazing, oniisan! I can't believe I hit the counter instead of dodging all those Gouda attacks! That was awesome! Cool!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What a gorgeous but too fast offensive defense... I can't catch up... these two..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, whoa, that's an old document... Frankensteiner!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost died, but it was the same as then, so I saved my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the technique that I showed you in the fight against Macho on the Cacretail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though Trayna taught me, I thought I'd never use such a fancy trick again, except in that fight with Macho.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Goddamn it, you're so brave, you're just a little craftsman... grough! But... it feels so good... even though your consciousness is about to fly again and again due to your physical runaway... you'll wake me up every time... ahhhhhh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, the Great Demon Spiral is crushing my belly, and my brain is beaten... and I'm going to get hurt and get up..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even this technique could be pulled out instantly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't have Traina's advice this time. But all of Traina's teachings are stained with me now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
