 "Hee, hee, Earthu... why don't you play with me, woohoo?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I struck pretty hard from the start of the fight.

 Great Devil Spiral Earth Break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But instead of being fatally wounded, Gouda shouts out loudly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don't know what the damage is, but I wonder if the effects of the pump up are quite resounding or if my breath gets rough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, it's the same twice or three times since I used the technique I thought I'd never use again. If you like it, why don't we do more?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's where I suck myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic can be restored by magic breathing. She also has health.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But your right arm is broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, it doesn't mean I'm going to stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What matters is what you can do in your current state and what you should do next.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Keh, you're doing great like a craftsman bucca!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Gouda is also tired and comes back to me at high speed, even if her body is about to break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I'll have to be reckless too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of running around until Gouda blows herself up, she only moves around to defeat it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew... magical radar from the zone!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Radar is also activated in the zone with Breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This increases the movement and pre-fetch of the opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This way.....

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Split Step"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nugu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shook Gouda's stiff arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Avoid simple hooks, upper and straight. But we don't take the distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I only waited in the eye of the typhoon while keeping a distance between Gouda.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, the only trick I can beat in Gouda is the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even if you hit an idiot honestly, you'll be avoided or shattered with Gouda's body and technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to take it to a state where it doesn't give me the space to fight back or apply force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Demon Carioca Step! Daemon Spin! Great Demon Crossover Step! Great Devil Slip Away!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To do that, you have to tap it in the counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Crush it to pieces!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is it! We can do it at this time!

 "The Great Demon Spiral Earth Spiral..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You know what, ahhhhhhh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I tried to hit the counter at an inevitable time against the gouda that stepped in, the gouda who was not willing to avoid it in the first place rushed in, scraped his body with the Great Demon Spiral... but still rushed in without fear, crushing the Great Demon Spiral again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You think I'm shaking with half the pain now! Don't lick me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. The opponent is Rokuha.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know if it's about to explode, but now that my body has been scraped off a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My mind is completely out of pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead, I have to do so much....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, whoa, Jolt the Great Demon!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, if the Great Demon Spiral of the left arm is destroyed, I'll hit you on the right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't even hit a decent punch because it's broken, and just bending and stretching my elbows causes me a lot of pain... it's nothing compared to life!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eat your teeth for a while....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hahahahahahaha, you have good guts! But... poor and weak!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was forced to shake my broken right arm once more. Load your teeth with your full weight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Gouda hit her left fist to match the fist, and my jolt was easily bounced back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My right arm is dead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, my upper body was completely turned upside down with the intention of poking into the other party's gap, and my posture collapsed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ma, mazu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your upper body is upside down, you're out of balance, and you can't take steps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't move my hands either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's over! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, Gouda waved her right fist, and only her arm became huge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does this guy put this blow in his right arm and kill me? Extinguished? I can't even disappear anymore... counter with a headbat? I can't, it's not that dimension!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the Great Demon Spiral... but not with both arms in this position...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I thought about the mess and did it right at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care if I can, because I'm gonna die if I don't.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Big demon helix headbutt!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon Spiral is a technique that focuses all magic on your arm from a Breakthrough state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the right arm, sometimes on the left arm. Sometimes on both arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you think about it carefully, it's just concentrating on your arms, not just your arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh... oh! Focus on the magic part... now you can do it not only in your arms, but elsewhere!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using all the magic in my head and recoil from behind, I made a big demon helix on my forehead and jumped in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, uh-oh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My counterhead bat has been under Aka's fist and Aony's knee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now it's a headbat to throw your whole body out with the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is Gouda's swollen fist....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nuh, nugaa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I played it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Gouda rolled back. The Great Demon Helix Headbat, which multiplied its power by several times at the counter, retracted Gouda.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hah, hah, hah... here it is!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm not losing! Me too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was aggressive, but it wasn't just the arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's on my head. No, this sensation... if necessary, can be enhanced by instantly focusing magic on your legs and parts of your body!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put magic into both my feet. You can step on the earth more vigorously than ever before and jump out more momentum.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And instantly, the magic jumps into your head in the same way as before, creating a big demon helix.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Great Devil Spiral Earth Diving Head Bat Break!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gouda kicked the earth with both feet, causing a rebound of her upper body just like me, and returned the headbutt with a horned head to my Devil's helix headbutt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That headbat that broke my Great Demon Spiral... no, now I'm more powerful than before!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 "Nh, this... uhhhhhhhhh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm already thinking about concentrating or previewing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, what we know is that the headbutt bumps right now are mutually reinforcing? No, I bounced back faster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Gouda is also slightly retreating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, Gouda and I were played, but we didn't fall apart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then do it again.
