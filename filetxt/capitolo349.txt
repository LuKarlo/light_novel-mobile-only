<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sun rises higher than the sky and ends up scattered in magnitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time as I baked the last one into my eyes, my chest was tightened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Did I... respond to him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don't have to ask me that now, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina answered my murmuring as I fell from the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well done, boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You won by yourself without any extra help... unlike the Hieros who always fought with the help of their allies... you did well. And I was able to see Gouda's majestic final appearance without fear of a few lives left...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, the most crazy bastard named Gouda is still engraved in the heart of me and Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was able to see and respond to the end of him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You were more proud of me than winning the Rokkai.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Traina... then... and then..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mmm
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the battle is over, and my job is over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fluffy oniichan duck!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you hear Gouda scream to catch me, or couldn't wait? The Espi flew towards me as it fell, caught me with the power of flotation, and stuck to me in the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha, Espi... thank you for saving me"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-huh."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An espionage that sticks to your chest and buries your face. Roaring, its shoulders are shaking with pull.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan's... stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid big bugger!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was there....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi that pounds my chest many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stroked my head and tried to stop it, but my right arm was dead and my left arm was in trouble, so I couldn't do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yikes, espi...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhhh, fight Gouda alone and do so many dangerous things! I'm worried! I did it! I did it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, I see...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You must have worried me so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, even in this era, there won't be anyone who will be Tyman against Rokkai, so Espi is right. I'm certainly stupid, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, it's coming down! Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as soon as I slowly got down on the ground, Slaya rushed towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, are you okay!? Uhh... oh, oniisan really is... Ralweif! Take care of your brother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ahh, mmm...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan was so cool... but..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This way, my eyes are sparkling as if I was dissatisfied at first, but I can't suppress my excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a cute thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey... what happened to Gouda-san...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?... ahh... it's gone"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, Ralwyev put his hand against my arm and said healing magic, asking me how restless he was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, for this demon King army, I don't think he's been able to sort out the situation where the corner of the Roku-hachi died in front of his eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm lucky to be a legendary witness... oniisan..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... chief..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief who scolds me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Espi and Slaya leaned against me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, oniichan! I defeated Rokuha! Nine brave men haven't done it yet, but oniichan did it! Oniichan, you're the best in the world! Nfu! My brother is the best in the world!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Legend... hero... yes, oniisan really did that! The world should know more! We all need to know more about how amazing our brother is!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Legends", "heroes" and "the best in the world" praise me as if I were you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't feel bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... no, Espi, Slaya. Gouda was defeated by... hero Hyiro..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... huh??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the truth is different, we can't just play with the records carved into history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Why, oniichan! Oniichan beat you!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rather than knocking down, Gouda had a lifespan ~ I just sang with her...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't know what that means, oniisan! Why don't you tell me the truth? You're going to give the brave men some leverage?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's okay... so..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya are naturally not convinced, but they are very angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The truth of history... will only be in the breasts of everyone here."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm not going to name myself... is that so, oniisan? Yeah... Earth Ragan."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I heard the chief's words, the spirits ate me with a happy face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes! Hey, oniichan's name is Earth? Does it have anything to do with Hyiro?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right, oniisan. There are a lot of things I don't understand...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I want elementary school students to teach me. And over time....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps the chief knows everything. Think about me in general.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But neither Espi, nor Slaya, nor Ralwyev.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what I am.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the meantime, I can't even do that. The Allies will come when we're on the lookout... and let's go talk to the underground lab... and everyone will be worried..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bh ~, I want to hear it right now ~... then, let me know if we all go to Japone's mountain now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know how far my journey in this era has come.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'll tell you right away...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, of course I want to ask... but oniisan will be tired too, and I can't help it... later."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slaya, who don't suspect I'm still with them.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, right away."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to talk now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who am I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm... a shisonotami item, and I don't know if it was an accident... but it came from the future more than a decade from now..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "As I said, my real name is Earth Lagan. The seven brave Hiero and Maam were married, and were born between them."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ""............ Ho???
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We... have to say goodbye...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
