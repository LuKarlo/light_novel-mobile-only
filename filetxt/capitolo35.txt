 The main street of Imperial City was more crowded than usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were shops lined up like in a festival, from early in the morning was overflowing with parents bringing along their children and adults taking a day off from work, and everyone was heading for the same place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An amphitheater usually used for entertainment that can accommodate thousands of people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today’s event is The Imperial Warrior Academy [Graduation Commemorative Match].
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This tournament selects the best among the newcomers who have yet to become warriors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The event is not a small one, but also a showcase of young people who will bear the future of Imperial City. It is a grand event with a long-standing tradition and style in which not only the commoners but also nobles and the Imperial family including the Emperor watch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, some patrons stop their carriages in front of the arena, and from the passenger cabin escort guards and the gorgeously dressed elite were seen. With more security than usual, some warriors wore armbands throughout the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s such an important event for the Empire, much less this year’s match which is a little different from the usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, who do you think will win today?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you go in order, it’ll probably be the Princess or a Rebal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m here for Rebal~! He’s too cool!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, by far I’m with Mr. Fu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu is super first class as a mage too, but what about the duels?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you don’t understand, do you? The matchups will be announced on the day, so if the Princess and Rebal face each other early…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Earth might be the dark horse here.” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can also hear my name in the conversation among the guests arriving at the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s only natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Today, four children of the Seven Heroes who defeated the Great Demon King and saved the human race and the world over ten years ago will come out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re all looking forward to seeing the next generation of heroes and the potential for the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho. Seems quite the success. Though tis a game between children.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That’s just what peace means compared to your time.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. If so, as a matter of fact… tis quite the exciting situation that draws out one’s spirit.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I tried to run around the venue for a warm-up, Tre’ainar mentioned that he was impressed as I saw where people were getting into the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m ready to fight myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I carefully performed shadow and ladder training to get peak level performance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, it’s about time I got in too…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As many people gather at the main gate of the Arena, I go in through the back door used for officials and contestants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the square in front of the entrance going straight through a narrow corridor that leads directly into the arena, everyone else had gathered and was waiting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Moh? You’re finally here, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, good morning!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When they saw me, the Princess and Fu ran up to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m finally here… I’ve been around the venue for a long time, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was taking a little walk…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Easy Going guy. Do you really know what today is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right? Earth. I’ll tell you… me…… fighting Earth, I won’t go easy on you, got it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Won’t go easy on me. Usually, when you say, ‘I fight with all my strength’, you’re just trying to say that ‘I’m superior’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe he’s saying it unconsciously. In other words, Fu unconsciously believes he’s much stronger than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking down on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Same with me, right? To win, I won’t lose the championship. To anyone… That’s it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the Princess also sees a man with a cool atmosphere, his eyes closed in the corner of the room, as if declaring war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s trying to unify his spirit with a cold air as if he was saying, ‘Nobody speak to me’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, either he was done or he noticed my existence, he opened his eyes, glanced my way and came up to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two people facing each other. Rebal had confessed, but there is no sweet atmosphere present.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll win.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t lose.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They clash and show off their will to ‘not lose’ to each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from my point of view, it doesn’t seem like the mood matches.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tch, are they going out already?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu… How are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m in my best shape.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… When I think about it, I’ve been studying abroad with you for a year, but this may be the first time I’ve fought you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, going with the flow, Rebal turns eyes to Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu’s childish face also changes completely, and he shows a manly smile as sparks fly between him and Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, this selection match is a tournament of 16 contenders, so there are others in sync besides us, it’s just like they’re saying, ‘someone among us will win’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, it feels like they’re nervous yet they can’t afford to be.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Rebal looked at me last…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m in this tournament… No matter who sees it, I’ll show off the obvious difference in power and win the championship and prove my all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To the Empire… To the people… To his majesty… To my father and the former heroes. And…… To the princess to whom I offer my sword.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A declaration of war on me… Or rather, all I hear is ‘I’ll win the championship’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two months ago, I would have said it back here, but since it was on appointed the day, I can’t stand it with just words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… hmmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I retort with just that and turned my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shut them out and suppress my emotions!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hey, Earth! What’s that attitude towards Rebal! If you’re a man, say it back! That…… here, you too. I… what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not like Earth, is it? Right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess and Fu agitate me, but I don’t take any part of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… two months ago, just saying that, is that your answer today? Earth. Well, it doesn’t matter to me anymore, but… at least you’ll try not to fall before you fight us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps he lost interest in me with that, Rebal looks at me with a slightly cold eye, but I won’t say anything back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kukukuku… Your patience wears thin, does it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only person who understands my feelings right now is Tre’ainar, who has a grinning smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Yes, I can’t stand it anymore.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think I could endure so much yet not raise my clenched fist or say anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I had talked with Rebal anymore, I would have said, ‘Let’s go! I want to end the fight right now’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was looking forward to it, just like Rebal was doing everything today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I decided.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s all I can bear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Is something wrong, child? For some reason, your expression tells me you have a fiendish scheme in mind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. I don’t think I can put up with it anymore. So if I’m doing this, I’ll do it quickly.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoho… Hmmm. I see. Your malicious intent is oozing out, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Any complaints?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tis intriguing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tournaments will soon begin…… a lottery beforehand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tournament bracket is decided by drawing lots in front of the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I thought I’d give my response, everything I wanted to say here, in front of a large crowd anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The term originally used here is ‘ [漁夫の利] ’ which literally means ‘Benefit of a Fisherman’. It’s meant to describe a situation where 2 parties fighting over a prize occupy each other when an unexpected 3rd party would swoop in and take it for themselves. Basically the speaker believes the only way for Earth to win is for the competition to take each other out. I opted for Dark Horse instead since it gets the point across better for English speakers.
