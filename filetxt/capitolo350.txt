<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain, take this...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I keep the money in the depository. That's the bill of exchange. I owe you....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This debt... means one day... right? Keep writing the Distinguished Series....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After one treatment, we went back to the basement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well then, oniisan. Put the master key on the elevator. The hierarchy we're going to now is where we need to be. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm totally unfamiliar with this move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey oniichan. What do you mean by that? Your brother's Hiro and Maam's kids? Hey, hey!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm from the future... that's really..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... from the future... I've never heard of such magic... and the future means... war... what's going on with war?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is dim and continues to have passageways made of materials that have never seen ceilings or walls in the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not where the wives are waiting, but the chief says, "Go here first."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm Sisonotami... which means I wanted this place... to go back to the future."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh... change... ru?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espy and slayer with a crisp face. It's impossible not to swallow my story yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, here it is. Oniisan, I need a master key on the door again."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ahh"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there was a door behind the dark passage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the chief told me, I'll take out the master key.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, thinking that the center of the door suddenly flashed red, the door opened freely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ooh... no matter what comes, I'm not surprised anymore"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dark world spreading behind the door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the chief stepped into the room,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, the room was lit up with light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh, what is this? The magic of light? I was surprised again..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? It suddenly got brighter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is anybody there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can't feel the magic... what the hell..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual, the chieftain will be jealous without prior explanation, but it seems to be harmless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The hierarchy that you can't come in without using the Master Key... the doors that you can't get in... that is, the rooms that are ahead of you are not stepping in any more."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna used to explore the ruins, and the people who lived in Sisonotami used the ruins, but it was only a fraction of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the ancients used to have in this basement is deeper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what I'm here for.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh......"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's big....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What room...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what is this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The room that was lit was spacious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A long desk arranged in a staircase and a fixed chair. Does it look a little like the Academy classroom at first glance?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The walls are set up like giant glass stretched out on one side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The main computer room... is the power still alive... If you left, you should just turn it off... well, thanks to you, I can recharge and oniisan can go home."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Konpyuta? Den? Chief, what language are you speaking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chief walks before the glazing, and sits in the seat before him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when the chief lightly moved the desk in the seat where he sat with his fingertips, a part of the desk turned up, and something like a board and a depression with a mysterious pattern appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is just a fraction of the lab. The ancients, who once descended from a distant star into this world but could not adapt to this terrestrial environment, created shelters in the subterranean world, and even at the end of repeated experiments to adapt to the environment... they multiplied the genes of this world to create experiments like Sky Clans and me, Kaguya-sama, to blend into this world..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... Kaguya..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ancients... there are no more Inhumans called Ancients who lived beneath the Sisonottami... abandoned Kagya, and then the prosperous city of Sisonottami has already perished... no time, no time, no time to study history."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Someday... I guess... oh, yeah. More than that right now, the rest of my time... it's hard for me to spend..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the chief moves the depression with the same familiar handwriting as at the door earlier, a huge glass stretched on one side of the wall suddenly glows, and the pattern that has never been seen as bright color is largely reflected, and furthermore....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Gacha
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" "" Hmm!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The drawer of the desk where the chief was sitting suddenly opened with a noise, and inside it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, the clock!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, it's full of them...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The same thing as the watch I had was tied to something like a string in the drawer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, oniisan, lend it to me. I'll connect it to the cord and charge it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know why. When I handed the clock to the chief, the chief stuck the strange pointed string in a small depression on the clock that I didn't even notice, and the clock lit up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the meantime... oniisan, where should I put you back in years?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, ah... uh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Setup? Uh, what do you mean? How many years later? Is that when I came?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Gouda died in battle... Speaking of which, in the future, you didn't realize the date... child, what was the date of your game?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Um, um, it's like... it was a year 2000 × × month..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in terms of calculation... the number of days to run away from home, travel, and stay in Cacletail... it's about 2000 years and × × days from now. It may be around a few days..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, in x x days, in a year from now"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Copy that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm glad Traina's here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the sheik is clamping my watch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this... if it wasn't for the chief, I wouldn't know anything...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Still... I have a few clocks... is that the same thing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A timeless item nodded sharply.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Whoa, I can't believe there's so many of these... if I misuse them..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Items that can travel to and from the past and the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can handle this freely, you can do anything....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Everything is tough."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the chief denied it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There's only one person who can travel alone, and there's no halfway load on the flesh, and it can only be used a few times in a lifetime."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This isn't magic, it's technology. The computer analyzes the human body, transfers molecules, reconstructs them... well, to put it simply, organs, blood vessels, bones and so on can become messed up and die. Not for use at least in growing children. That's why I think oniisan was pretty close. I did hear in the experiment that people who had traveled four or five times died of a total mess."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "This is the product of a technology that the ancients accidentally acquired. But it was too risky, so it was forbidden to use it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't really understand the first explanation, but only the last one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, can't you use this often?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I'm sure that my father and mother came to this era once when they were kids, twice, and then three times because I'm leaving.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, ah, ahhhhhh ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see... transferring molecular information and rebuilding it... the principle of moving distortions in space and space is the same, but is it different from the magic of space transfer... Indeed, it's a dangerous substitute."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina was also roaring at the chief's explanation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi of the future will give me such a dangerous thing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I mean, if I go home with this... I really can't go back to this era anymore..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you've already used it a few times... well, that's true... there's no guarantee of your life."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Okay, so we can't go back and see what happened to Espi and Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So now....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey oniichan. What do you mean, go home? Where are you going? Now? Then I'll go get it because I left my stuff with the ethers."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan. Are you going now? Not after we've delivered the elves? Well, if oniisan says he's going, we'll just follow him...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know anything about you two.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi... Slaya..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... here... goodbye"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ………………………… ........................!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, I knew it... but my chest hurts...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "…………………………………………… Eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
