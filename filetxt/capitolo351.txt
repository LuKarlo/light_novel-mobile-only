<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, where are you going? What do you mean goodbye? I'm coming, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words that tighten your chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You still don't understand what I'm saying... no, you think it's impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's no way I'm going to say goodbye here with you two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I have to tell you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry... I can't take you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, Slaya... here..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It hurts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How heavy... but... I have to tell you...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Say goodbye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I met her, she forgave me, and the expression of the Espi that always smiled on me hardened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Do you understand...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I can't be here anymore. Back in the future... back in time. I'm going to say goodbye to all of you who live in this era."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to take you away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can't.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I squeezed my fist so hard that it bleeds, but still....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that doesn't convince Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yaaa!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lie down, shake your shoulders, sharpen your lips, your eyes are full of tears, and....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, I won't do anything bad. If you do something bad, I'll do it again! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Bring it on! So....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi jumped at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crying, desperately.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, Espi. You're not bad. I didn't do anything. You can grow up as you are now. It's my fault."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll make it better! I won't be selfish! Oniichan, I won't let you! I don't want any more crazy shit! I don't need any clothes! That's why I'm going to reduce it! That's why... that's why... no... no... no... no... no! Don't be a pain!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Throw it away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't take him. I have to go home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's my situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From an espionage point of view, what I'm doing is irreplaceable, even if you think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi... sorry..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here we are--"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yaaaa!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were too connected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew this would happen if I told you this story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No! No, no, no, no! Yaaaaa! No, no, no, no!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An espionage that clings to my neck and crys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like I will never let go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the second time I've made my sister cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I finally...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Ah, I followed you. You make my sister cry, you're the worst niisama ever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I first met Espi in the future, Espi said that to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what that word meant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're right, Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like when I'm an amae, I really suck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And not just my sister today....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan... why did you... abandon us?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even my brother.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's not true. You're my precious sister and brother."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then... why... why don't you take us with you! I'm not obsessed with the times! If oniisan's going to the future, take us with you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No way...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't want to! That's not true!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya grabbed my arm and screamed desperately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya, who is not always a child, has tears in her eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, not just my sister, but even my brother....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [Charging Gas Completion Shimmer]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then, the words of the end echoed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oniisan... just push the switch and you'll jump. So... where are the coordinates... in the right place? Is this the right place for the future?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No... the place is... the port town of Genkan... that's where they have to go... to see me. They've been waiting for over a decade..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... yeah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We don't have much time. The chief works indifferently, laughing bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kid, do we have to bring one of those clocks to the esprit of our time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If the Espi doesn't give it to you in the future, you can't come to this era."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah, I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna reminded me of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The future espionage gave me this watch with the risk of dying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I gave it to you in the first place... ahh... that kind of thing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain. And one more clock... when the time comes, I want you to leave it with the Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "To Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right. And one day, I want you to give it to me. Settings in this era....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I see... That's how it is...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that the chief understood with this explanation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really appreciate it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I'm a child. When you gave this watch to Espi initially, you were playing with me... and even older than this era... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, I see... haha... 'There's no point in setting it up'... that's what I mean..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does that mean you're lucky to have been able to come to this era with so much fuss and ruin your settings...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan! I don't know! Don't try to cum! Don't go!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I was lucky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we can meet these guys.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, both of you. I wanted to play more with you... Carrie, I wanted to eat... more... I'm sorry... I'm the worst brother I ever made you cry... I'm really sorry..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hugged them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now let's play! Let's eat Carrie too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, no! Me, me...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hold the little two bodies tightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, my eyes are hot. I'm crying too... you idiot! It's my fault. What am I gonna do when I cry?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't deserve to cry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I gave Espi a ribbon, and I gave Slaya this."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I caught something in my pocket and came out with a knife.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's a memory of everyone camping and playing curry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I don't want it! I don't want you to stay with me...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hold this knife.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Along with Espi... get along. You're the only one who can handle Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uu... uu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something to forget. This warmth. This thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To apologize from the bottom of my heart to you who have been waiting for more than a decade in the future....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, you're not alone. You're the only ones in this world who know me. Even if the world doesn't know, you know me. So, you two... get along."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not you two... you're not here... you're not there... it's better for you..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With your bigger future... we'll see each other again. Absolutely. At that time, let's eat a lot of curry. Let's play a lot. I'll stay with you forever..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will make amends for you in the future, no matter how long it takes, even if you do not forgive me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chieftain... Ralviv... you're the only ones in this era who know the truth about me but Espi and Slaya... let them care about you two..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... oniisan also owes us money for saving our lives... that kind of thing..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want you to keep an eye on these two and help me sometimes. The chief nodded with a smile when he asked them for his thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You said Earth. Even if you are still said to be Hiro or Maam's child, you will not come... even if it is true... even if you are really from the future... is it the Aka of the future that made you a friend?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I nodded honestly to Ralviv asking about Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, is Aka... alive until that time... is that so?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Ralviv looked up at the ceiling and wept in his eyes, but smiled a little and put his hand gently on the shoulders of the crying espire and slayer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Espi, Slaya. A sudden breakup with a loved one, the pain of not seeing each other, is painfully understood by the pupils. But there is hope. To the future. Someday we can meet... always... because that's what a man from the future says."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ral....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And so did the elementary school students. The elementary school boy will live."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralviv seems to have given an answer. He held Slaya and Espi with his lost and hopeful eyes and declared so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I was fighting in a world without Aka, and I thought I could die at any time. When I found out that Aka was alive, I looked back on my past, couldn't forgive the ugly history, and even thought of dying. But not now. Elementary school students live. Even a bloody and ugly elementary student can someday meet Aka honorably with his chest up... and live a proud life, and one day he will definitely go to see Aka. I swear to God, even for Aony... that's why you guys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "U, uu... uu... why do you want to stay with oniichan forever...?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why you'll live strong and have a chest full of life... and one day this man will hug you. Whatever it is, hit him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ralviv's words would have resonated heavily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not easy to convince, and neither Espi nor Slaya will stop crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'll see you again someday. And remember all four of my stories now. In the near future, a child named Earth Ragan will be born between Hiiro and Maam. And when the child turns 15, he refrains from graduating from the Academy, and there is a match in front of the Academy in the Empire, where Earth Ragan runs away. Afterwards, there was a fighting tournament in the clandestine country Cacretail, and a few days after that, we could meet. After the cockroach tail, I was in Genkan. I still don't know about you then... but I'll definitely come and see you when I love you. In that case, I don't care how many shots you shoot."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's an incredible number of years just to say it. We must keep them waiting for more than ten years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm still keeping you waiting. Find them in the future.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You are waiting for us in the future. That's why I'm going. Listen, I'm gonna tell you again and again. I love you guys!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Receive the clock from the chief, stroke again the head of Espi and Slaya, who cry in Ralwyev's arms, and I swear again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Next time I see you, I'll be with you even if I turn everything in the world against you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then I started the clock, and the light enveloped me with the transfer team.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan... uhh... ahh... onii-chan!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onei... sa... nh..."

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
