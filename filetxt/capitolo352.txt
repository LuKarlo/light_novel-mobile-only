<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sorrow of that time will never be forgotten.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just remembering it makes me cry even now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oniichan disappeared that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You said you loved it. You told me nothing was wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He left me and Slaya behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would you do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If oniichan hadn't been here, I wouldn't have told anybody else....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --If we meet again... when will we meet again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn't know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After listening to the explanations of the chief and Lar, neither I nor Slaya understood at the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I wasn't convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But just one thing, Mr. Lar told me many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That man didn't lie. I'm sure you'll see each other again. When Hyiro and Maam's children are born and grow older.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was incredible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither I nor Slaya have been in a new Elf settlement for a while and have been blocking it for days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in that way, I realized that Slaya and I had to do something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Espi, what do you mean, back in the Allied army? Why are you throwing yourself into war again? Do you think your brother would want that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, I've made up my mind... Mr. Lar. Gouda is dead, but the Demon King army is still strong and the hyenas are pinch....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Is that... for my old buddies?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Not at all. Because... if either Hiro or Maam dies, oniichan won't be born!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, if it's true that oniichan is a child of Hyiro and Maam, if something happens to Hyiro and Maam, oniichan will not be born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won't be able to see oniichan in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I definitely hated that kind of thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Return to the Allies. Hyiro and Maam... if one of them dies, you won't be able to see oniichan... you'll never be able to... protect them, defeat the Devil King, and let oniichan be born!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the answer I gave at the time, and I thought it was something to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I will act with everyone in the meantime. I need to be alert to my mates, hunters, and now Japone's Samurai, Ninja, and war escapees... if oniisan protects all the elves... then I will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Yes, if both me and Slaya are gone, it might be dangerous just for Laru and the chief....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --When I see oniisan again, I'll be sad if the elves are gone.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --That's right, you're right, Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ah. If you get fucked up, you run away... because if anything happens, I'll have oniisan all alone in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 'm not dying! The Demon King army is coming fast!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was me who went missing from the Allied army, but just when I joined, Hiiro and the others appeared in the Alliance's pinch in a pinch scene. At that time, I became a hero and became suspicious that I was no longer silent. At that time, my companions also welcomed me with pleasure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bethel said a lot, but after I came back, I managed to do something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --You 're alive, Espi! Good for you! Really! And you made a good run for it! You're our best friend!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Thank you, Espi. And I promise. Next time anything happens to you, we'll protect you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don't think I was still open to everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --The feeling of thinking about fellow believers creates a miracle. We can get past any wall! Isn't that right, Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you got there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For your people?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I fight for oniichan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You look like an idiot. I wanted you not to get me wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Espi, can you sweeten us up? If you have a problem with the Bethel Kingdom, you can always tell me! It's gonna help! You're one of us and you're my sister!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I want to cum. And the next time I say "sister," I'll punch you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ah, hey, Espi. What a... difficult princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hate hyero. It's about time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Come on, I'll stroke your head. Nice, nice...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ ─ Don't touch it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Whoa!? Gyaaaaaaaaaaaa!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Hyiro tries to touch my head without permission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could not forgive myself if I died.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't bother at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I'm not Hiro's sister! Don't touch your head! Next time you touch it, it's not just a bump!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't joke. Don't joke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't touch my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is only one person in the world who can touch me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I Hiro's sister? Shut up. Shut up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My brother is the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's only one brother in the world, only one brother in the coolest world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't care what happens to you when oniichan is born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's how I endured it, but still Hiro and Maam fought for sure, thinking they couldn't let him die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Miss Espi....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Kojiro... what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 'm not asking deep... but I just want one answer. Is this how you fight the oils... with your life ahead of you... what you want?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - What's that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I don't know what happened to oniisan... but I thought you were in a lot of trouble... because you were burned at first... but I don't think you're looking for something and trying to protect something in your battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kojiro didn't ask me what happened to his brother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Kojiro initially thought that oniichan was dead, and that made me feel burned and raging in the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But you know I'm not like that at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kojiro is not good at discerning various things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Yeah, I'm gonna see oniichan again... so I'm gonna fight...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I see. Well, then, Oila would be a little more useless than you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don't hate Kojiro that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ---...... ah......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ---...... ah......
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes at the Allied headquarters, Sadis, protected by Maam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've never had anything to do with Thaddeus before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Thaddeus is a poor girl with no family and only Maam, so I also met my brother, so I couldn't leave him alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - You can call me Oneechan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ah, uh, um....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I occasionally decided to play with Sadie and get along with her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Hiro and the others can't. I won't let you stroke it. I won't be a sister either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll just protect you. Oniichan was born in this world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - The war is over! We win! And as of today, we will end the battle between man and magic! Don't kill anyone anymore!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even after the war, I waited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fought occasionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Wow, I won't let Hiro marry you! I've done such a thing... I may have wanted to hide my identity under the name of Lagerman or something, but I can't fool you! Let them take responsibility!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - I'll fight you, Slaya! I don't want to interrupt Hiro's marriage to Maam! Plus, Lagerman isn't Hiro! Oniichan's kind of... ah...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Bye, idiot, Espi! That's.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ----hey? What do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fight... taka... yeah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Come on, Sadie, let the espi hold you too ♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --uu...... then, let's make it special! But it's only ten seconds! Espi, onee-chan can't do this forever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally understood that my brother wasn't lying at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --This is my new family, Hiro and Thaddeus... Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Ah... ah... ground... that name...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --uu... yes, it's been ten seconds. That's it, kid. The time to hug is over. Sadis is the only one who can hold him forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was true. Everything oniichan said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why we can really see each other again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Slaya! I'm good! Oniichan's good! His name is Earth! Oniichan! It's oniichan after all!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Really!? So... really... really, really one day we'll meet up with our brother...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I did it... I did it! We'll see oniisan again!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, I did it! You did it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were delighted to jump with our hands tied together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, that was the first time Slaya and I were happy with our heartfelt smiles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were so happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just waiting didn't really know if such a future would come, but knowing that the future was bound to come, we finally had hope.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I can work harder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I began to think of waiting hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― ― Today's coalition meeting is about the bokumates family. The recent arrest of Inai the boss in our Empire weakens the organization. On the other hand, we must not let the remnants and other missing executives go unnoticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That's right. Me and Solja... no... Your Majesty was able to catch Inai, but with the other militant leaders, it would have been a little more hassle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 've heard that story before. Oira has information that a thousand Yakuza hunters, well known in the backworld for their militant cadres Detecone, Devanasi, Yallarata, have entered Japone's territory with their brothers, but they're still out there... don't you think? And Hiro. Isn't it uncomfortable to call Solja Your Majesty?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I worked hard on the front. But Slaya isn't as good as me, but I guess you did your best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You destroyed all the militant executives of the Bokumates family trying to find and capture elves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I have to keep it a secret because if it shows up, they'll find out about the elf settlement.

 Looking back on the past, I couldn't calm myself or Slaya, as tears were about to burst, smiles were about to burst, and I was nervous at the same time.

 We've waited and waited since we dropped off "Earth Ragan."
