<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have something that hasn't changed since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Amix really likes that book.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, Mom! I love this book your father wrote...!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A work written by my father, who was writing when I was still innocent and didn't know anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I learned to read and write in my father's book, I memorized the story in full.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The story is so loved and unknown by the same generation of children in my settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Dad, I want you to write more of this novel like the Distinguished Series.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Hmm? Ah, well, anyway... eventually... when the time comes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only dissatisfaction with this novel is that your father didn't write it, even though he wanted to see more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I love this story to the extent that I'm only dissatisfied with my beloved father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hello, amix.Are you reading that book again?You really like this book...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Of course... you're already memorizing it, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Shouldn't I? Niisan... sister...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah! There's nothing you can't do ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Well, I like that book, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My sister Espi and brother Slaya, who have come to this village often since childhood to give me souvenirs, play with me, teach me how to study, and take me to the nearby city with Kosuri.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The race is human and different from our elves, but for me and everyone in the settlement, it is just like family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --This protagonist boy is good... it's not justice or evil, and it's his conviction that penetrates through it... the boys in this village are attracted to a passionate figure... and above all, the family thoughts that take care of his younger sister and brother...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, yeah. â™ª
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, you're right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Besides, even I barely know the outside world outside this village... when I'm reading this book, it feels like I'm adventuring outside with you... strange...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --That's not funny. It's not strange at all.This boy is cool, isn't he?My sister is so cute!You're cuter than my brother!You're cute!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --No, no, I think it's better for my brother.My sister is a bum, she's a crybaby... yeah, I'd rather have my brother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Fufu... and my brother and sister... but this hero boy... if he exists in reality, he must have defeated the Great Demon King once and saved the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That's not true!This boy is much cooler than a hero!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Yeah, yeah. That's all you agree with Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father writes a lot of works, but many of them are special to me, and my favorite story has always been and continues to be this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I say it publicly from a young age, my sister and brother are very happy and adore me very much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I love those two too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But lately....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I can't believe it... I can't believe it!Why!? What is it!?Empire... they... they... what are they!?Hiro and Maam are useless!Yursanai! I want to kill you now!I can't forgive you... why... why... what a terrible thing...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --How dare you insult our brother... it's been so long since I've felt so angry... I want to protect my injured brother now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - No, no, calm down.After the game, after the journey... a few months later, in Genkan, right?What if we make extra moves here and history becomes chaotic?You've both been waiting for over a decade, haven't you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Exactly. Calm down a little, both of you.Well, even though I don't know what anger is when something important gets scolded...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, I've been talking to my sister, brother, father, and teacher together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn't hide my surprise from my emotionally angry sister and brother, who I could never see in front of me or anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And they won't tell me why or why.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I'm a child?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm still 15 years old in a long-lived elf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, elves will grow up like humans until they reach the age of 20, and aging from them will slow down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When my sister and brother were fifteen, I thought it was like another person, so I am a kind of immature half person, but I think half of them are adults.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Is that it? Amix, is that clothing... new?I gave you a whole bunch of backs the other day, didn't I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Sorry, sister.I mean... um, my chest... is so tight to me...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ------Eh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 'm sorry! My sister gave it to me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --I 'm a little, yeah, confident, but... hey, amix... you've grown up again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At least I think my body is one of the adults.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I'm kind of lonely outside the mosquito net....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that was the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!? Dad... what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? That's why you're right.I've been asking for Amix since I was a kid.... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, but... but why suddenly?Why are you writing all of a sudden!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Have you ever had such a shock?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My God, my father told me to write a sequel to my favorite novel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course I was happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Your father wrote this story more than a decade ago.In the meantime, my father didn't write me an ambiguous response, even though I repeatedly asked him to continue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did you suddenly start writing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha, it's not sudden... you've been saying that all along.When the time comes... it's just that it's finally here. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then he smiled as if he remembered the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a slightly twisted spot with a frustrating, frustrating smile from your father, who didn't laugh very much, and....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Finally, the story begins..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, he put up the "Lagerman Adventure" in his hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
