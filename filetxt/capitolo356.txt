<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Not Sisonotami, first bypass it, then elf settlement?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of us had no choice but to sleep like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suppose it means that you two won't be able to leave me... but you won't be able to leave me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's like, before you go to bed, "What do you want me to do tomorrow?Espi and Slaya said that to me first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan's money buys land, stretches boundaries there, and the elf settlements still exist.The chiefs have always wanted to thank oniichan and want to see him. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Since then, we've been going to and staying in elf settlements on a regular basis.I've been telling the chief that it's time to see oniisan again. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really... with the chief..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, it was yesterday, but for them, it's been as long as Espi and Slaya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was relieved that the Elf settlement had survived properly for more than a decade.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, well, let's go."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! I'm looking forward to it! Besides, there are kids who want to see oniichan ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, let's go to bed early for tomorrow!Espi, you're in the way. Go away.A lewd body like you is not good for oniisan's future education. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's not true ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have trouble sleeping, but is it okay about today?Espi has grown a lot, but I don't think it's strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, you're a family...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, maybe I'm an adult after all the encounters and experiences.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kron, Sinov, Sadis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A while ago, I panicked and was upset when I got stuck with a woman with a nice body, but I guess I'm not that kind of kid anymore?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, after all the encounters and battles, I may have grown up a lot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, this is how they survived the Six Heights fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm getting stronger...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Super Spiral Devil Spiral Catastrophe!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!???"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I grew up and I grew stronger... how dare you shatter my nose pillars into pieces with so much force that I almost fell in love with you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Um, the world of Vyar... I wonder what it is now... or the end of the world... finally...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, Traina... now... I don't know why anymore"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was not at the level of pieces or pieces of meat, but it disappeared without a single cell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When you come this far, the feeling of being scared, or "what the hell", only boils.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't even know if it's an evolutionary version of the Great Demon Spiral anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Somehow, I know that Trainer is as different as ever...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've been through a lot of fighting with Yamidiré, Palippi, Noja, Gouda, and so on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legendary titles that used to rival my dads.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, it's about you anyway.I would have thought that I would have fallen in love with Noja in the past and won Gouda. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, I'm sorry! I thought, damn it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Footwork, speed, technology, eyesight, foresight, using all kinds of technology, and after that fierce battle with Gouda, I thought I was peeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I lost to Trainer as usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Who the hell do you think you are?You did cross the six heights and beat Gouda.However, Yu was the Great Demon King who tied up the Six Heights.Imagine that fighting the rest means fighting all six of the Six Heights. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... uhh... uhh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Six... I've never met Yamidiré, Palippi, Noja, Gouda, and Hakuki, but Riphant... at the same time as all six hegemons... ah, that won't win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You know what I mean? The rest were certainly dead once... but they fought with all seven of the seven brave men who paired up with the Six Heights at the same time, so it's inevitable that they would have beaten Hiro if they were one-on-one!In other words, children still have a lot to learn!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ugh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In other words, I know that I can be reconnected with my sister and brother, and even though I can't help coming on a future trip, I can't be too cool... even if I'm just too lazy!That's why the rest of your workouts will be the same, okay?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, yes!All right, Shinobi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, that's good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought you were back in this era because you got stronger, but on the contrary, you just figured out the difference in power between Trainer and me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I almost dropped my shoulders.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, well... you're getting stronger."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!? Seriously!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The word struck my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... um... otherwise Gouda won't be rewarded.He's not a loser to those half-wives. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... I see..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... you did well... you took my last wish and you took the end of Gouda... well done..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was relieved to hear that and feel a little relieved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Traina didn't like to praise me, so she turned around, but still I was so happy that my heart was filled with enthusiasm at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina... hey... I'm still getting stronger!I didn't want Gouda to laugh at me... and... I carried Aony too.That's why I'm still asking!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm. That's something to be prepared for."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's strong enough... oh, my God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I vowed to Traina that I would still be strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nevertheless, that's all for today."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's unusual for Vyar to train all night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Now... let's try to roar the rest of the dish."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina embodied camping equipment, vegetables, spices, and more in the world of Voyages.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let me eat more curry tonight.Grade me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this world, me and Trainer can embody everything.Sometimes it embodies what you eat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eating that mesh doesn't fill your stomach and nourish your body, but you can taste it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why tonight?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, even if they say so, the taste itself is not as good as it has ever been....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eat it!Start Curry and check out his culinary skills as he moves around the world!In general, while saying that we are going to travel the world by ourselves, the skill and taste of cooking is also good for cultivating the skills and senses of our hands!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And since it has become stronger, there will be no reduction in training, so I have been able to do other things from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it's okay because it's not painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
