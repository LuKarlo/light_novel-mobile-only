<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Kidding?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah ♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I woke up in the morning, packed my stuff, and said, "Come on, let's go for the elf settlement!Espi and Slaya suggested it to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm going to go to that place, but it will take time to walk.Well, I don't mind if I take my time... but I was thinking about playing with you. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan will follow me and Slaya as we lead the way."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I finally understood the meaning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I see... the opposite of what I did before..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two laughed bitterly at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "In the old days, oniisan's movements didn't have any hands or feet... but now what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan. We're getting stronger.Now it's time to fight with oniichan and protect him.As usual, I'm not the only seven brave men the country has saved up and forced to take.Well, I don't really need such a title anymore ♪ "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The genius Slayer and the seven heroes of Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike me, they had fifteen years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those two men, who could only fight on their blessed abilities, could not keep up with my movements.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now I'm confident it's not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see. Indeed, my powers, which have just returned to this era yesterday, remain those of the last battle you saw against Gouda.Are you saying that I was already beyond it? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked you to make fun of me, they....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's not what I'm saying.Neither we nor the power of the Six Heights will underestimate Oniisan's power to defeat the Six Heights.Oniisan's power back then... we were aiming for that. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I just want you to see it!We did our best!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those two smiled not "stronger than me", but the feeling of "look at us now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you say such a thing, there is no reason to refuse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I know better than anyone what it's like to want you to look at yourself now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All right, both of you.I'll catch up with you.So show me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes! Fufufu, I haven't played with oniisan since the deck of that ship.Yes, it's a memory of me and oniisan ♪ "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mhh! I was the only one left!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, the other day.But I feel happy that it's a very nostalgic memory for both of us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, I can't lose my brother's majesty easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll eat you desperately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... mountainous area of Japone... no matter how fast it takes to run from here... a few days..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few days. Traina seemed to be thinking about something or something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yiiiiiiiiiiiing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah! Zulu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before we know it, Espy and Slayer dash off the spot with a little flying feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Running through the woods at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, do it... don't lick oniisan like that!Let's see how much you two have become!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I'll go after him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The lush trees also detect their position in advance on the radar and identify the shortest route in the magical parquet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, there you are, oniisan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah! I miss that move ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Just follow the plan, Espi."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know. And that light... be careful when Noja says" Breakthrough "is activated."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, I'll get caught as soon as I'm out of my mind."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two who ran ahead looked back, but looked happy somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think you can afford it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it's not just the limbs that are stretching, it's also running smoothly and without waste.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think you can afford it? No, I think we still have plenty of room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Always run the shortest route, gradually fill the distance... and we'll catch you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, let me see while you chase--
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kid, this trick... it's going to be a pretty good training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the trainer beside me whispered to me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of playing with this, I thought it was part of the training, so I seriously chased those two.I'm not looking at you from the top, but at you as a challenger. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From what Trainer suggests, the power of Slayer and Espi is growing so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not all....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't think it's a simple trick.This will be an enduring battle.And that will be the challenge for future children..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "For now, it's good to experience what children have to wear next."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't think this is a proper training session for a trick-or-treat showdown that celebrates your brother's reunion with your sister and brother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it certainly makes sense for Traina to say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I decided to chase them with all my strength as I grew up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
