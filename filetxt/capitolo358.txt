<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two of you who were supposed to be following me next to me and behind me are running in front of me with long arms and legs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But they look back at me from time to time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was kind of happy about that, and I was motivated to "catch up with you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Magical Radar! Shortest route ahead!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Track their movements with their eyes and radar in conjunction with the surrounding situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I concentrated in my head and saw the light route.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical Shining Road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan, driftstone!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, they're gonna follow us in the shortest route for nothing while they're previewing our movements."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Will this catch up with the acceleration of breakthroughs when the distance is reduced?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right ♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The movement of Espi and Slaya is only adult, growing and sophisticated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that's not all.That's the problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If these two are genuine, Six Heights classes, it's easy to catch up with them like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "All right, fluffy turn!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the next moment, they dispersed simultaneously in completely unexpected directions from the forward movement of the two muscles and the orientation of the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Running in an unexpected direction, I stopped unexpectedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's not feint. That was.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "The power of espionage."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "By forcibly changing the flow and orientation of myself and Slayer's body within my abilities, I was able to overcome the child's predictions."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. He's taken one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Changing my behavior just momentarily makes my predictions impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhaha... you'll do it quickly, Espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nhihi! Not yet!Fluffy obstacle!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you think you got out of me, that's not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, the Espi blocked me in front of me with trees in the woods and rocks falling around it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's not just running away."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stop my legs and take away my sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not as much as an attack, but he's just trying to get in my way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Jaloh! Great Devil Flicker!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'll knock them all down with a high-speed jab.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't stop just by taking away my sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now I can read the flow of the power of the Espi on the radar....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Iron Magic, Light Magic Emperor Great Railway Sidewalk!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now Slaya activates Magic instead of Espi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then a lump of iron suddenly appeared and stretched from his feet, and it became like an iron sidewalk passing through the forest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufufu, if oniisan has found all the routes, I'll just have to make a new road with my hands!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Find the shortest route to follow after understanding all the surroundings, and use your unique magic to create a new path for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He'll do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't believe you're pulling me out like this again....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kuhahaha, don't do it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As with the espi earlier, it's time to start predicting again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I climbed the iron sidewalk to follow Espi and Slaya once again....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, oniisan.It's going to collapse soon. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh? Wow, wow!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I started climbing the sidewalk, a crack suddenly broke into the sidewalk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sidewalk looks solid, but suddenly thin and brittle like glass... can't you even adjust it like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But in that case, neither you nor Espi....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But wouldn't this drop the Espi and Slaya that were running on the sidewalk?I thought you were floating with the superpowers of Espi...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Phew!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Espi did not help Slayer as he fell and flew in a different direction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as it stands, Slaya...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Iron Making, Tenmoto Ruyi Bar!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Prior to falling, Slayer embodied a long iron rod, stabbing it diagonally against the ground, and the stabbed rod stretched further through Slayer's magic, leaving Slayer far ahead across the forest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nah, ah, those guys!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Distracting attention by disrupting children's expectations, confusing them, and showing their abilities, and then setting a trap and stopping them before separating from each other... they're being taunted ~, children ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, they did it... they made a fool of me ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Absolutely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looks like I'm totally playing with their palms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that how they're getting stronger?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's better than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that's not true, kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Trayna denied my feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Sure, it's getting stronger... but I don't even say it's getting overwhelmingly stronger than a kid.By then, my child, your current level is quite high. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If we fought with the intention of defeating them properly, this would not be the case... but if we were to be 'run' only on that level, it would be a different story."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's stronger, but it's not overwhelmingly stronger than me, as Trainer thinks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in reality I'm being manipulated by them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what does it mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Look, it's not like you're bluffing.If we don't run, we'll lose him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, that's right!It's so far away... damn it, hurry up and chase me. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was stuck and confused, they seemed to be going a long way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we get any further away, we'll lose Traina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then we have to close the distance a little.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well... then... what do you do next..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Breakthrough!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breakthrough--
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there's only one breakthrough.But at this distance... they can't reach... and they just... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what Traina whispered to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Here we are, Slaya!Wow, I've been watching your game through the Magic Crystal, but I'm still watching it live... uhh, I miss it!Tears are coming out!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah... the light of oniisan's soul... and from here on, Espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I know!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It was about 90 seconds in the game before you... but it lasted about three minutes when we knew it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you run out of those three to four minutes, you'll catch your breath, so concentrate!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Of course!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I broke through, Slaya and Espi, far away, looked as happy as if they had sparkled their eyes, but immediately had a belligerent smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kids, those two are never licking you for a fool.I'm not playing.I suppose it was because I was serious that I was taking your measures.Your eyesight, radar, foresight, speed, breakthroughs.Everything is to admit ourselves to the reunion, to get a bubble of praise..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think I'm supposed to use breakthroughs here, too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those guys, think so much.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And you've been almost anonymous so far... so... I've never fought without sparring with anyone who knows you."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dozen years ago, I burned it in my eyes, in my brain, in my heart.Your running, your playfulness, your battle against Noja, your battle against Aony, your battle against Gouda... ever since I was a little girl... and I thought about it many times, and I celebrated this day on top of it. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, yes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those two kept looking at me from the moment they met until the day of their farewell, and they kept thinking about me until today....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
