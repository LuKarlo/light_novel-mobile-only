<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn, no... far away!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can narrow the distance between the two of you running forward... but if you don't breathe in before it arrives, you'll break through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The result is that one breath will not reach another step after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufufu, I'm sorry, oniisan â™ª"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Playing with Slayers in the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya smiled at the line that seemed to give back to me at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the second time ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi is also Niyaniya.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The speed and distance of the forward running Slayer and Espi are not critical to my breakthrough speed and duration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I'm sure that's how it's going to be adjusted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn it... hah, hah..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I repeated the dash with all my strength and breathed a little bit more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of which, it was a cocktail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina said before she learned to breathe magically.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --If you can do this, "as long as your health lasts", you will no longer be able to use magic due to lack of magic.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You said "as long as your health lasts."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's what it was like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, only magic can heal with magic breathing.I'm not recovering from physical strength or fatigue. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run with all your might for the duration of the Breakthrough.If I don't catch up, I'll breathe the magic again and chase you with a breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the second dash is slower than the first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course. I'm tired.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Children have improved their mental strength and concentration through previous training.It is important in protracted warfare.But most importantly... 'Stamina'.Today's children don't have stamina that can move three days and three nights. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stamina. It's an essential element in battle and everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's all I ran in the cocktail.... you haven't done it lately...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "On the other hand, both Espi and Slaya will have extensive experience in long-lasting battles in warfare and hunter activities.A war pro and a hunter pro... it's hard to get out of here if they point their weaknesses at it. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Chih... I'm already in that place..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And the moment I realize it, I get tired, I get mental fatigue, I get disturbed in my concentration."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Exactly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel like I'm losing focus gradually and I'm losing track of the magical shining road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Traina, do you have any magic to recover from fatigue?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There's nothing wrong with it.Rather than recovering from fatigue, it's magic that doesn't make you feel tired... but if you can remember that, you'll learn to strengthen your stamina by thinking about the future. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Does that make it easy to learn?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't wear it.The stack of authentic days brings us closer to unbeatable physical and mental strength.It's not something you'll get in the last few days. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So you're saying I can't catch them now, just because they're a protracted battle?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I knew it wouldn't be easy for them to train for 15 years and plan for today's tricks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why I surrendered so easily. It's too pathetic."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's right. That's why you should try eating it.Take the time to think, be aware of the pace distribution, and how to put them behind it..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's just getting started.We have a few days till the goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if we find out how hard they've been working, I'll have to tell them I'm a boulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beyond you yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shinobi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breakthrough duration, health, and recovery are not easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What can you do with it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Take a deep breath and calm down into the zone....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fluffy Sandstorm!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm, oniichan won't concentrate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I try to calm down, the escaped Espi will come back!Sand in your eyes!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a cunning imitation... but what's so blind?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My concentration and magical radar aren't as disturbing as that....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Speaking of which, oniichan!When I stopped by the cocktail, I heard that it was flickering ~ "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, I only know the names of Sadis, Fiancay, and Japone's Shinobi girl, but Kuron?Who do you like best? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fuaah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh...? Espi?What are you...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, I heard it from Espi, and I was wondering!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only Espi, but even Slaya, who was far away, came back and did such a thing to me....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I think oniisan can't help but love women, but oniisan's choice of women is no other HR for us, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really? Because for us, oneechan?Yeah, because they're all younger?Either way, we're gonna be a family, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So far, are there four possible daughter-in-law candidates for oniisan?Is he gone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If oniichan chose someone from his heart, we'll congratulate him and convince him, but if he's a nasty child, he won't like it ~"For example... do you like kids with big tits?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan is in puberty...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I thought oniichan was going to marry Thaddeus, but it's getting bigger ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey, what are these guys doing?I know you know about Sadis and Fianssey, but about Sinov and Kuron?No, no, I don't care about tits that are big or small, no, that's it... but Kuron doesn't have any synovs... so my sister and brother suddenly shook the coivana...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fubiya?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly feet?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I couldn't open my eyes due to the sandstorm, and suddenly I was tempered by the coivana, and my feet fell off and fell into something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pitfalls?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu. You have to concentrate.Oniisan "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yikes, oniichan got caught ~"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah... ah... those guys!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, you guys!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahahaha, oniisan's angry.I have to run away. â™ª "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nooooo, niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, wait, wait, wait!I'm gonna punch your ass!Breakthrough!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're making fun of oniichan... I'll definitely catch you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufufufu... that's a total handball..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
