 “Well, are you ready, young lions? I Lingaun, the Imperial Knight, shall be the judge today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was secretly thinking about my plan, a warrior who would be the referee of the match finally appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is a big man with strong features, very famous as an Advanced Warrior who survived the past war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Today, you represent all the Academy students to show off to His Majesty and the people the birth of a new warrior. Don’t fight just for yourselves. Put your heart out and look at the faces of every person gathered here today. Those are the people you are to protect in the future.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lingaun gathers us with powerful words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With those words, others who were nervous had a change in their eyes that said, ‘I’ll do it’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you very much for attending the Imperial Warrior Academy [Graduation Commemorative Match]!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At last, the host of the event started the ceremony.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, I, the princess, Rebal, and Fu braced ourselves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With this, I would like to commence the match with 16 selected Academy students! Please watch to the end!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uooooooooooooooooooh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thousands? No, ten thousand? The cheers so loud you feel such vigor like the roar of subterranean tremor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “First, we will have a lottery by the selected students! Selected students, enter!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Woooooooooooooooooo!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess Phianseeeeee!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Rival! Kyaah! Aah, He’s cool~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuey~, Fu, do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following Lingaun, we also step into the Arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The spread was a spacious square surrounded by walls on all sides.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Every seat on the wall was filled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore, at the guest seats …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, here they are. The Next Generation”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Emperor watches over us with a gentle smile on his face. Next to him is the Empress, the princess’s mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And beside them……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Earth, looking good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku~, I really wanted to loudly cheer for Earth with Sadiz in the audience~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Standing close to the emperor and empress as escorts, father and mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “♫ Go Go Little man, Go! Lil’ Earth! Go! ♫“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the audience seats, I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There, Sadiz, wearing a short skirt with blue sleeveless top, waved a ball-like tool called ‘Ponpon’ in both hands, and cheered for me with legs and hands raised up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good…… Erotic-cute… [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Miss Sadiz~, same as ever.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… As usual, overprotective of Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mmm, h-hey, Earth. Stop staring so hard at Sadiz’s legs and skirt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The figure of Sadiz, who is also familiar to Fu and Rebal, made both of them blush slightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only the princess is showing a disgusted expression, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, 16 selected students gathered here will demonstrate their strength in front of you today. The duels allow use of weapons and magic according to the rules. And from now on, each and every one of them will draw lots and decide on the matchups.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the host’s words, Lingaun presents a square box to us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, pull the lottery one at a time and read the number aloud.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A blank tournament table was prepared further above the audience seat on a giant billboard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are they going to read each person’s number and write it over there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We could have drawn lots beforehand, but it’s more exciting to do it in front of everyone, so this is how it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, I’ll have you draw lots in order. First, Phianse Depaltia!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Starting with the princess. She put her hand in the box that Lingaun holds and takes out a round ball from inside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a number No. 10 written on it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse Depaltia, number 10! The first round of the fifth match.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next! Gellipy Yuli!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! …… Yes! Number 15!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Places on the tournament table get filled one after another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next, Fu Meday!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! …… Oh, yes, yes! It’s number 12.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next!” Coman Paiper!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, yes… Well, that… It’s number 6.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And thus, things progressed as it us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next! Rebal Janyne!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””Kitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Mr. Rebal!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal, the most likely champion and the leading hero candidate of the next generation!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s not a rookie anymore!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s already talk of the advanced warrior class. No doubt, the strongest man of the generation!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, Rebal is very popular.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having been away from the empire for a year, everyone is excited to quickly see his growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal… I see. Seems confident he’ll run for Phianse’s candidate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… good attitude.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. Maybe he’s not entirely at the academy level anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, the emperor, father, and mother have an eye-opening impression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then Rebal draws a lottery…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… Number two.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal Janyne, Number 2! It will be the first match of the first round!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””So sudden! Rebal Kitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal drew the No.02 ball and got the first match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Rebal is the first match of the first round.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Next, Earth Lagann!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, the second generation of the Great Hero, Hiro has come!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He might be inferior to his father and mother, but he’s also talented.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Will he be the dark horse this time?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My name is called, but far from cheers Rebal received.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder. My talent and so on, has been known in the Imperial city for a long time! Right now they don’t expect much from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, it elevates the genius of the Princess, Rebal, and Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, h-hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From now on, I’ll change all of that evaluation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that determination, I will carry out what I had planned with Tre’ainar in advance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I take the box of the lottery box from the Lingaun, turn it over, and scatter the raffle balls on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!? Li-ttle ma!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you doing, hey!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He tossed the lottery!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, my sudden actions startled everyone, including the audience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t care, I pick a number up from the raffles that fell to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… that was. Wo wo wo, Earth Lagann! …… Number one! First round match, against Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””””Eh!!!???””””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sent my declaration of war to Rebal and to all of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th… That idiot…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… th-the ball… I’m getting lightheaded…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone is out of their minds over what I’ve done. Sadiz has her mouth wide open, so do my father and mother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the first time I’ve seen these three people react like that, and I feel somewhat fresh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And after a while of silence……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””What is he doiiiiiiing!!!??? “””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone shouted the same words all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, he turned over the lottery and picked up the number!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-That’s what it is!? That’s not fair! As the son of a great hero, what is he thinking?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, b-but… So, does that mean he chose Rebal as his opponent?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way! That Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But is that a sudden confrontation between children of the heroes in the first round?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, they can’t allow this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Disapproval. Bewilderment. And, the reactions to the confrontation between the children of the heroes suddenly being set in the first match of the first round arise all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although I have no idea what’s about to happen, but for now, I showed Rebal that this was my response.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh… Earth…… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe… This is my answer, Rebal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m here to prove myself, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal seems quite surprised, but on the other hand, as the situation became clear he seemed fired up with blazing passion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Okay! I accept your challenge!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal is motivated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Wh-What… you shouldn’t have…… ♡”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, Earth… Wha-, princess?! You got heart eyes… Eh, princess-like manner, that’s the reason, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, the princess and Fu are making noise, but it doesn’t matter now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooooh, Rebal accepted!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, suddenly from the first round!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m seeing things in a new light, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the crowd also cheers in response to Rebal’s acceptance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, y-you boys, you don’t have permission! This is a lottery… Yes, that is how…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, a violation of the rules is a violation of the rules.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Lingaun also tries to get us to start over. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal Janyne!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the Emperor who was in the guest seat stood up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the emperor began to speak, the audience who were still noisy calmed down all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as the air swells in an instant, the emperor asks Rebal with a stern expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is a clear violation of the rules. But you said, ‘I accept’. You don’t mind that, do you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the emperor’s question, Rebal got on one knee and bows.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your Majesty. I will win this tournament. Meaning I won’t lose no matter who is in it. Therefore, having matchups by lottery is meaningless! I will fight with anyone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A powerful declaration. The emperor raises his hand and yells out ‘if he says so’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, the first match of the first round sees Earth Lagann and Rebal Janyne. These two will face each other!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Uooooooooooh!!!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the direct decision of the emperor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that happens, the rules are irrelevant. No one can overturn it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the most excited cheers of today were raised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meanwhile, father, mother, and Sadiz, being totally speechless, simply laughed half-heartedly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] For a frame of reference… [here] , [here] , [here] and [here]! Your Welcome!
