<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I couldn't catch him for a day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, oniichan!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Let's eat a lot of curry today."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the sun set, Espi and Slaya sat in front of me in the middle of the plain and waited for me, "Today is the day.The match is tomorrow again. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now we're going to have dinner in a pause and camp here in preparation for tomorrow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn it... you really did it... you guys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uhh?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I said that while receiving the curry on the plate, they suddenly wobbled their eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, what is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah... oniichan praised me..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fu, fufu, oniisan, we're still not like that.More! I can surprise oniisan even more... and help him more... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you impressed or smelly, but you two look happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't believe you moved me so far with this one word of mine... but once again I realized how strong they were, and I kind of smelled it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But you're worried, Slaya."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah, I'm sure you're worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What happened?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan, is this the time to grow up?That's why oniichan's getting harder now, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, oniisan's even stronger than now... that's too strong..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though I wonder what you're serious about, your face gets hot.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's why oniichan's getting hotter now, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, that's tough.Oniisan is so strong and cool, so why don't you let a bad woman approach and tease oniisan... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, we have to protect oniichan from the bad women approaching him."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I thought during the day... well, look, these guys aren't old enough anymore... but for me, they're my sister and brother...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, let's continue with the daytime conversation, who's your best candidate for daughter-in-law so far?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, we need to get this right."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So stop it!Shame on you! It's embarrassing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't help but be ashamed of them and Coybana.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I'm not just being attacked here, and I have to fight back....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's right!If you say so, then Espy and Slaya are dating, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Nh... well, that's right..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Which way did you... confess?Did you have a date or something? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, they're dating, and I haven't heard anything about them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Listening to this root digging and leaf digging, both of you turned red.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... confess... what if you notice something?Somehow?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, I guess so.I don't know what else to say... but what do you want to hear?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……………………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What the hell?Is this clammy twist or a car?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, wait!Well, you, Slaya and Espi are both my brother and sister, and there was something like this, there was something like this ~, there was something like that, there was an event ~, I wonder if you need a report like that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Events... even if they say... what kind of events?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm, what kind of face... even if you look like that... eh?Are these guys dating?No, a mature couple? More catchy, ugly, sweet and lewd Coybana... events?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if it's an event between lovers....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, this is the first time... fu, the two of you... are holding hands... when ~...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "" Hmm!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kh, I'm embarrassed to say that!My face is hot and messy. Why am I so embarrassed to hear about my sister and my brother Koibana?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does what you did with me look like you were jerking off?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniisan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espi and Slayer stood up simultaneously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I breathe with something that creates a strange quiet, the next moment, the two of you....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oniichan... is that... cute... what is this!?Oniichan, you're so cute! Cute!Oniichan's face is bright red, and I'm moaning... "When did you put your hands together?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "How strong and cool... how cute... how cool and cute are our brothers!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so excited that I turned around.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan, I already want to rub oniichan!I got my knee pillow yesterday, so today I want to make oniichan nadenade!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, it's sloppy, Espi!I want to adore oniisan as my brother too!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, don't make fun of me anymore!You guys were talking about my permission to get married!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't need permission to marry anymore. Oniichan is a little bit... I see, just after I find oniichan's wife."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, we're faster than oniisan..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ma'am! I'm still oniichan's sister, and I'm still sweet!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I still have to stay with oniisan."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, the two of you who had spoiled me, now they're beating me up and messing with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was so pathetic and embarrassed that she was laughing at Treina.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it... I can't believe the day will come when Espi and Slaya will coincide and I'll be loved the other way around...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But oniichan...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at that time... while the Espi hugged me, it seemed a little serious...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "If you already have a girl you like... and you can't think about other girls... you can't show other girls how cool they are anymore... you can't show them where you're going to like a girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What about it?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And not just Espi, but Slaya....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, that's right... for example... well... aren't you going to meet a lot of people on your next journey?Well, that's what I'm going to do... even though I wasn't in the village of elves I'm going to go to more than a decade ago, I was born after that and I'm about the same age as oniisan... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... ah... is that so?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't know what to say, but they're laughing at me... what are you trying to tell me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, if oniichan's going to meet and fall in love with a girl, oniichan is going to love and tie it up, then you have to support her at all.Is that true? But, um... if you're not chosen, the girl won't cry... that's not true... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, well... we also think that's pathetic... so, oniisan.If we're dealing with a girl who doesn't want to, I think we should try not to fall in love with a girl because she's too cool. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… …… ……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know exactly what they were worried about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Doesn't that feel like some kind of hottie that makes me fall in love with women one after another?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I don't have to do that... I've never had a girlfriend before... No, there was Thaddeus, fiancée was in the way... well, confess to Kron and Sinov... but don't worry about that, right?It's not like there's a fan club like Rival or Hu... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-huh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don't know what you two are worried about, but that's not often, and you don't have to worry about anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
