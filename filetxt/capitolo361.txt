 "We also had some information about Cacletail and Yamidiré from Noja and through the Betrail before the Espi was insulated... but we didn't know about Kron..."

 "Huh? Was it?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah. There were rumors that the cockroach tail was involved with the bokumates... the postcard.But that's why I can't actively interfere... that's what they do. "

 "... I see..."

 "Hmm? But now that we're talking... that clone... isn't a human being but a demon?Does that mean oniichan... has absolutely nothing to do with romantic relationships?

 "Oh, is that what this is about?

 Coibana with her sister and brother was embarrassed and agonized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Especially, it's twice as embarrassing that you're going to love me from both sides.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, I wondered what they were doing because they were thriving in such coivanas.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What are Sadis and Fiancay doing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you go back to the Empire with Rival and Hugh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did you join your father or your mother?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What about Sinov?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if the Thadis return to the Empire, there is no reason for Sinov to go to the Empire.

 And if you think about it, the elf settlement we're headed for is in Japone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, is that Nukenin?I mean, did you ever jump out of the country and become a hunter with your brother and friends in the first place, and you never see each other again in Japone?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How's Kuron doing?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yamidiré travels the world with Bro and Hilua.

 Where are you and what are you doing right now?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm?

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of clones... no... 'back then'...

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only breakthroughs, zones and radars, but if you're in that state, you'll be playing a little more...

 "Slaya, what do you think?What about your brother today? "

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're after something, aren't you?It's not gum shark like yesterday. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like yesterday, I'm playing tricks today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Espy and Slayer escaping away from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've looked back many times and checked my position, but today I look back more than yesterday.

 You seem to be worried about me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, you seem curious.Well, I guess you don't know. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess. All they know about you is what they showed you in the past.And the degree of battle in the game you were peeking at.You don't know anything about me. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna thinks they don't know what I'm after.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I'm trying to do something different than yesterday.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You're not riding on provocation...."

 He's just chasing us in front of him.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's just a run.I don't feel like I'm gonna catch us. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What I'm trying to do right now is prepare to catch them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Enduring battle... I didn't mean to try to play sole on that theme... well, try everything.It's also a necessary element later. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trainer won't tell you if this is the right answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let me think for myself and push my back to try it on.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Even without Kron's power... on his own..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered last night when I had a conversation about Kron in Koibana.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 --Earth, you can do anything!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I fought Basara, the Dragon King of Underworld.Kuron told me that.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By having the unwavering confidence that I could do it, I was able to do more than usual.

 Together with the motivation to be pulled up, it eventually turns fatigue and suffering into pleasure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "To Magical Runners High!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if we can reach that place on our own, without having to rely on Kron or use magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you don't get tired, you can surprise those two a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, instead of catching Espi and Slaya, I was trying to push myself anyway with the idea of even running in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though they've been coybanned, each of them is now under a distant sky.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's better to raise yourself now than to worry about Koibana.
