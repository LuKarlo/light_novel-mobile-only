<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I should be able to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think back to what Kuron said to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the power of the dawn eye might have certainly been present.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there was certainly the power of words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Repeat the words in your heart over and over, murmuring them with your mouth and over and over again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Things I think I can do. Thinking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Making the brain, the body, and even the cells think so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I can! I can! I can!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was running into the cocktail.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was draining water to learn to breathe magically.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I pushed my body and spirit to the extreme, and looked at death and went mad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I put up with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then what happened?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I beat Mr. Macho.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I made him roar at Rosala.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fighting the Sky King, the Rokkai and the Demon King army.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "That's all I've ever... fought!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How long did it take to repeat it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How many hours, more yesterday?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But anyway.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... it's me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After a long run, it may have taken some time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this feeling....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What's up, boy... you're feeling better now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nowadays, zones of extreme concentration can be made of their own volition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feeling at that time was like "in."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking so, the current state is slightly different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's coming up....."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You must have been tired, but you're getting better and better.Excited? I even feel fun and feel like I can do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike "going in" in the zone, it's like "going up."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Without Kuron's eyes, let the brain secrete drugs... to the limit."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even for Espi and Slaya, who are running without rest while maintaining a distance so that they won't lose sight of me in the front, it will be time for them to remain unconscious without knowing what will happen, so they may be a little mentally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for me, as Trayna says, this is the place to start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Mm... Espi..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yes, oniichan's air has changed somehow."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're up to something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Finally. I've been running for hours and hours since yesterday...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Slaya and Espi felt my air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can see that the vigilance is rising further from the atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Since yesterday.They won't tell me anything at dinner... and I'm not being burned by people who can't catch me no matter how much I run... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I suppose you've been making it since yesterday... just like Curry makes it taste better the longer you cook it ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Exactly. Looks like Oniisan has been a little different since he defeated Gouda in just a few days."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, I mean... will it get cooler again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I wonder.Now... can I see it?Oniisan "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "By surpassing your brother, you can prove us to him!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slaya and Espi are waiting for me to do something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Come on, big brothers!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever I was up to, I should've gone so far as not to see me yesterday or today, if I could just beat this trick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what I don't want to do is focus on how to win against me because they're a match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can't just throw yourself out until you're blind and win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I can't catch anything, I dare to wait for me to do something to show my strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I was able to get it right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, kid. Even if we break through here, there's still a distance.Even if you are connected with magic breathing, the ability of the espionage will interfere with the gap that becomes defenseless in that breathing.Now, what do we do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It doesn't matter. Non-stop, fast chase to the end of the earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, eat it up.That's fine now.The tunnel is also one correct answer. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we catch him, we'll have to catch him between breakthroughs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now I can't catch you dashing through a breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Anyway, this is all I can do right now.I can't fly like an espi, and I can't fly all at once..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I don't have a backstroke right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I was supposed to run to the tunnel, run around and catch up...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bububububu..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical Runner's High made me think that I could do anything right now. I was going to run in the tunnel, but I thought of something else in my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's the only way I can beat them in an instant....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whoa
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next Trainer reacted happily to what I had in mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fuhahaha, is that it?Isn't it interesting to think of something, child? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... what do you think?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Absolutely... Stamina was the challenge of this training... but with the magical runners high I've reached for it, I've come up with something unexpected... that's good!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The greatest and most powerful trick I can play against my enemies is the Great Demon Spiral at all times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes you can hit it, or you can blow it off with that shock wave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why I put so much effort into flying the opponent everywhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what happens if I blow myself up with that power?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina nodded at my thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uh-oh, big demon helix!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Show them how happy they are.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Finally...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, yeah! Oniichan's synonym... I saw your match through the magic crystal..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "After all, when I look straight at it like this...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're gonna cry ♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The expression looks like it's nostalgic and slightly moist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This power is memorable to them too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, what do we do?No way! Attack? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I don't think we're going to attack, so I guess it's a good idea to destroy the road ahead of us and stop passing...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that's the case, it's fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, there's already a way to deal with that."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't attack them with this move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That's why they expect me to sabotage them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They're saying, "That kind of sticky usage doesn't work."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, it's not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what I'm going to do now is to use it in a way that I've never done before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So rest assured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don't do stuffy things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "One point advice, kid.It's not a simple helix... let's change the shape of the helix a little bit. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Trainer whipped me in the ear as I tried to fly in the shock waves of the Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon Spiral is just one end of the magic manipulation, and it's not the final form.I only manipulated magic to create a spiral shape.Then it can be made in other ways!That is, you can make anything depending on the situation!With a fiercely spinning vortex... imagine a feather like a windmill!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Feathers?"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now you can also 'change the form' of the Great Demon Spiral!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trayna gave me a more trustworthy word, "I can do it now."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I'll do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, the Great Demon Spiral was also consciously shaped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Over and over again, it can now be unconscious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, the origin regression. Shaping what I imagined....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nh... what!?Oniisan's helix.... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is that? Windmill!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time, they saw the shape of my new Great Demon Spiral.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until yesterday, they were surprised at my different powers.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufufu, I miss it. Flight magic is now available, and I no longer use such fancy moves, but a long time ago... after wanting to fly freely in the sky, I ran through the sky... a fusion of helicopters and wings!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina also seems to miss it, and it looks like she's having some fun....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fly free in the sky!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Shinobi! The Great Demon Helicopter!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The explosive power of the Great Demon Spiral and the vortex of rotation, as well as the resulting wings, propel it forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fly with the momentum of a cannon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm...?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nnh...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, my eyes!?Yes, hah, hah!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn't "flying" anymore, it was "flying."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With so much speed and momentum, I couldn't even open my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Uahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!????
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, oniisan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ahhhhh, oniichan?!No, what is this!?Ha, ha, oniichan!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I found out that I could hear the voice of Espi and Slaya in front of me from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, instead of catching up with the two of them in the moment, I've left them behind....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that's good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, no, Traina, what do we do with this?!No, deactivate!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wait, if you release it immediately, it will be thrown out momentum or fall to the ground as it is.If it stops, it slows down slowly. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Can I say that!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I couldn't control myself, so I went a long way on a high-speed flight....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, oniisan's gone!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "We have to hurry after them... Luckily, they're heading to their destination, but they're not going to stop!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I'm going to crash into the mountains like this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Onii-chan, I'm going now!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can't even hear my sister and brother screaming and chasing me from behind.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Go to the wooded mountains beyond.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufu, I found it!"Pie Tree Fruit" and sweet ripening ♪ I have to bring it home and make sweets quickly!Apple pie and lemon pie are also good, but this time of year, pie is the most delicious ♪ My brother and sister said that they will bring important customers to visit soon, and I need to treat my prized pie!... ah, I have to leave right away.If your father finds out, he'll be mad at you for getting out of the line again.Recently, people have occasionally stepped into this mountain without permission..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was flying in a mountain in my direction....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? I cum, what a wind?!What? Something's... something's flying... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hadn't even noticed a fairy was candling.
