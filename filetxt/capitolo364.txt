<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Amix.What about you? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Earth. That's my name.Nice to meet you. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, nice to meet you.Earth! "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The happiness I've done, the hostility I've been directed against, and the pure nickel smile on my face, an elf named Amix.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I've been watching my vigilance diminish.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Are you quite young?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm? Ah, fifteen..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No! Same as me?Same age!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Oh, really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yeah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix shook his hand up and down with joy.Shake vertically... nothing, be heartless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ... eh? Same age now!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I've never met anyone my age.Neither brother nor sister has anything to do with people the same age, such as the city at the foot of which occasionally goes to Kosushiri..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really... hmm?Sister?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah! I'm a human, but I have a brother and sister who have been playing with me for a long time.So, if you try to do something to me, my very strong brother and sister won't shut up.I'm strong too ♪ "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Elf Girl. They must be the elves of the settlement we were aiming for.Being my age means I was born after the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, "My human brother and sister are so strong..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You mean Slaya and Espi?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm!? Huh? Huh?Why!? How does Earth know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I gave them their names, Amix looked surprised.I knew it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm a family of two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "And today, we were working together on an elf settlement.I played with the two of you on the way, and when I tried my new trick, I got off the hook... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well then, Earth-kun is the most important customer my brother and sister will bring soon!Nah! Huh? Huh?But what do you mean, family?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Haha, well, it's a complicated process... I'll talk to you when we meet."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Wow, wow! That's right, that's right!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Knowing that I was a family of two, Amix smiled reassuringly and pulled my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Well, then, there's no problem.I'll take you to our settlement, Tapir Bael!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Bubba!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, Earth-kun?What's the matter with you? You all right? You all right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No, I'm a little surprised... what kind of name is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was an unexpected and unexpected name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh, ah, yeah... it seems that before I was born, my father lived somewhere else, but when people raided it and couldn't live there, they saved the Elves, and not only that, but they also thanked you in your name for giving me money and giving me new land."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, hee..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that me?No, thank you very much. What's your name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Traina laughed beside her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Kukukukuku... I don't think I can name the settlement Earth Lagan on a boulder..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah... well..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, that money will become your pseudonym....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. But I didn't know that happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know the name of the fake ID that Palippi gave me would be the name of the Elf's settlement...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, brother and sister, and such a generous Tapir Bael are human... so I know that there are bad people and scary people, but I know that everyone is not.That's why Earth-kun looked me in the eye and thought I'd be okay. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I see...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "So, if Earth-kun is a customer, I'll do my best to entertain him ♪"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm the Tapir Bael... but to explain it, I have to explain what I went to in the past, and it's annoying, so I'll just keep quiet for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ufufufu, but Earth-kun touched my body because I had to tell my father, mother, brother and sister that I'd be angry if all four of them found out about it."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Oh, please!Don't tell Slaya or Espi!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Nhh, uhh... uhhh... ♡"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "A, amix?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fufufu ~ Yeah, then I'll shut you up.Instead, be friends with me. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh? Ah, oh, that's fine."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "I did it ♡ I've got more friends!"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Amix grabbed Niginigi's hand with joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'm just so happy to be a friend... anyway, it would have been cheap if you'd just shut up about earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "It's okay if you're a friend.They're all overprotective. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Overprotective?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. As soon as I talked to the boy, I said, "What's his relationship?, Do you like it?I'm going to ask. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hee, it's overprotective...."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix's parents.I don't know who that is, but do you remember me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was only involved with the sheik and wife in that settlement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Really, it's overprotective.All the boys in the settlement think only of themselves as friends and brothers.I have a "type of preference", so if I don't have that type of person, maybe I'll like it... that way, all four of you will face trouble again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh, heh, that's right... even Espi and Slaya..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah, that's right.Ah, does Earth-kun have a girl he likes? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Eh? Eh, ah... suddenly..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I became a friend, all of a sudden it was Koibana.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Espi and Slaya have been cobbling together, are they popular?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix's eyes were so sparkly and fun... the girl I like... I knew when it came to talking about it, I thought of Kuron, Sinov, Sadis and... somehow, he said he liked it... Fi...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My type hasn't changed since I was a kid."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Hmm?But... all the boys in the settlement are friends... hmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Yeah... that's right"
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked a simple question, Amix smiled bitterly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "You know, I'm supposed to be saying, 'These boys are good', and that's not who I am... but I'm not real anymore..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Is it real? What do you got there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn't know what you were talking about.But it looks like something important is happening, and Amix's face doesn't seem like a joke....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Kids!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh? Huh? Hey, Earth-kun, huh?Hey, where's the touch, eh, eh!What... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sudden signs of feeling. In Trayna's words, I reacted instantly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Holding Amix, I jumped out of the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then there were a few arrows stuck in the ground where we were standing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh. Avoid what I just saw... you're a pretty naive kid."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, there was a middle-aged man with a bow and arrow on top of a forest tree and a loud smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What? Who is it?Earth..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... these guys..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While holding Amix with an anxious face, I was with a man who showed up....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "There are three more."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Grasp the surrounding situation with the radar.There are others in the woods, hiding behind the trees, targeting us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, did you notice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I say so, the guy with the bow and arrow laughs as impressed, and....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You're not just a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I'll do it, boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "But luck runs out with us."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A pair of middle-aged Osan quartets equipped with swords, spears and hammers that don't seem so stubborn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The purpose is.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Brother, if you want your life, send that elf daughter to us!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And amix trembled in my arms.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, you guys!Nobody's been wandering around this mountain lately!Go home, or I'll make it sweet!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix stares at you in disgust.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Osan and the others laughed rather happily at the glance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "With such a superb body, you can shout well!It must be delicious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Fuck me! Hey, don't sell him. Let's make him ours, okay?Right? "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bye. We don't eat until we make them vomit about the settlement. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix trembled with a shivering face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To scumbags rattling with a disgusting smile while drooling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Damn it, it's called Auga, it's you, don't bother the fairies who live in peace.With people like you, both humans and augers will lose their reputation. "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Same as in the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "What is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ground... huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King Army's Orga Troops... and today they...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hey, kid. Say it again?If I send my daughter, my life will be... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "No kidding. He's like the one my family cares about.And above all... a new friend of mine.What's wrong with risking your life?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Huh, Nii?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I don't know what to do.These guys look like hunters, and I can take Amix with me, but if they're wandering around looking for a settlement, they're gonna have to go home with a little pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ah, um, Earth-kun... um..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Don't say anything, amix."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Rest assured. I'll finish it right away."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "... uh... ah... ahh..."
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I smiled to reassure Amix that she was trembling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, following my words, Amix fell in love with Pocahontas.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Ha! You're such a pussy!This place is in the mountains, and the bodies won't be buried around it... so I won't forgive you!We'll remind you of the power of a professional hunter!I'll give you our name as a souvenir of the underworld!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A professional hunter. That's what the Others shouted.....
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Coino!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Cupid!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Temple!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "My name is Yvent!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One after the other, they attacked us all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It's quite a controlled movement with no square clearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Hmm... well, don't be alarmed, kid.They're professionals, after all.Even so..... "
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Traina's advice. I can't be sure to be alarmed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Amix is here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, surround it in all directions and attack it simultaneously... well, that's good...
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 "Then I'll finish it with one shot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don't be alarmed, and I'll finish it in an instant, as promised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
