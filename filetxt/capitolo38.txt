 This chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By a sheet of paper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By a piece of cloth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By a skin’s depth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how close the attacks come to hitting at the last minute every time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it never does.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t get hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only do I see everything, but I can also adjust the margin by which I evade them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Earth… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As he swings his sword, Rebal is starting to get confused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, Rebal’s sword may be swift.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if the sword is likened to a long arm, it does not have a joint, so there is no unexpected trajectory along the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By looking at the angle of the shoulder and the arm, even if swung with both hands, you can predict the sword’s trajectory before you see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, I, just now, I think he got grazed!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal is getting even faster!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At this rate, he’ll receive all the blows eventually!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth can’t do anything while defending!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t get grazed. I’m letting you underestimate me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I make sure not even a single scratch on my skin can be identified.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, then… Imperial Sword!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, the same can’t be said for Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He accelerates his attacks and tries to take me down with force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legs, rushing in, everything is stronger and more powerful now, and Rebal is in a serious state of mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Celestial Light Blooming Strident Dance】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, a cutting flash split into multiple layers seemingly at the speed of light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, that Rebal, even that sword!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even among senior swordsmen there are only a few users…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That might kill him!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, the audience would think ‘this is the end’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the moment, I’m not clad in magical power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I fail to avoid a single blow, that’s it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I avoid it… with full spirit!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t you catch me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All strikes, shortest distance, minimum, fastest evasion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The feet move lightly showing the results of the ladder training, and move as smooth as I imagine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The commands sent by the brain reaches to the body at the speed of light and are executed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lightning fast footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… h-hey… Rival fella, how many swords…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu… h-hey, for some time now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wait a minute?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, hey? Mr. Rebal’s sword… it’s quite a while.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha-, hey, that… By any chance…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, the audience seems to have noticed that it is becoming strange gradually though they were chattering away until a while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-Why… Little man this… Those movements…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, you’re even more surprised, Sadiz!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Celestial… the entire sword… Rebal’s swordsmanship is insane. I mean, to see it all… all Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you kidding me? Earth’s reflexes… And, uh… like wings… How do you move your feet?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hiro, di-didn’t you train him!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you watching? Father, Mother, Emperor!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It can’t be… Why?! Rebal’s sword… even the fire dragon got knocked down, Rebal’s sword is… not hitting!? Even though Rebal hasn’t used ‘that power’ yet, what does this mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh. It makes sense if it doesn’t hit you, Fu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dummy… I, even I don’t know… I don’t know this Earth! What is this? What’s going on over there!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Princess, the most amazing thing is that you, who knows the best of my abilities, are so surprised!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, Earth! Oh, how in the world are you ahead!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the moment Rebal asked me, while swinging the sword at the speed of light, trying not to exude uncontrollable bewilderment, I felt it was already over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kukuko, come now… with this dullard… and your dumb, peaceful father and all the heroes, show them.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will prove myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally reached out for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””” Earth’s attack has reached Rebal!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The left, like punching through Rebal’s face diagonally from below. It’s a series of hits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Buha, Gu, Na, Gu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 【Great Demon Flicker Jab】!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Use a snap and swing out from below.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Rebal tried to advance, the moment his posture became slightly lower by stepping forward, I lowered my hips and struck out like a counter from below.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, with a fist that has not yet been strengthened by breakthrough, I punched out Rebal’s nose and jaw, scattering fresh blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh noooo! Rebal’s face is ah ah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, so fast!? What, that punch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why can Earth use such an attack?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal has a sword, why can you punch him so easily?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, you don’t fight bare-handed against someone with a weapon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the unlikely event that you do, you set up a super close-quarters battle to kill your opponent between pauses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, this distance on the left is good enough for me… So I strike!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh… Fast…… Ga Guh…… can’t react!? Gu… Guh…! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is not a one-shot technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal receives my fist, but if he can’t avoid it, he’ll try to forcibly launch an attack while ferociously enduring and venturing forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial sword… Bu, ha, gah”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the moment he tries to use his techniques, I interrupt it with a series of hits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal’s jaw, then nose, bash the ear and at the moment he flinches hit the jaw again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kuku, fuhahahahaha, unable to even activate your skills? The initial motions of the Sword Saint’s Successor are too obvious to the child today.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I won’t allow the opponent to even activate their skills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, I crush the initial motions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With my current eyesight, I picked up on all of Rebal’s initial motions for his techniques and understood them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, I rock my shoulders and feet in small increments, and by swinging my left like a pendulum, I try not to telegraph the initial motions and shoot the left in the movement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A technique for throwing a punch, not increasing the power of the punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, the biggest weapon in a fight is… the left jab, delivered when the left side of the body is facing forward. A weapon that is closest to your opponent and can strike at their head in the shortest possible time. In addition, the flicker’s trajectory, which lowers at the left, seems like a whip and flies diagonally from below, is invisible to him.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Imperial style also has martial arts. However, that mold was discarded completely by the spars with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if you learn impractical kicks and exaggerated punches, it makes no sense if you lack the process necessary to land the hit. In that respect, the left jab is effective in the assembly of attacks, in principle, in all aspects. Also…… by continuously hitting with the left, it becomes…… a weapon sufficiently capable of killing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal’s torso wavers as the activation of his technique is suppressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opening is too enticing, I jump in without patience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And now, on the left, destroy your opponent, strike with the accumulated cannon! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A quick step-in, right fist towards Rebal. No…… Wait.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is Rebal about to snap? He’s going to open up the part of himself he’s hidden within.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood that in advance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, Gah…… tch tch, St…… Stay awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, I can’t end it with just one left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suppose it’s not always so easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, the right is cocked and waiting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Rival roared!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing, it’s like he’s blowing away the surroundings… such Fighting Spirit!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He forced Earth to back away from his range… No way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I was blown off, I took a quick backstep away by myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, I took no damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haa, ha… Earth…… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo. That’s a pretty good look, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, there was a pause in the offensive and defensive battle that began, and there was Rebal, violently short breath and swollen face with blood and bruises, and me who was unscathed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this point, the cheers and the startled voices no longer rise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone is quiet, at a loss for words as if they were looking at something unusual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufu… Alright…… How is this? Hiro. Gradually, your son is tainted. Well, you and I never fought in this fashion, so you would not be aware of my shadow… But what do you think of this child who shows not even a glimpse of your talent, or Mamu’s? Huh-ha-ha! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, perhaps he was in a good mood after what I’ve done so far, Tre’ainar was laughing as he looked up at my parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, no matter how you look at it, it’s a ‘pause’. It’s like an interval.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what do you do when your opponent is still upset?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… is it break time already? Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kick the ground hard, and this time I jump with one step and got into the space in front of Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I didn’t use steps that would confuse the opponent, I flew in a straight line.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From the front… Don’t take me lightly, Earth! It’s certainly hard to catch your left punch and your footwork, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Rebal reacts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here! I got you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He tries to intercept me flying straight at him with a counter, and swings his sword down from the front toward my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I chuckled inward and made a sudden stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the steps trained with the ladder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re about to launch an unavoidable attack, a guy like Rebal won’t choose to ‘retreat’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’ll try to thwart my frontal attack with his sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I’ll bait him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal reacts, his head is wide open as he instinctively commences the attack, his sword is lured in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal totally fell for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn it!? My sword… is swung!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I made him swing his sword at my timing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What if you know in advance when and where your opponent swings their sword?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a state where he swung his sword and missed, Rebal’s face was full of openings… Well, this strategy was taught by Tre’ainar… And this fist, too…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pierce through the limits!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The long-awaited right. A punch that uses the shoulder, elbow, and wrist to push forward like a drill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 【Great Demon CorkScrew Blow】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All this makes me excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, his naming sense is unacceptable, so I’ll have to shout the new name of this skill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is my deadly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Special Move, 【Fang of Heavenly Light • Meteor Flash Spir- uh… Uh, uh… Do iiiiiiiiittt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Darn! I did it, I fumbled the technique name aaaaaaaaaahh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gahd Dammiiiiiiiittt!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The long awaited, debut of my 【Fang of Heavenly Light • Meteor Flash Screwattack】! [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hey…… cur, how dare you even consider this motion? The extent of such pathetic naming sense…… Did you conceive the moniker knowing you will regret ever uttering it in a year or two? Light? Flash? You basically used the same thing twice? Is it that important? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like that, Tre’ainar whispers out to me in a very cold, rather unusual way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no matter how you think about it, I have a better naming sense, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, for now, I punched Rebal through the temple and he rolled down to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s not going to be a knockout, Rebal is here to show his true self. But now I’d be more ashamed of having eaten such a deathblow!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, the overall rating exceeds 40,000 points… I wonder, it’s a bad thing when the author mentions the point, right? I hear that you disliked it, so I will start over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, the overall rating has exceeded 40,000 drills! Thank you for your spiral power. Or, after all, I was completely naked all week. When I saw it just now, the ranking of the day was also one digit, and I was grateful. Activate the quick attack magic ‘Post’!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’re one step closer to our goal of one million drills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Oh my God! It’s Spreading!!!
