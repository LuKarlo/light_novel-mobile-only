<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis a very valuable experience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have led many in the past, but never have I raised anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis not bad, this feeling as the student fully demonstrates their results and growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth’s Fist caught Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Mr. Rebal!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal fell… now, he’s face down on the floor!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “P-Powerful… Earth, so strong!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going on…a genius like Rebal can’t be left helpless on his hands and knees, right!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, with the crowd’s narrow-minded notion of ‘knowing his nature’ when it came to the child, their subsequent surprised reaction had me burst into laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I can’t believe it… that Earth, where did you learn that? When did you learn that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With Hiro… me and… much less, it’s different from Sadiz. How the heck did he…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than anything, the fact that you are incapable of masking your surprise proves my superiority.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Say? Hiro. Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You do not understand, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happened to your son and why he gained so much power!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything is too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite the fact that I was completely destroyed by you and become but a spirit, this in a way, still verifies my existence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And yet…… tis ironic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I uttered so, I recall a little of the past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once, when he was close in age to the child of today, it was during one of our battles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Bonds of companions who can believe each other - -
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The mere recollection of such a curious remark is vexing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was frustrated by the dreams of a spoiled child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I must admit that in any form I was defeated still.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After losing, no matter my denial of his words now, I am sour.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -We humans cannot lose! And, we can never overcome the racial wall with the demons!-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, come to think of it, you said that as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, tis been more than ten years since then, what happened?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the world you gained after defeating me, were you able to realize the sweet jest of the past?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no way to know the answer beyond now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As such, it may be decided with the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, your son… Hiro…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh… Even so, this is also something… You and I have faced each other on many occasions, but… Now we do not fight each other, we simply do the same thing… I am watching over the same man. And you , who should know your own son better than anyone else, know nothing, and now I know your son better…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, I looked up at that man in the guest sitting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He can neither see me, nor can he hear me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As such, no matter how much I muttered to myself, unless the child is there to hear it, it matters not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I still inadvertently uttered it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The son of my former nemesis who I guided on a whim.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The post-war world… I know nothing of the state of this world right now. At least your family does not seem to be faring very well. Rebellion… tis a little difficult to get rid of such with mere words, as you can tell if you look at your son.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although he was of my nemesis’ lineage, nevertheless he was permanently connected with the seal that held me and my obsession.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We now share a peculiar relationship, although tis like playing master and pupil, killing time after over ten years was more than enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the beginning, I stopped the child from fighting in a style reminiscent of Hiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only because I did not care for it, but I also decided it did not suit the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I put it into words and said it directly to the child, I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When this 15-year-old boy heard, ‘I don’t have the same talent as my father’, he in turn says to me,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -I-it’s not… Somehow, I have a rather pleasant feeling about this! Not like I’m my father’s son……exactly, more like I’m myself! I feel like a curse upon me has been reduced a little bit, and it made me feel better-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said so in earnest, not in his own way, to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -Please, Tre’ainar. Lead me to the right path-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child would not have noticed it either. At that time, the moment I heard those words, my astonishment was such that my face almost fell out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you understand? Hiro. People do not easily discard what they have accumulated or have been aiming for. If you put in the effort, pushed forward, and spent all that time on it, you would like to believe that it was not all for naught. To throw it away just by being told such by a person is, in a sense, a denial of the past self.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, so I made the proposal myself, and informed the child, ‘I don’t have the same talent as my father’, I assumed the child would disagree and turn rebellious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he did not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You abandoned your son, did you not? Whatever words may come from your mouth, your focus up to this point, is always rooted to your dream and style. Rather that, I believe that it alleviates the burden… Do you know what that means? Hiro!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you were the child, you would realize how little time you and your parents have spent with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I consider your attitude toward your son, perhaps there was a desire similar to that of ‘parents and children being connected by their hearts’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such could be said as the child’s fighting style was still ‘the same magic sword as his father’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child has forsaken all that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the end of the day, he will not aim to be an Imperial Knight like you. He refuses to follow the path you have taken or the future you have prepared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Hiro. Mamu. What have you left to your son?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Being so surprised your face says ‘I don’t know what happened’ after only two months of training, does that not really mean your loss here?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You have defeated me, gained world peace, the right to life of mankind, the future, and you have earned the title of one and only hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at this rate, will you not forfeit the ordinary ‘common happiness’ that is due a person?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmph… so asinine… I never cared in the first place… whatever becomes of your family… Even if you as a married couple were deemed incapable as parents… tis all about the relations with me. I…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Indeed, seeming that… why, was I foolish to even consider such…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the days of more than ten years being sealed, I really did not care that much… In the days I spent with the child… cravingly I remember so much…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… one who despises other races…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, tis not something that can be helped for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My decision to train the child is impulsive, the result of being swept in the flow of events. I… do not intend to act as intermediary between parent and child, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I have already done so once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 -The first thing you should do is… rather than knowing the power of Hiro as a hero, rather than surpassing Hiro as a hero… first of all, comprehend the path that Hiro took to become a hero-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I only thought that it would be a factor of the growth of the child, and I would never teach anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you do not face your son and teach him, if the child still does not want to know, it matters not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will not meddle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is only one thing left to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, Ku… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you’re quite tough. Even after eating my deadly punch, it wasn’t enough to knock you out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Second Sword Saint rose up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He must have suffered a great deal of damage, but he most likely reduced the power slightly by twisting his neck just before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Should we say such agility was as one would expect, or perhaps the child being unable to end it is immature?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps, the Second Sword Saint is ‘still hiding power’ it seems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you do not take him down when the opportunity presents itself, you might come to regret it later, would you not?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for the moment, the child still has an overwhelming advantage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, going by the chatter among the audience, they might have the same recognition of the events.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He stood up! Rebal’s up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, are you okay? You were beaten so much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, Earth is so strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Until now, you were saying that the Son of Hiro and Mamu would lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I knew that, didn’t I? Young Earth is a man who does it when he does it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s ridiculous!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’ve reconsidered it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it’s true—“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, even after doing this much… yet they still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Surely, the son of the hero!!!!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hiiro… Mamu… Do you not notice now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of praise the crowd send in admiration, and how calm the child’s heart is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though he smiles fearlessly at his opponent, his eyebrows twitch slightly at the audience’s remarks, and the reactions pull at the child’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So…… Child…… It still seems to be insufficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even with this, it seems the world still does not recognize you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then show me more. As my disciple, rouse the crowd.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the words you most desire. Have them acknowledge ’As expected, he is Earth Lagann’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will watch that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis one thing I can do now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I am a master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I put in a story to make room once. I was going to do it somewhere, but I couldn’t find the timing here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was good tomorrow, but today I saw a movie and my tension went up.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
