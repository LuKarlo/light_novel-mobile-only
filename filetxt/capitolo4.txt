 【Imperial Warrior】
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only is it a title in this country, but also a qualification.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The qualification that the selected elites earn when they graduate from the Academy, and this will allow them to get a job that only Imperial Warriors can serve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The 【Hunter】 can freely cross world borders, and sometimes undertakes quests from the people, such as the extermination of demonic beasts and the development of unexplored lands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The 【Imperial Knight】 is a gathering of senior military candidates under direct orders from the Emperor. They work to maintain the security of the Empire, and sometimes undertake national-scale work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The 【Imperial Mage】 devotes his life to the research and development of magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are many others, but if one isn’t qualified as an 【Imperial Warrior】, they can’t get work at any of these organizations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father, despite earning terrible grades in his academy years, still stood among the top elites and became an Imperial Knight, and now he is the head of all the Imperial Warriors, the 【Prime Imperial Warrior】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally a commoner born of a fallen noble, he worked hard, became stronger, and sometimes saved the country, and eventually saved the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He defeated the Great Demon King, the god of the demons who tried to conquer the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The story of my father, who rose from commoner to hero, is praised, appreciated, and revered by the masses all over the world, and he is now called the 【Hero】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is ultimately my father’s story, and has nothing to do with me, his son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I have not inherited anything from my father other than his blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the war with the Great Demon King ended and the world became peaceful, as an aide of the Emperor my father’s duties are enormous, hence he can’t make time for his son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’ve never been taught anything by my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I’m expected to produce results that will prove I am my father’s son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as a result, I am superior to my father when he was my age, and yet, such a worthless dilemma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really…… I don’t get it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m home…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, I was in a bad mood and went back to my house even though it was still early afternoon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of the mansion just past the large garden, there was a maid tending to the garden.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The maid noticed me and opened her eyes for a moment, but soon showed a sharp smile like a crescent moon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Welcome back, little man. But the academy should still be in session, so please turn around and go right back.” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a Young Master, that’s not the proper way of speaking to me, but it is the normal mode of this maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t worry, ‘Sadiz’. I left early because of a headache.” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh my, the mentality of a slime as usual. I believe today should be a mock battle as well as the announcement of the written test results… did you lose to the princess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As expected, you’re too boring, Lil’ Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, a maid with a nasty smile and an unrelenting venomous tongue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems she was a war orphan, and was in this mansion before I was born, we were brought up as siblings, and now she is my exclusive maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her beautiful silver hair is tied together behind her head, and the skirt of her maid outfit, which should be neat and tidy, is short, reaching just above her knees for some reason, and her breasts and voluptuous body is very stimulating to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She is young at only 19 years old, and to me she is more like a mean elder sister than a maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, she is also my first love, and I’m sure she’s the one I want to end up with someday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s not my fiancée. But I intend to make her my future wife.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay. The exams are over, and all that’s left is the graduation match. No matter what kind of grades I get now, my evaluation will not drop.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, as the second-seat, you are free to choose your career path after graduation. So, if Lil’ Earth says he’ll advance to the Imperial Knight, it seems to be a definite matter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right? Then no one would complain, and isn’t that what everyone expects? My father is the Hero.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, someone’s crankier than usual today. Well, not only did he lose to the princess. Did the master meet you and tell you something?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s another mark… you’re so easy to read, such thin skin, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did she see me?! How does she know!? Or, skin…… I don’t get how she would know that! No, it’s only natural, she washes my body in the bath sometimes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damnit. Always.the son of a hero.,…… Hero this hero that. In the first place, the Great Demon King is dead, the demons are gone, and in an age when there is no war with other countries, warriors are stagnant. If I was to become first place, and was the son of a hero, is there a place to demonstrate it? If not, second place will be enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is no use complaining about this to Sadiz, who is a maid. But when Sadiz is always quick with her sharp poisonous tongue, I become irritated and lash out emotionally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And only at times like this, Sadiz had a serious face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I understand you feel pressure and annoyance in the selfish expectations and voices of those around you… even if you can’t share such pain with me, a maid. But the people around you and the master… and, me as well…… it’s impossible not to have expectations of Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is well known that the hero, ‘Hiro’, was a failure in his childhood… That’s why, at the moment, how much growth has already been achieved by Little Earth and how much more excellent can he become? It’s gone beyond expectations, and everyone dreams of your future. Your existence means that much…… I really want you to understand that, even though it’s truly selfish of me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With gentle and firm words, Sadiz tells me this as she bowed her head down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is really cunning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When should we have our wedding?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… But… Once in a while, besides scolding or encouragement…… I want a reward.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no choice but to reply while facing away with embarrassment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Reward, is it? You are aware you receive more pocket money than the typical income of an ordinary man? You can buy whatever you want, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, that’s not what I meant…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, but you can’t buy any ero-books or a harlot. And now… not even A・WO・MANS・HEA・RT ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And unfortunately, it is not included in my terms of employment so I can’t educate Little man in romance, even if you ask, I can’t do it～♪!.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A long time ago, when I was still young, I asked Sadiz to “be my bride” and she refused, but since then she has been aware of my feelings and lustful nature, but this is how I get shut down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I thought that I could marry Sadiz if I became a little more mature, but recently, no matter how hard I tried, the image of Sadiz marrying me was completely nonexistent, and other than my father-related issues, I was a non topic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when she saw my blatant disappointment, Sadiz sighed and made a proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. I don’t know if it’s going to be motivational for Lil’ Earth, but… today, I’m cleaning the sealed pedestal for the first time in a year, so you want to come with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sealed? Oh…… Father’s sword…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, that’s right. The legendary sword that destroyed the Great Demon King. Because it is too powerful, it is a sword that the master stuck into the pedestal and sealed. If you look at it, wouldn’t you be a little more motivated?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well. It made me happy when I was a kid, but… now, even if I look at my father’s sword… maybe if he gave it to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t too keen on Sadiz’ proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day to release the lock for the sealed room in the mansion comes only once a year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father’s sword is sealed there. It’s a sword handed down from a myth, a sword of legend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s no use getting any weird ideas. Even if you think you’ll become stronger by taking the sword, the master is the only one who can pull the sword out of the pedestal anyway.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I- I know!.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sword that I thought I would inherit someday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for me who was fed up with the title of ‘The son of the Hero’, it was a delicate matter when asked whether my mood would improve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it was… until I met ‘him’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Taking more liberties here! She constantly refers to Earth as 坊ちゃま (Bochaman) which means “Male Junior”. Considering her personality it should be a more playful and teasing manner of calling him so I opted for “Little Man” and occasionally Lil’ Earth. “Young man” sounded more authoritative and respectful and that’s not what she’s about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Her name is actually pronounced “Sadisu”. 3 guesses why! Any I went with Sadiz, also considered “Sadith”.
