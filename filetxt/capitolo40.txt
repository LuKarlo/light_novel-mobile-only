 “Earth… What the hell are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I slowly took small steps to create some distance, Rebal doesn’t engage, he instead expresses his feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe, with the silence that has currently fallen over the arena, it seems the people are having similar thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a magic swordsman, you abandoned your sword… yet you used this kind of technique… Did you learn it from Sir Hiro and Lady Mamu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How did I gain this power and fighting style?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, perhaps it’s my father, would be the reason they’ll consider first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Aren’t they just as surprised? Their mouths are wide open next to his Majesty!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………… Eh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, I lean forward and point to the guest seats and my shocked parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing that, Rebal’s expression seemed as if he swallowed a bitter bug.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not just Martial art. Its movement is completely different from the Imperial style… And yet, the mold is unique, yet it flows beautifully without faltering… How did you do that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I’m sure everyone’s curious about how.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father also leans out and waits for my answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I can’t mention anything about Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So all I can say is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In order to improve my basic skills, I practiced footwork, and earnestly spar… repeat mock battles… and I read!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not a lie. The process was mostly repetition.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You read… Don’t mess around! With just that…… that alone was all it took!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Rebal appears unconvinced by it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because there’s pride in saying, ‘I’ve only done that’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve been single-mindedly swinging my sword. While studying abroad, I gained experience in swordsmanship with warriors and powerhouses from other countries… In addition, even a fire dragon was brought down with this sword! All to become the strongest swordsman!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from being a fire dragon, I had relentless training for two months with the opponent who fought the Dragon King and knocked it down… Well, it’s virtual, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… that…… I’m at the mercy of a martial art, of which I don’t even know when, where, or how you learned it… Just mock battles? And reading? Don’t be silly! I’m listening to you seriously!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Rebal shouted at my words, ‘that can’t be all, right?’, that I wasn’t taught by my parents, that I didn’t learn anything from them, that I had learned everything in secret, that I had learned everything from him, and that I did it all with basic training, mock battles and reading.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to be honest … really, that’s all. I even read through the Destiny series.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I kept on doing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true, Rebal. I’m like you… so I possess good conviction… I didn’t put in more effort or earned more achievements than you. It’s just, really…… That’s all I did.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still over this short period…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yet that’s all I did, but… I feel like I’ve changed my view on things a little bit. Maybe in a big way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Rebal said, ‘There must be something else’, if he insistently brings it up, I felt I should reveal it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ever since I entered the Academy, I was irritated by a wall that I couldn’t overcome. As my father and mother’s child, I wasn’t enough… That was the opinion of those around me, they knew of my power and were convinced, because I couldn’t break through that wall.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s when the public expectations of me were gradually getting heavier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t have the collective strength of the princess, or magical talent like Fu. I don’t have special sword skills that have been learned through bloody efforts like you. I was just wielding a magic sword that imitated my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, at the same time, unlike the princesses, there was nothing lesser I could project on, so I gained an inferiority complex.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried desperately to be like my father, but I didn’t grow up or awaken like I and everyone wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You know that, too. I’m the only one who was different… I’m the only one who wasn’t good enough… I’m the only one who’s a failure… He’s such a half-hearted person.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ear… th… No…… That’s not true.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t have to worry about it. Everyone thought so. You guys… The people in this country… surely…… even my parents would have thought so. And even me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I began to think of myself, and I gradually lost confidence in myself, and I was getting depressed and sulky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But one day, a meddling guy told me clearly. I don’t have the same talent as my father. Even if I imitate my father, I would spend my whole life and never catch up with him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s not like I’m lacking, still immature, or might awaken someday. He clearly said ‘I can’t do it’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The audience got abuzz with the surprise same as Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I glanced at the guest seat, my father and mother looked surprised and shocked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But instead he said this. If I can’t catch up with my father by imitating him… I should think about making the most of my own individuality…… that’s what.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, wear something that suits me, not my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those words were truly eye catching, and I was able to change from there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I still don’t know if this martial art suits me or not, and I’m still on the path. It’s just that I was so refreshed. I’m neither my father nor my mother. I’m the right fit for me, so I’m going my own way… that’s what I realized.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s guidance itself was certainly important and I affirmed myself, and in a short time he pulled me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the other factors that helped me grow like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I felt lighter now that I lost something heavy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unexpectedly, I could voice my thoughts so naturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, for us, ‘The Second Generation’……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t… mess with…… Don’t you mess with me, Earth! Do you realize what you’re saying!? The Magic Sword of Hero, Hiro, who saved the world and defeated the Great Demon King… the War Maiden Mamu’s Martial Art… going your own way without inheriting all that power? You…… What will we do if we don’t inherit the power of our great forefathers and pass it on to future generations!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal shouted furiously at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… I didn’t think you would say that! This is…… it’s such a sad thing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s going on… You’re always so cool, now you’re surprisingly heated?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t dodge this! As a trusted friend… You…… you’re the one… we’ve been together for a long time… leading us…… that’s why you… nevertheless… such a thing, it can’t be!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just Rebal, but the princess and the Fu as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Seven Great Heroes. The powers that saved the world, saved mankind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For us who are their blood relatives to not inherit that, the fact is that idea is unforgivable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll make you understand… Earth! We’re not fighting alone! Supported by many, inheriting their thoughts, carrying them on their backs, standing here! To you who tries to despise everything for your own selfish reasons…… I’ll do my best to make you understand!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The usually cool Rebal is hot and intense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going to use my strength to ‘defeat you’ not to ‘win’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m in that frame of mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if I’m selfish, my stance in this match won’t change. I’ll prove myself and show my power to those who didn’t believe I could win! To you, to my father, to my mother, to Sadiz, to the people of this country!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now there’s one more…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And to reward the humble fellow who guided me before I could prove myself… I’ll show it in the results! Enchantment with a fist!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To reward the one who is still watching over me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that sense, it might not be a selfish reason for me alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like a thank you to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe it’s better off than helping him read a hundred books he likes, or politely thanking him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There you go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… as I tend to blabber and whine with my mouth, I’ll try communicating it to your body!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I’ll show you! To you who were cozy in the warm environment of Imperial City…… My resolve!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the real thing from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I will stand in response.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me now, I’d be hit head-on with Rebal’s confidence and experience.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course. Now, prove yourself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just a word, his words, which affirmed that, gave me more confidence, and at the same time my heart became heated, and my back was pushed out hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t feel like losing anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll be sure to reply to your impressions! But I didn’t make it this time, so I’ll post it first! I’m sorry! I was late getting up. I’m sorry I was born!
