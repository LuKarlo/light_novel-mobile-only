 “Earth… abandoned……? Certainly…… he was hesitant about becoming an Imperial Knight, but… he also stopped aiming for me and Mamu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That girl… she was so determined… I…… left it to Sadiz, what is this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After hearing my words my father and mother were murmuring while casting their eyes down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… I…… all this time…… what have…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, who had seen me more than anyone else, was so shocked she stopped cheering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But don’t make that face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You don’t think I’m doing this to have these three people make that face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, I’ll have you say ‘well done’, so watch me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go… Earth…… This time, I’m moving… Can you follow?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To do that, I have to beat this guy in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at that moment, Rebal, who had been upset and trembling until now, suddenly fell silent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, the air has apparently changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than being quiet, it’s as if he jumped into a deep sea of thought…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho… That Second Sword Saint……he accessed it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar, who was watching from up high muttered, somewhat impressed by Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「……accessed?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Have I not mentioned this before? Humans usually only exert about 30% of their full capabilities. However, tis possible to draw out the upmost limit of one’s ability when in extreme danger, such as being at the verge of death in the scene of a fire. However, there are some individuals in the world who intentionally access that state. By frequently experiencing crisis situations and scenes of carnage, the body and spirit can imprint the sensation of that time and enter the situation.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, speaking of which, I’ve heard of that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And by drawing out such hidden power of their own volition, they can draw out power several times more potent than usual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis referred as entering the ‘Zone’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Zone. In other words, that’s what Rebal learned during his period of study abroad… No, the state he finally arrived at.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. Tis about 1.3% stronger than I assumed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also seems to have admitted to making a slight miscalculation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, it’ll have a little influence on the calculation that I can win…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial Sword… 【Gale Fang】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast! The moment I thought about it, a shock came over my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, tch ch!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve finally got you, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I only knew the moment I jumped out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment my body reacted to avoid it, his sword had already hit me in the shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy! Beyond my dynamic vision and prediction!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s dangerous. I need to keep a distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I got hit so easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In training with Tre’ainar, I don’t react after seeing it, but I trained to look ahead to the other person’s shoulders, muscles, eyes, legs, and everything, but I didn’t realize Rival started moving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even with the child’s pre-reading, there is a slight delay in the reaction… A thrust which has eliminated all useless power and habits…… It must have been gained through much harsh training and many bloody battles.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But if it’s training, I’ve done as much…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Two months… and most of all, the child has never truly experienced ‘actual battle’. No matter how much you continue to spar, the actual battle is still different. For the child who has yet to experience an exchange with life on the line in the truest sense of the word…… is an opponent who has entered the zone not a little arduous?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a heavy load for me. Tre’ainar’s words weigh heavily on me, but Rebal chases after me unaware of my situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I tried to keep my distance in the backstep, and I immediately gained some room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Imperial Sword, 【Flash Meteor Blade】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A series of attacks. A high-speed slash attack that gives the illusion of multiple swords being drawn out at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is clearly faster than the previous technique!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the peripheral field of view, the angle of the hand, the handle, the movement of the arm, somehow evade… evade…… I can’t!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, it’s out, high level skill, meteor sword! Rebal’s real power at last! I can’t see it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So fast! Is that really an academy student?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth is somehow avoiding… No, he’s not! Agh, more and more…… Blood.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, Earth! Don’t run around, fight like a man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow, Rebal is so cool…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let’s go! My cheeks are cut… got my arms and legs, I can’t dodge!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this rate…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There is no winning… for the child in his current state…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t win now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Tre’ainar finally declared that, all of Rebal’s slashes struck my whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, oh, oh, oooooooooooh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this was not a sword with a blunt blade for the mock battle, but seriously done, my whole body would have been chopped into pieces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is Rebal’s resolve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The power of a genius who strives.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t win.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『「There is no winning… yes, not as it is now!!」』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the voice in my heart matched Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? What…? What are you laughing at, Earth! Have you given up the match?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Am I laughing? In this situation, am I?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe that’s the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or maybe, but I’m not the only one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure that’s probably because Tre’ainar is laughing now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked like he was in a good mood as he spoke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. I shall ask once again. Who were you before?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the pain was being engraved all over my body, Tre’ainar cheerfully asked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I used to be… the Hero, Hiro’s ……just his Son…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal felt something in my sudden solitude. However, we continue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, who are you now?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m your disciple…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so, but as a disciple, have you no notion of your standing? The first and last disciple of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And what will you be from this day forth?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s decided!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the son of a hero. Not wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’ve been mumbling for a while now! Are you serious about this fight, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am the Demon King’s disciple. That’s not wrong either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But from now on, I’m going to be a new me, all that way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “New, and true me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes! Show it to everyone! Go, Earth!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time Tre’ainar has ever mentioned my name since we met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know if there was a deep meaning there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He just called my name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for the first time, Tre’ainar, who had only called me ‘child’ and had only seen me as ‘the son of hero Hiro’, called my name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That made me so happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? This uplifting feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just that I got this hot urge just to be called by my name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t feel like losing!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it’s still incomplete…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, this is me, Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In exchange for severe pain, the magic holes of my whole body which I intentionally pried open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the magic tank of the body, pull out a large amount of magic power, and keep it cloaked to the whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Breakthrough Mode.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!? This wave of magical power… What? What does this mean!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? What’s wrong with you, Fu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From Earth’s body… No way? The amount of magical power being released… Is it going to be!? Why? I should be able to do it, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Fu noticed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if there is magical power, it is not possible to release it without corresponding magic holes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the ‘original’ number of the magic holes which were open in me was below Fu’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, it is not possible to do so. But I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I forced the number of open magic holes to increase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This… Power! Why is Earth…? What the hell is that? How did he do that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That light… The Great Demon King… the color is different… but it’s similar!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… The Great Demon King Tre’ainar’s light was red in color. But…… certainly there’s a resemblance.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Overflowing…… Magical Power itself…… Aura of magic…… a shining ‘green’ aura!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, both father and mother, and His Majesty lean forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes… The color of the magic differs from mine. As you mentioned at the beginning, you were proficient with the Terran Attribute. The green light of the Gaia, full of life. Hiro and other heroes fought against me, but do not know the name or principle of the mode, so tis ‘similar’…… stay in place. Then you will have nothing to worry about, would you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only concern was whether my parents would think ‘I could use the power of the Great Demon King’, but it was unnecessary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, Tre’ainar’s says his own ‘actual fighting style’ is completely different from what I exhibited today, so I don’t think they’ll realize the connection between us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This power is… Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… How warm and beautiful… Light…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I have to do is show it to you. To Sadiz and the Princess… And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To you too, Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The body is lighter than before, full of power, it’s hot, buzzing and even thoughts are faster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not forget? Ninety seconds, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “10 seconds!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I don’t think I’m going to stop anymore!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Soraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Left! Left! Left! Left! Left! Left! Left!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is different from the flicker from before, that just frustrates the opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Resonate to the opponent’s core. A method to hit without dispersing the impact, by sustainably hitting a single spot again and again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, what!? Now, Earth started hitting again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s, just a left punch, Rebal can’t escape!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, what is it? When I thought that a weird light had wrapped Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s much faster than before… I mean, the attack is too fast to see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not the left to punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, can’t avoid it… impossible! …… I’m in the God Concentration… me!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If anything, I’ll beat you with this one left!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thoroughly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-This is Earth? Earth had this power…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fast… and the left fist is penetrating! In that case, Rebal can’t prevent damage even if he guards.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s like a hammer with the sharpness of a spear… This is…… Earth’s real power?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, look more, Dad, Mom!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know… the Earth that I’ve fought so far… what’s going on? What the hell is going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s too strong… I thought we were strong and came back… I can’t believe that Earth was so strong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess, Fu…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little… man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz, watch me more!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ruaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, u, guu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sensation that remains in the fist. The sound of the bones as they are broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart is slightly shaken while continuing to beat my childhood friend’s face as he cannot react to anything. But Rebal, also…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, gu, u… Uoooooooooooooooh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Rebal’s eyes aren’t dead yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Verve. Yell. Swordsmanship. Fighting spirit. With all his mind, Rival howls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not for show.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more he tries to blow me away, the more the air ripples, and cracks run into the walls of the arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you’re still good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haa, ha… Strong…… no way…… I didn’t think you would be this strong… But I won’t lose! You’re going to lose! In this first round… I will draw on all my strength, I won’t lose!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal is also trying to do everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hey, child… tis a blow of a sword that spreads widely. Even if you avoid the blade, will you not be blown away by the shockwave that follows? If that is the theory… best to keep a certain distance and avoid it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar muttered, but I knew without being told.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can you handle this? Earth! It brought down a fire dragon, earned me the title of Dragon Slayer, my strongest sword!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal denies me with all his might. It’s the power for that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
