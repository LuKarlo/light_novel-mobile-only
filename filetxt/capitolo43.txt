 He was so bewildered he couldn’t express his words well, but he tells me with a sad expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That technique is… it once…… destroyed Sadiz’s hometown… it was used to kill Sadiz’s parents…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As we were rushing to the scene, a huge spiral rising into the heavens… eh … It’s… that was the technique that the Great Demon King Tre’ainar showed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t just my father. To my mother, I’m… far from disappointing. I’m sad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I…… I used that technique, so…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, come. Tell me all about how you got this stuff… what were you doing without your father or mother’s knowledge?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, my father grabbed my wrist tightly and tried to take me away with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a minute… my match… you watched me, didn’t you? Father, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How, how was I? I got stronger… I, I’m much, I got much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s true that technique wasn’t a good one for my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know. About Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I did my best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A lot of sweat, endured severe pain, and I rose to the challenge today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it’s okay to just say one word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father, to me-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Idiot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What got stronger… if you want to be strong, is anything acceptable?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? No, what …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh… I see… So that was it……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is it true that the technique he just used was the Great Demon King Tre’ainar’s?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Idiot, why would the son of a hero use the Demon King’s skill!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s the case… it’s a shame!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You have no pride as a son of a hero!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, isn’t that funny in the first place? That failure of a son was so strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. No matter how much, I thought it was funny when he was overpowering that Rebal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, maybe he got his hands on some vile power!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? That kind of…… such a guy is the son of a hero… and you’re trying to be a warrior!?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fifteen years… I’ve been in this country… didn’t I realize that simple thing until today…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So what, don’t mess with me!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was screaming before I knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Earth! Hey, just come quietly now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father grabs my wrist and tries to take me in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I could not agree to that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if I would be taken in like this, so I waved off my father’s hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tell me everything? What? Like there’s anything left to say now? When you finally looked at me, you’re looking with such eyes … if my father and mother looked at me better, they’d understand! If you two actually looked at me… what I bumped into, struggled with, agonized over… if the world hadn’t imposed a convenient title on me… it would have been things like that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, what’s wrong with me right now? I didn’t cheat, I didn’t have a hand in anything suspicious! I trained and studied, I fought with my own strength! Only to have you have to look at me like that! I hit a wall, and I didn’t know for a long time that everyone says the second generation is a lost cause, or that we’re not enough. Even though I finally got here… Why!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know what I was talking about from there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The war ended before I was born… don’t drag my generation along, push us forward!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t calm down, and I put into words everything I had emotionally bottled up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I already know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now I understand. This country…… including my father… me… no one cared about Earth Lagann.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth! What are you …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What you were interested in is the son of an ideal hero who is convenient for you… as for me…… Earth Lagann…… I didn’t matter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the wish I’ve had until today, to make everyone recognize me as ‘Earth Lagann’ instead of ‘Son of the Hero’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was impossible from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the world is not interested in Earth Lagann.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N-No! You’re wrong, Earth! Calm down! Your dad and mom don’t think that at all!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father, who changed his expression, grabs both my shoulders and shouts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the words couldn’t reach my heart anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Your father, your mother, and Sadiz love you from the bottom of our hearts! Believe me! We’re a family!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Family. Yes, even though we’re family…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I’m worried about you! I’m not doing this because you’re not good enough! If you… If you’re involved with relatives of Tre’ainar or the remnants of the Demon Army…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I already… okay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father is right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyhow… I can’t believe you said that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father is a hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hero who protected the world cannot overlook me using the technique of the demon that was the nemesis of mankind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - What got stronger… if you want to be strong, is anything acceptable?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words of my father …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― As expected, he’s the son of a hero!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words of the world…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Show it to everyone! Go, Earth!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Words of Tre’ainar, who lit my heart on fire and pushed my back… for all this time…… However, because Tre’ainar is the Great Demon King, that power will not be recognized no matter what.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I knew it would be this hard… I would not want to be born as a hero’s child… Father”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, my father… What my father looked like… I couldn’t see it anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let go…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Gu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just shook off his clinging hand and put the last blow to my defenseless father’s face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was either what I said, or that he was surprised at being attacked, that my fist connected with my father’s face, which would usually not happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The face of my father, who I hit for the first time in my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than being refreshed, I just felt worse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hiro!? Earth…… wait, Earth! Please, calm down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My mother, who was taking care of Sadiz, cried in tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as if to drown out that cry……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, that guy! He hit Hiro!?!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stupid, to hit your own parent… What a guy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fallen to the point he would sink so low!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Domestic violence?! I can’t stand it anymore!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somebody, get that trash!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Again…I heard a terrible noise…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Earth! What… Sir Hiro… Anyway, now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut it, Rebal. You’re not involved…… just leave it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nothing mattered anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Calm yourself…… child. …… Not yet…… you may still return. Besides, I am at fault in this.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, what are you talking about? Return? Where?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What was today for? Do you truly intend to throw everything away here, you cannot get it all back if you do, can you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Reveal everything about me to the world. They may not believe it at first, but… I will tell you all that I know, what only Hiro would know. Reveal that, perhaps they may yet believe in the existence of ghosts.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, you… it’s fine…… ha ha…… At such a time, you were the only one who gave a little warmth to my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… It’s okay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay… I already… I don’t need to go back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feeling a little guilty, Tre’ainar tries to sway me, but that’s enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you, Tre’ainar. And I’m sorry for ruining it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… Earth? What…… What are you talking about? Talking to yourself… who are you talking to?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without answering my bewildered father’s question, I turned to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You are at fault? Why would you say that? What’s wrong with me being your disciple?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Heh!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I told him how I felt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… I can’t stand it anymore! What the hell is going on? Earth, what are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, princess! Ah… enough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Here comes the outfield to intervene further.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess starts running in an angry state followed Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, what are you doing? And why did you hit Lord Hiro? What is the technique of the Great Demon King? Calm down, explain it from the beginning and convince us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, Earth. As it is, even if it’s self-abandonment, will anything be gained? Everyone’s anger will be directed at Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Explain it. From the princess’s point of view, it’s natural to explain everything about my ability because she knows them the most in a sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu, I guess he’s genuinely worried to be saying that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the words that came out of my mouth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Enough… I don’t care…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Reckless, such an irresponsible way to speak.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “‘I don’t care.’ Don’t be silly, Earth! It doesn’t matter…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t touch me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it doesn’t matter. That’s why I brushed aside the princess’s hand as she reached out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He pushed away the princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Have you fallen that far!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To raise your hand to a woman, the lowest!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kick him out of school, that guy right now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Warrior disqualification!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Permanent expulsion from the warrior world!” [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I know. I knew this was going to happen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, be quiet! Everyone calm down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His Majesty also tries to calm everyone down, but his voice is drowned out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, everyone… hey, Earth. Let’s talk later, come with your father now and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dad… enough… it’s okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father rushes to take me away to protect me from unstoppable jeers and things being thrown.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’ve already refused that hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Father, I’m just… just once… my dad… everyone… not as a son of a hero. I just wanted you to praise me… that’s all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!? Earth…… wait…… why such a thing… don’t just say ‘that’s all’. Your dad is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Sorry…… I couldn’t be the son of a perfect ideal hero … I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mother… Sorry…… Sadiz…… I’m just annoying… I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From that point on, I lost myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Earth…!? Hey, wait, Earth! Where are you going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, because I was surrounded by everyone, I summoned the 【Great Magic Spiral】 in my right hand, and I dug underground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eaaaaaaaaaaarth!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using all the magic I had left, shocking my father before me, I ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run away, run away, just run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I jumped out of the ground when I ran out of magic power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After passing through the Imperial City gate, I ran out of the Imperial City alone for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of what was overflowing from my eyes, I couldn’t see in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I try to shake it off, it will overflow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Me, in the future… Become a hero like my father!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - That’s it! Oh. If it’s Earth, you can be a Great Hero!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Mother… you’re late today too…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Earth…… Yes, today was my day off too! It’s okay to be mad! Today I’m going to make anything you like, for Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Sadiz…… Are you leaving?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - No, I’m not going anywhere, am I? I’ll always be with Lil’ Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
