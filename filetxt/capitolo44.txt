<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I yelled, screamed, and threw myself all over the place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Running around I repeatedly kicked stones, struck the ground, and hit my head against the trees.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anger, sadness, and so on just getting tangled up, I just kept crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t do that forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~… ha~ah…… Damn it…… a~, damn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I cried so much I couldn’t even feel hunger, all the same I was worn out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was already night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I left the Imperial City and ran around like crazy, so I don’t even know which way the city is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this the first time in my life I’m sleeping outdoors?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I left with just my clothes, so I don’t have any money, what’s going to happen to me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… as it is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha… sh*t…… damn it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never knew. There are so many stars.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I lay upon the meadow with my arms stretched out, I could see the myriad of stars shining in the night sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew for the first time that I had always slept regularly indoors at night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… At last…… have you calmed down a little?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was Tre’ainar, right beside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that Tre’ainar left me alone until I stopped crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… I’m beat, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tears stopped. However, the fatigue came out suddenly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, when I feel tired and feel depressed, something is likely to come up again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m today… father and… my mother… and now with everyone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you are calm, return to the Imperial City and talk to your parents. Are you anxious?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I get back now, at least my father… my father and mother would have a lot to say to me, but I felt like they would welcome me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, with what I’ll face should I go back, enough, I don’t want to go home, I felt I couldn’t go home.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t… already…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, tis… I do not believe…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… I can’t… everyone hates me… my father and my mother… Sadiz, too… even though I didn’t know… I hurt her…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are his only son. There is no reason not to love you. However, they may be renowned as hero and heroine, but they were just lacking as parents… do not give up on them… as an adult, you forgive… that is also an option… That maid and… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… I can’t.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar may be right, but my heart still couldn’t choose it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I threw away everything close to me and ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me, Sadiz… and…… surprisingly…… more than I thought, my father and mother… maybe I liked it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『……… Tis so… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… feared by Sadiz…… my father and mother looking at me like that… then I said all that… I already… I can’t.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t face those eyes anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m scared of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Do you hate me?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? …… Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was suddenly awakened by Tre’ainar’s unexpected words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At the very least, had I not deemed to demonstrate that technique to you… none of this would have come to pass, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t say anything to Tre’ainar, who looked me in the eye and told me straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, to think he felt guilty here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you talking about? I’m the one who finally learned from you… I mean… If you think calmly, I used the technique of the Great Demon King, I should have known that my father, mother, and everyone would make a big fuss. Yet I…… I was so excited about getting stronger day by day that I didn’t even consider it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, none of this would have happened is I wasn’t trained by Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then, with how I spent these two months, if asked ‘Would it be better if I didn’t?’, I would absolutely disagree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I see…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However many people he had killed as the Great Demon King, I don’t know him at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I don’t know about the era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So maybe I didn’t understand it comes with a payoff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father, mother, Sadiz, and the world’s feelings for the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Tre’ainar I know is a pretty sore loser, with a terrible naming sense, decent mood, and a good sense of humanity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well,… what will you do now? Leave your home…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… I’m not thinking about anything… just…… I just ran…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m not thinking about anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I don’t want to go back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I can’t go back anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I threw it all away, so…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no point in going back anymore… I wonder what it was… my life so far… no one looked at me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, as I lay down in the meadow again, I looked up at the sky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the enormous breathtaking night sky, I was sick of everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A little…… listen to me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar sat next to me, his eyes looking far away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Things may seem inconceivable, but so long as you still live, there are many different routes to take… you are young.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But unfortunately, whatever your path, it may be impossible to earn a reputation other than ‘son of a hero’, by normal means.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Talk about throwing salt to a wound.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although it was already obvious, it was a severe remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It may be abominable to you, but the name of ‘Hiro, the Great Hero Who Defeated the Great Demon King’ is bigger than I could have imagined… as such, no matter how grand your performance in that match, the only evaluation from the masses would be ‘as expected, he is the son of a hero’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know. I heard those words many times during the match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how it’s been the last fifteen years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, it was impossible from the beginning… why do you look at me, not as I am, but as a hero’s son.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was impossible after all. The reality hit pretty hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, ‘Using the technique of the Great Demon King’ or ‘Warrior disqualification’, I’ve fallen further.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even if I didn’t put in any effort from the beginning……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But there is only one… a way to make them recognize you as Earth Lagann, not as the son of a hero.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was impossible to do anything from the beginning… the conclusion I expected, there was an unexpected phrase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H-Hey, you’re not going to tell me to become a Demon King and raise my infamy, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wrong. In general, the only thing that resonates with notoriety is the evaluation that ‘the son of the hero was the worst after all’. Still, if you are fine with it, you can beat the people speaking ill of you, that is a different story.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s just…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather, do not equate the Demon King with infamy! Tis the same narrow-minded outlook of the masses, attaching labels like dark and evil to demons while opting light and justice for themselves… Well, not that it matters much to me…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… I see… I’m sorry,… I didn’t mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, tis fine. Anyway, what I want to say is… Oh~, what to do…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I get up again and face Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is there only one way to do something that should not be possible?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The story seemed to deviate a bit, but I corrected it and Tre’ainar spoke to me in a calm tone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For example, child. I once… unified hundreds of countries and tribes… managed them…… led them to fight against the human race. Not only the war, but also troublesome politics and coordination, such hectic days… but everything functioned.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s an old story of Tre’ainar’s that I’ve never heard of before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, I was a supreme being, and I was beyond descriptors such as a genius. From childhood, magic, wisdom, and combat ability were all called ‘the strongest in history’…… Well, I lost to your father. With a cowardly hand. An obscene hand. I mentioned it twice because tis important.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And here I shall ask you one question…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I thought he was proud, but he suddenly looked serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And say to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Who was the strongest in history before I was called the strongest… Do you understand?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh? …… Come on, well… I don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My point. Naturally. Most likely, even amongst the demons tis not known. The one who was the strongest before me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s the story leading to? I don’t know anything, so I just shut up and listen…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In other words, no matter how many people have made a name before, if more appear, people’s consciousness will be renewed even if they do not mean it to. Tis how things go.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Renew…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, a renewal!” Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Tre’ainar stood up with powerful words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you want to break away from being the son of a hero and still be recognized as your own existence… You take your father ‘s feat , the defeat of the Great Demon King… and achieve one a far greater.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do that, and not only the Empire, but the world will recognize Earth Lagann!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was, as I was to say, a story of an indescribably large scale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but laugh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A feat beyond my father… Ha ha…… What’s that? What could it be?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you know of such a thing? I know nothing of the world as it is today, and I do not know if such a feat exists in the world after the war ended. But unless you do that… Earth Lagann will remain the son of the hero who ran away from home.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from there, I don’t know Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what is there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is the feat that exceeds my father who defeated the Great Demon King and saved the human race?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Still, I do not know what it may be. But the answer is not in the Empire. This leaves no choice but to go through the lands where your father’s influence does not reach, to push forward to find something, to overcome numerous trials with your fists, to see many things, to learn many things, and to do ‘something’ at the end. Something to surpass your father!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A feat that exceeds the legend that defeated the Great Demon King, that not even the Great Demon King Tre’ainar knows of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know what it is, but if I do it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Aim for the World, Earth!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how Tre’ainar showed me the guiding principle on which to proceed, even though he didn’t know the answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surpass… father…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you cannot do that and still want to dispose of your detractors… Well, I have neither reason nor duty to stop you, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… It’ll be me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, decide what you like. You are still alive, unlike me. So long as you do not return home, you must decide on your own future.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t aim for my father. Surpass my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the only way to get acknowledged.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surpass him… I’ve never thought about that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was a kid, I said, ‘I’m going to be a hero like my father’, but I also said, ‘I’m going to be more than my father’. No……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No…There was, that time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, when I was a kid, I said it without thinking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Fu is the best wizard in the world! Rebal is the best swordsman in the world! Phianse is the best spearmaster in the world! And I’m going to be the strongest ultra hero in the world, better than my father!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, a childish dream, and in a sense the origin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I already knew the answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha…… no way… this…… to think I would ever remember this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed at the mere recollection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, it was a pure child’s dream that said out loud without thinking deeply about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I gradually lost my confidence and stopped speaking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To think I would remember it in this way and be able to do it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay… bring it on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly I noticed it, something was boiling up from deep within me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A feeling that fired me up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not an ultra hero, but…but still… let’s become ‘something’ that surpasses my father!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Easy to simply say I’ll surpass him, but there are many aspects.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strength, fame, achievements.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, we don’t yet know what to surpass.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So then, cross the world in search of that ‘something’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aim for the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oooh…uooooooooooooooooh!! What Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttt!!! Look out world!! You son of a Bitch!! uooooooooooooooooh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To the world, in the sky, to the stars, I screamed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not dead yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth Lagann is still here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I yelled, my eyes began to tear up a little. Enough already, I rather howl out my feelings with all my might.

 『Huh, seems you have reverted a little bit of yourself. Such a simple fellow. But tis fine. The defeated is beaten down, and stays prone forever, never to rise back up. So…… you have not lost yet. Well, a tad of a crybaby, but… for today I witnessed no such thing.』

 『Nnh, d-do not be mistaken. I desire to see the rest of the world, tis simply more convenient. Tis not for your sake! 』

 “Hahahahaha, what’s that~?”

 Oh, I’m simple.

 This was the worst day in my life, yet I’m about to rise back up.

 That’s all there is to it…

 Author’s Notes
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your company so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was finally able to write this far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I didn’t think you’d get any comments or drills.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Many people were able to react to my stories, including pros and cons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am very grateful as a writer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I did not think that the discussion would spread so much on one theme of ‘parent-child issue’, but I was made to think that ‘I see, there is such an idea’ in each opinion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, from the last despair to the time you stand up, is it too early? This time you might think.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I could have written a period of despair for a while, but I read ‘Dare Royal’s Letter’ and decided to do this. If you have never read it, please read it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And let me apologize. I couldn’t reply to everyone this time because of the amount of impressions I had.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do my best to stay up all night on Friday, Saturday and Sunday weekend, so please update it first this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sorry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was a short time until today, but thank you for reading. Thank you for the next story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not the last episode. It’s going to last a little longer.
