<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To me, the child was merely the offspring of Hiro and Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the occasion I first ‘saw’ him… nonetheless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ How about it, Earth? Amazing, isn’t it? This is the sword of the hero that your dad used!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Wow, awesome!Dad, can I use it someday?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Sure you can. Oh, you’re your father and mother’s son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having lived for thousands of years, I believed the days and months that make up these ten years would prove to be insignificant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the flow of time I felt after having died and became a mere spiritual existence was ridiculously long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No one could recognize my existence. No one could see me. No one can hear my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My former nemeses, the heroes, were no exception.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a spirit, I possessed the Sword of the Hero, Hiro, which was then sealed within the armory of his mansion and left alone for years in a narrow, dark space with no opportunity to see the outside world since.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had nothing to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no change in the days I spent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only on the occasions when the maid would come to clean up, or Hiro and young children visited the arsenal to boast of days past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An eternal prison for the soul that cannot be completely eliminated and extinguished.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If those days were the punishment due to the defeated, it was quite cruel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, child. You do not know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ No, who are you!! Why are you here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day we first met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You recognized my existence, raised your voice to me, and were able to hold a conversation with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How I was saved by your existence, which destroyed the days I thought would be of eternal solitude?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I am The Great Demon King Tre’ainar…… who once sought to conquer the world, but was slain by your father and his companions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time in 15 years, I mentioned my name. You responded to the name. However, it gave me so much joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was not all. Surprisingly, I was able to possess you through the sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By possessing you, I can see the outside world again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How much was it worth to me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Child. You do not know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Rather, I am weary of the days spent in captivity this past decade. I’d like to see a bit of the world after my demise. Child, go out to the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order not to be taken lightly, I employed quite the pompous tone and expressed much dignity, but in truth my heart was racing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Sigh, can’t be helped. Fine. I’ll take a walk before dinner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, because you uttered those words, I got so excited I forgot all else and jumped for joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, you were so astounded your eyes shrunk to dots, but I was so happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I viewed the outside world for the first time in 15 years. It was nothing strange, simply the ordinary life of the peaceful imbecilic people in the Imperial Capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The peaceful world of humans that Hiro gained by defeating me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, none of it mattered to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just gained access to the outside world again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I witnessed people living their daily lives that day. And the sunset as it began to sink.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I watched the scenery, it seemed something unexpectedly got into my eyes, but I dare not show it to the child, so I desperately focused on my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child must have misunderstood something, as his expression seemed a little frightened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little relieved to be able to preserve the dignity of the Great Demon King, at least for a while longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Hmm? Child. The books that are stacked in the bookstore over there…… There’s also some promotion, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ What? Oh. ‘Destiny Grand Order’ released today…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That would be a foul. The sequel to a novel that I read on a whim on the pretext of ‘Knowing more about human culture would prove useful for something’ and unconsciously, I liked it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For sure, I want to see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized it, I had forgotten myself and asked the child to procure the book.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Haha!?” Why me!? Also, how will you read even if I bought it! You can’t touch books.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ You can turn the pages! Do not mock me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Th-that’s mean…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Aah, okay already. I’ll buy it for you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ A worthy cause!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I think about it, I was negligent. I lost all composure, dignity be damned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, either the child was simply stupefied or he began to doubt my being the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since then, he has not once granted me the courtesy deserved of the Great Demon King, and to even address me without using honorifics.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, for the first time in 15 years, the pleasure of spending time with someone was far superior. Therefore, I had no complaint or correction, especially to the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, it may be necessary to ensure the child’s mood never sullies, so I considered magic from the Great Demon Kings repertoire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave my utmost to acclimate to the child’s life, listening in on human school classes for the first time, and observing the lives of human students. All was fresh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as we continued our shared existence, I gradually came to understand the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A boy who grew up spoiled by a wealthy family without any inconvenience. However, it was also a rebellious period peculiar to puberty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, in the case of the child, it was not only defiance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After learning about the existence of the [Graduation Commemorative Match], I came to understand his situation clearly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ …… For the time being, I’m preparing myself for the humiliation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis much too lax, such lack of motivation, the extent of such slovenly attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis why I immediately understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That the child has a complex with his great parents.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking back on it, tis a natural story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The existence that overthrew me and changed the history of the world. A child born of such parents, the expectations and pressures he would have been under.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even more, tis a peaceful world now. Unlike the days of war, which afforded many opportunities to raise one’s name, it was cruel to have in mere students the same expectations as heroes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, such a thing does not matter to those around him. As the child is the son of Hiro, no matter what he does, he can only be seen through rose-colored glasses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite knowing full well of the child’s feelings, I chose to make a mockery of him for a moment. But in your heart… you want to get back at your father. You want to get back at the world. Is that not so? But I also understand that you lack the talent to do so.And.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child was pushed too far and had many rebuttals, I got much too heated and retorted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From there, it devolved to an argument exchanging one statement for another. In retrospect, I once engaged in verbal battle with Hiro, but it involved conflicting subjects such as “World”, “Humanity”, “Demon”, “Future” and so on. It was like a quarrel between young children.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the child said, ‘You actually weren’t that strong, were you?’. With that he said too much, and involuntarily I responded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — You shall take my place, wielding the power of the Great Demon King! And thus, be witness to my greatness as you blossom!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was that not surprising now that I think about it? Even the child was left petrified, his mouth wide open as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Train the son of Hiro, my former nemesis?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I almost laughed at my strange fate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, however, I also felt it would be a good way to kill time if nothing else and so what could be done about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During my life, never have I taught my skills or knowledge to someone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the sense that I can still have new experiences after death, even if the other party is The Son of Hiro, I will not dislike it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was simply to kill time. And yet, at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ You…… do not possess the aptitude for the same heavy-handed swordsmanship as Hiro. In other words, you lack the talent to be as Hiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to efficiently and effectively develop the skills through training suitable for the child, first explain the objectives of the training in order. For that purpose, he must learn what is unsuitable for his fighting style and what fits him best.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time, tis the same as asking him to give up on all he has ever aimed for, so to speak, to give up what had guided him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He gave up his father’s style, which he had longed for and aimed at since he was little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is why I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a 15 year old boy to be told that ‘you don’t have talent to be like your father’ , never did expect such a reaction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I-it’s not… Somehow, I have a rather pleasant feeling about this! Not like I’m my father’s son……exactly, more like I’m myself! I feel like a curse upon me has been reduced a little bit, and it made me feel better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child said so to me, earnestly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Please, Tre’ainar. Lead me to the right path.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child would not have noticed it either. At that time, the moment I heard those words, my astonishment was such that my face almost fell out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you understand? Hiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 People do not easily discard what they have accumulated or have been aiming for. If you put in the effort, pushed forward, and spent all that time on it, you would like to believe that it was not all for naught. To throw it away just by being told such by a person is, in a sense, a denial of the past self.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, so I made the proposal myself, and informed the child, ‘I don’t have the same talent as my father’, I assumed the child would disagree and turn rebellious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he did not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever words may come from your mouth, your focus up to this point, is always rooted to your dream and style. Rather that, I believe that it alleviates the burden… Do you know what that means?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than I thought, the child felt a complex with Hiro and Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the moment I found out, no longer did I think of it as nothing more than just killing time. For the sake of doing so, and having given up one way, I decided to make him as strong as possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — Skipping, one, two, three! One, two, three!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Bu, Gur, u… hehehehehe…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, certainly the child was so rude along the way that I lost count how often I got angry, but still not enough to have me say “I quit.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child also never uttered “I do not want to do it”. He obediently followed instructions put forth by me who should have been previously considered an enemy of the human race, and trained diligently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that day…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I…I couldn’t win, but I did my best…I don’t want any consolation! I want to win! I want to show them, those who don’t believe I can win!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the time, Hiro, Mamu, and the maid praised his attitude of “working hard to win the championship” in the upcoming match.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They may have just been praising him, but the child’s interpretation of their words was ‘they don’t expect a win’ from the beginning, rather than them caring about the results.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was no malicious intent from them as it were, they genuinely believed they were giving him support.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought of rectifying his outlook, but it did ignite the child’s enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Please…I want to train me more … No … I need to train! I want to be strong! I won’t discard it no matter what kind of effort. So, please! Osu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I judged that such fire was not to be put out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, having shown such enthusiasm, I began to believe in the result and decided to make him stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was at that moment, the child and I might have truly become master and disciple at last.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though we never put it to each other in words, at least for the child, for lack of anything else to do I train him, raise him as a disciple. To him I am not the Great Demon King, but a master diligently overlooking his growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is why, even though I was dead, I was also responsible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, when I realized the growth of my disciple, I felt even more enthusiastic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so did my feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Same could be said for the child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I don’t want to be an imperial knight. Right now I’m… I want to be a man who can go anywhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child opened his heart enough to tell me about his future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And whatever path the future leads to…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Someday…would you like to go? Not really. I’ve been taught a little bit, and… maybe I’d like to see it too… Including the demon world……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child was also aware that I would still be beside him on the road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Ho. The little boy, is in his own way…showing a man’s expression, is he not?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Is that right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — And, for that I am grateful. For now, it would be my pleasure, to see the world as it stands today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — Do our interests align?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — Hmm. Thus, you must get stronger. I will not have you perish the moment you embark on your journey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 — Yeah true. I ask that you please take care of me, Master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, tis a feeling I have never experienced before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, you might call it ‘humble’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child’s consideration, though not spoken out loud, was purely ingrained in the heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is why I deeply felt happiness with the child’s growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Hehe… This is my answer, Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ …… What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I’m here to prove myself, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just two months ago, he only had a sense of inferiority to the geniuses of the era, but now he wants to fight to prove himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I’m here, not the Great Hero, Hiro… not even Mamu, the War Maiden! Not even the son of a hero! I’m the one who’s here, me! Earth Lagann! And this is my way, starting here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart grew stronger, and more than anything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Pierce through the limits!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He acquired enough power to match it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Special Move, 【Fang of Heavenly Light • Meteor Flash Spir- uh… Uh, uh… Do iiiiiiiiittt!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Well, only the naming sense remains unfortunate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, the child’s achievements left me excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have led many in the past, but never have I raised anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tis not bad, this feeling as the student fully demonstrates their results and growth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Earth’s Fist caught Rebal!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Oh, Mr. Rebal!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Rebal fell…now, he’s face down on the floor!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ P-Powerful… Earth, so strong!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ What’s going on…a genius like Rebal can’t be left helpless on his hands and knees, right!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, with the crowd’s narrow-minded notion of ‘knowing his nature’ when it came to the child, their subsequent surprised reaction had me burst into laughter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I, I can’t believe it… that Earth, where did you learn that? When do you learn that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ With Hiro… me and… much less, it’s different from Sadiz. How the heck did he…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More than anything, the fact that you are incapable of masking your surprise proves my superiority. Say? Hiro. Mamu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You do not understand, do you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What happened to your son and why he gained so much power?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything is too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite the fact that I was completely destroyed by you and become but a spirit, this in a way, still verifies my existence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Wh-Why… Little man this… Those movements…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Celestial…the entire sword… Rebal’s swordsmanship is insane. I mean, to see it all… all Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Are you kidding me? Earth’s reflexes… And, uh… like wings… How do you move your feet?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ …… Hiro, di-didn’t you train him!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the sight of their surprised and dismayed faces, again I laughed at such ironic fate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, this is also something… You and I have faced each other on many occasions, but… Now we do not fight each other, we simply do the same thing… I am watching over the same man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And you , who should know your own son better than anyone else, know nothing, and now I know your son better…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I do not intend to act as intermediary between parent and child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you were the child, you would realize how little time you and your parents have spent with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I consider your attitude toward your son, perhaps there was a desire similar to that of ‘parents and children being connected by their hearts’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such could be said as the child’s fighting style was still ‘the same magic sword as his father’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the child forsaken all that. At the end of the day, he will not aim to be an Imperial Knight like you. He refuses to follow the path you have taken or the future you have prepared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Hiro. Mamu. What have you left to your son?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You have defeated me, gained world peace, the right to life of mankind, the future, and you have earned the title of one and only hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at this rate, will you not forfeit the ordinary ‘common happiness’ that is due a person?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really believed that it had nothing to do with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ He stood up! Rebal’s up!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ But, are you okay? You were beaten so much…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Even so, Earth is so strong…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Until now, you were saying that the Son of Hiro and Mamu would lose!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I knew that, didn’t I? Young Earth is a man who does it when he does it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Oh, that’s ridiculous!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Well, I’ve reconsidered it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Yes, it’s true—
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, even after doing this much… yet they still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Surely, the son of the hero!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hiro… Mamu… Do you not notice now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of praise the crowd send in admiration, and how calm the child’s heart is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though he smiles fearlessly at his opponent, his eyebrows twitch slightly at the audience’s remarks, and the reactions pull at the child’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I pushed his back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Even with this, seems the world still does not recognize you as ‘Earth Lagann’ instead of being the ‘Son of the Hero’. Then show me more. As my disciple, rouse the crowd. I will watch that moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a teacher, I was pushing the child’s back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ There is no winning…yes, not as it is now!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child’s voice and mine matches,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Child. I shall ask once again. Who were you before?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I used to be…the Hero, Hiro’s ……just his Son…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Then, who are you now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I’m your disciple…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Tis so, but as a disciple, have you no notion of your standing? The first and last disciple of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ And what will you be from this day forth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ It’s decided! New, and true me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Yes! Show it to everyone! Go, Earth!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And howl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the moment, I got so heated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Great Magic Spiral, Earth Spiral Break!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he clenched his fist tight. The child’s victory assured, I felt so much joy, and at the same time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Earth…you…… You!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ You… Why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reactions of the two who interrupted the match, and what happened afterwards, ached my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Is it true that the technique he just used was the Great Demon King Tre’ainar’s?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Idiot, why would the son of a hero use the Demon King’s skill!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ If that’s the case… it’s a shame!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ You have no pride as a son of a hero!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither those two nor Crowd appreciated the child’s efforts or results.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be inevitable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The technique of the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the point of view of the heroes and the humans who saw it, such reaction was only natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I should have been more concerned about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Distracted I was by the thought of my disciple getting stronger day by day, and he was not as distracted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of it because I lacked awareness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of it was my own fault.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet…… child…… You were a big fool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ You are at fault? Why would you say that? What’s wrong with me being your disciple?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Never will I forget those words. What kind of thoughts did you put into those words?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child who ran out on his parents, the Imperial City he grew up in, and everything in despair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You ran, wept, shouted, but never crawled, and you raised your head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And this time, not as the son of the hero, but as Earth Lagann, you will be recognized by the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Aim for the World, Earth!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Together, I swore to change the legend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ Okay… bring it on. I’m not an ultra hero, but…but still… let’s become ‘something’ that surpasses my father!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child also said so, laughed, and stood up again with hope and ambition, even though it was the worst day of his life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then let’s go together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ To the End of the World!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The child’s new life begins at the end beyond the horizon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, let us go as far as we can.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
