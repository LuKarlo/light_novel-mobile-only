 “There are even more books all of a sudden.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What are you saying! This amount is still but a few! In the first place, you can never read too many books.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I’ll read it with you next time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was one of the rewards I gave to Tre’ainar who made me his disciple. A follow-up of the novels that Tre’ainar loved reading when he was alive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, more than ten years have passed since Tre’ainar died, so when it comes to compiling all the following volumes, it ended up being a considerable amount.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I pulled the cart from the bookstore, returned to the mansion, and entered my room, I noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Originally, reading was not a hobby of mine, so my room doesn’t have a big enough bookshelf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The books on the bookshelf are also dictionaries, textbooks and the like.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, if by some chance I move these aside, Sadiz will get angry with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, where to put them… it can’t be helped, so in the closet maybe?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The closet located in the room. Or rather, it is a separate room that acts as a storage room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My clothes, social attire, childhood toys, and so on are in there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz usually cleans it for me, so I went in after a long time, but there was no dust, and it was neatly organized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is everything here yours?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, you can say that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, plenty of clothing and toys. After all, the child can buy it all without inconvenience.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Moh, Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know I’m blessed being in a wealthy family with plenty of luxury.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when people tell me, I feel like I’m being made a fool of, and I get a little upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis organized, but you no longer need anything from your childhood, do you? Why keep it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I agree with you, but Sadiz and my mother are no good… they are mementos…… or for when I have a child someday……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see. Memories…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what Tre’ainar laughs at.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In contrast to such a closet, Tre’ainar noticed something that was in there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Child. There are books on the shelf there…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He pointed to several books which were a little worn out, and left on a shelf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help feeling nostalgic, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, not my picture books. Wow~, Sadiz use to read these to me~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I knew they were there, but I didn’t have any need for them or take them out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if you take it in your hand casually and spread it out, the memories of the past come back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoho, tis a picture book?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. When I was little, I had them read this, and when I was in elementary school, we all acted plays together.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just Sadiz. At that time, my mother read it occasionally. My father was very bad at reading, so he didn’t like it, did he?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the play, the princess was so selfish and hard to deal with. I wouldn’t practice, something like practicing together as husband and wife so that I can monitor myself, well…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Oh, Peach Boy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when he saw one of the picture books I had in my hand, Tre’ainar whispered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, do you know about it, too? ‘Peach Boy Born from a Peach’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t share the topic of the novels, but I felt a sense of familiarity to the fact that Tre’ainar also knew the picture book I used to read.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Long ago, there was a man who was the natural enemy of the Ogres. His sword skills were superb, but what he feared the most was a beast-tamer with the power to persuade animals. With his ability, he led Cerberus and the Monkey gods to scatter the demons. He was a formidable opponent. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… wait what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh? That picture book… To the turtle who helped… Oh, the tale of the fisherman who journeyed to a deep-sea city? Nostalgic. Once, a schism ran between our Demon Army and the Legions of the Deep Seas over the princess, the daughter of the sea god.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… oh, hey?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmmm, this is… Ah, the bearer of the Battle Axe, ‘Golden Bear Killer’…… Well, once this was a problem involving interracial marriage, was this picture book story about the crane and frog woman who…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since when? Reading these kinds of picture books made my eyes shine with wonder, but as I grew up, I wrote them off as ‘stories for children’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Umm, Tre’ainar…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The characters in these picture books… were they real?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Did you not know?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never imagined I would find out in this way, not all of this was fictional, but actually “based on a true story.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is this one not famous, as well? ‘Tonchi One Nine’ was called the intellectual general of mankind. I often compared his wisdom with my own. And I miss this one too. ‘Old Sage Hanasaki’ the plant master who turned a land ruined by the war into an all-encompassing flower garden. Also… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait… Let me calm down first… Ha-ha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If anyone else said all this, I’d be like, ‘What are you talking about?’. But if the Great Demon King is speaking with a straight face, there was a persuasive feeling that it might all be true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This story… even if I were anyone else, no one would believe me …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know of a shocking fact, but surely no one will believe me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, in the first place, no one will believe my experience, that I see the ghost of the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, after meeting this guy, I was able to learn only things I didn’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what else is there? Such a story.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Alright…… Ah, this monkey named ‘Goku’ is -』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess more things like this will happen in the future.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
