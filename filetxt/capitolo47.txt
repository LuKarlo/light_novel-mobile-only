 How long has it been since Tre’ainar and I set off for something?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is something wrong?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, just a little… I wonder how long it has been since we left…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My teacher, my companion, and the existence that’s one with my flesh, Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing what I said, he was a little dumbfounded and laughed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Umm… tis only been three hours.』 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And yet I can’t see any signs of people at all! Or rather, where are we!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh. It had been about three hours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, I can’t see lights or anything, I’m just getting further into the woods and I’m getting scared of something, right? You want me to stay outside today? In that case, shouldn’t I have rested in the meadows still?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There was nothing around there. Neither water, nor anything that could prevent hunger.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-but…… well, then… I can’t sleep in bed today, or have a warm meal either…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, look here, pompous twit. For a penniless runaway you sure expect a lot?』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me and Tre’ainar, who started our journey from the expanding meadows, were now wandering in the forest at the foot of a mountain somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As far as the eye can see, every direction is surrounded by deep forests.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As we proceed, there is no village, not one hut, let alone the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My legs are tired, my stomach is growling, my throat is dry, I haven’t taken a bath, I have no bed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, without asking for anything, I can get everything without any inconvenience, and anything I ask for, Sadiz would… prepare… Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Damn it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, has your spirit broken so soon?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no … not really …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, this also is an experience I believe. Exactly…… I doubt the recent Academy students have learned how to camp…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By getting out of the environment you have been comfortable in until now, I can see how well off I have been in that environment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was in the Imperial City, and I, lamenting the circumstance that no one was looking at me, ran out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even if they would not acknowledge me, if I stayed in the Imperial City at least I would never starve or die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yet, since I abandoned it, I have to do everything on my own from now on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as I started my journey, I realized that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Anyway, think of this is an opportunity to hone yourself, so do not go through the forest carelessly, rather walk through the forest while considering all you have experienced. As you stay here, you shall gain self-sufficiency and follow the rules of the strong.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In other words, you have to secure food and bed for yourself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Secure a bed. Well, for some reason or another, I’ve resigned to camping outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t sleep in a soft bed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But securing food myself is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I mean… for example…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, finding mushrooms and edible plants, hunting beasts… catching fish, finding frogs and snakes…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A-Are you serious!? C-Can’t we find a steak shop!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Such is life, now on your feet!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How to put it, though I’m not a hunter, I must hunt beasts, I’m not a fisherman, but I must fish… Moreover, so gross!? Even a little, to eat a frog or a snake!? No, wait, I can’t! Frogs and snakes are really impossible!?” [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hence why you are your parents’ spoiled twit…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t help but be horrified by Tre’ainar’s words, that is too much for survival.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, Tre’ainar’s stunned expression seems to say, ‘With this level…’
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And being called ‘parent’s twit’ really stuck it to my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Raising your tone to that degree, will you think of the future? Furthermore, as I said earlier, in the forest… no, the outside world, tis the strong that eats. Do not forget, tis also possible you will be hunted by ferocious beasts and such, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is why you must be hearty in order to move on. Before our goals, we must first acquire the strength and knowledge to survive living alone.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right. At the time of our departure… well, the great feat of ‘surpassing my father’ that I pledged three hours ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I do that, I have to be man enough to do something about this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Tre’ainar’s words about me raising my voice to this degree, I’ll be considerate in the future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow… All right, I…… so…… ah, there was…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, when I glanced down, I noticed a large mushroom growing at the base of a tree, and crouched before that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I find something like this, I can eat it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, such bravery can discipline the mind, By the way, tis a poisonous mushroom called ‘Giggling Mushroom (Bakushotake)’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If consumed, dizziness, chills and neurological symptoms, and in some cases mental disorders such as visual and auditory hallucinations…』 [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, that’s too dangerous!? I had no idea, did I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Dangerous. If my hunger had reached the limit, I might have casually eaten this mushroom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With poisons being commonplace in the forest, acquiring food is a challenge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Well, do not worry. I shall inform you of survival in the forest. In times past, I would occasionally take a break in-between political affairs by going on a ‘solo camp’ retreat.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar speaking so freely is a new facet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything really is an ant to this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But why ‘solo camp’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By any chance, did he not have any friends… [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, we shall see what can be eaten and what cannot. So learn all you can.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If possible… I want to eat meat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wow, Tre’ainar’s expression is like, ‘Oh, this pompous twit’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m sorry. It’s what stimulates my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, anyway, as long as you’re in the forest… depending on the location, there are beasts and monsters… If you fight and win, you eat… you will need to learn that.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re serious…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not worry. And, as I have mentioned, you are in a period of growth. Rather, protein is a necessary nutrient. So, to you… I shall pass on a certain ‘Special’…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Special!? Tre’ainar’s Special!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “R-Really? The Tre’ainar Special? What’s that? Is there such a thing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not my invention. Tis to do with a certain tribe… a charm to lure beasts that does not require magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A charm that lures beasts? You don’t need magic? That’s what it is. Did he say… beasts?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you said beasts, if dangerous beasts show up…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not worry. There were no signs of such in this forest. At least, no beast stronger than the child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar stood on the spot, both legs slightly open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dassoso! Now, you do it!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… W-What’s that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a song and dance of the Banbino tribe that lures beasts. They are a famous hunting tribe.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Daso? Tre’ainar suddenly began to dance before my eyes, shouting out strange words…… Eh? [6]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? W-What’s that? …… no…… uh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not mock this? Capture the beasts that appear with this charm and dance!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sorry…… I gained resistance due to ladders and speed reading, and I guess it’s true if Tre’ainar says so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, to resist laughing, it’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a matter of life or death! Take it seriously! Now, rhythmically raise your voice with the steps you trained on the ladder!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oooh… is this it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, hop rhythmically on both feet, bend your hips slightly, shout with both hands to beckon!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But nothing came.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~ haah~ haaaah~… I used up my stamina…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dear me. The technique is simply beyond a spoiled twit.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stop calling me a twit, damn you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been screaming the same words and dancing for a long time, but no beasts came out at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar insists that I don’t have the skill, but…… No…… it’s what Tre’ainar says… but…… from the side, what am I doing alone in the forest?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah- ah… Better yet, if only I could say ‘Come here’ in words that are also transmitted to animals, wouldn’t it be easier…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was tired, so I sat down there and complained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to my casual grumbling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not…… infeasible!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar replied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『An Ancient Forbidden Spell… There is something that can aid in communicating with animals and demonic beasts. Translation Magic, 【Mutza Gouro】』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously!? Then, if you teach me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis too early for you. Best not to learn it yet.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s too early for me to learn. It’s not that I can’t do it, but the expression ‘It’s better not to’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have no idea what that’s all about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Tre’ainar tells me so with a serious, stern face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To understand all words… In a sense, that will lead to a change in one’s entire world view.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, most who have learned this end up mentally ill… best case scenario, you become a vegetarian.』 [7]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Well, seriously? Such a side effect?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not so much a side effect…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Tre’ainar thought a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, learn a lot. Then decide on whether or not the magic should be acquired after travelling the world a little more.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He told me about it just to admonish me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ladies and gentlemen, it’s been twenty-four hours. How are you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will also resume this story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t do it every day from here, but I’d be happy if you could still read it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chapter 2 flows from the prologue and the world after three hours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some of the impressions I received expected it to be “five years since then” and “ten years”, but the correct answer was “three hours”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a master and pupil, thank you again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H1] What? Were you expecting a One Piece Style 3D2Y Timeskip??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H2] The word used here is ボンボン which refers to a Green young man from a well-to-do family. Had a bit of trouble finding the word to use but thanks to suggestions from senpais at RTD and LNT Discord, I got suggestions including twat, prat but I went with Twit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H3] The word used here, ゲロゲーロ, has a double meaning which surprisingly works in either context. It can mean Gross or Disgusting (or simply a gag/vomit reflex), but it can also refer to the sound of frogs croaking (Gerogero).
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H4] Guess he found Shrooms!! Remember Kids… Don’t do drugs… Drugs are bad M’Kay!!!

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H6] Here we go again!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [H7] Oh Hell Nah! I don’t care what the beast says, Sads needs his meat. Whine about the Hens he’ll leave behind, dat chicken is getting in the fryer. I don’t care if it’s got a calf to take care of, beef is going on the grill. Fish gotta find Nemo? No need. He can join him in my stew.
