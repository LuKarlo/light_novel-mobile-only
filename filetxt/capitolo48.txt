 ─ No matter what, I’ll find Earth! I’m going out of the Imperial City, but Mamu should go back to the mansion right away just in case! Maybe Earth will drop in once!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having said that, Hiro ran out. To bring back our beloved son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I wanted us to run together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, as Hiro said, there’s a chance Earth might stop by the mansion once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His luggage and wallet, which were in the waiting room of the arena, were left behind after he ran off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He should have hesitated to rush out of the Empire without any money or possessions, so perhaps he returned to the mansion once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, those faint expectations collapsed the moment we returned to the mansion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He didn’t… come home…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I returned to the mansion, there was no particular change.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz cleans up every day, so nothing is messy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This morning, I’m sure she had done all the housework before coming to the Arena.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Mamu… uhm…… about Miss Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let her sleep in a vacant room. It would be troublesome if Sadiz were to wake up, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I quickly returned to the mansion and searched all the rooms, but they still couldn’t find him, and there was no trace of him stopping by.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized that, biting my lips in Earth’s clean, well-organized room, my subordinate warriors who I had left to care for an unconscious Sadiz finally caught up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in the end I couldn’t catch up with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth…… where the heck is… what the hell happened to you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even now, I want to believe that it was a dream.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Commemorative Match. Up to now, going by the academy teachers and Sadiz, Earth demonstrated fighting skills that are completely different from the expected hearsay, even displaying Martial Art without using a sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those movements, driven by power and technique far beyond our imagination, tossed Rebal, and then the skill he used at the very end…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… That’s not.… Right…… That’s what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, that’s not what I have to think about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right now it doesn’t matter why Earth is so powerful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All I have to think about more is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ If I knew it would be this hard… I would not want to be born as a hero’s child
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, uuuuh, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Has Earth been suffering from being our son, and we weren’t aware?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I heard such a story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he entered the academy, because he couldn’t beat little Phianse, and he had nothing special unlike Fu or Rebal, he developed a slight complex… ‘I’ve heard’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what did I do by just ‘listening’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was agonizing, he was frustrated, and he hated himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t stop crying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this room… packed with over a decade worth of Earth’s memories… I smell him just by being in this room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But he’s not here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is, everyday Sadiz, that girl keeps it tidy… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I saw the clothes hanging in the room’s closet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s an Academy uniform.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uniform… Come to think of it, when he started school, the size of his new uniform was a little big, and everyone laughed… Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I noticed that I was looking at the uniform.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Academy uniforms vary in size from student to student.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Earth said, ‘I’ll grow taller soon anyway’, and ordered a slightly larger size.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I happened to hear the story from Sadiz, so I knew the size of the uniform.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… it’s bigger than the large size I wore when I entered… Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is the size of the uniform changing? I didn’t understand it for a moment, but it was so simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth was growing, so the uniform wouldn’t fit, so I also put down a new uniform.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see… Earth…… you…… you’ve grown… so much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn’t know that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I didn’t even notice it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why didn’t I notice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I wasn’t looking at Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… even that… I didn’t see it… I didn’t realize…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I disqualify as a parent…… naturally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So… what are you suffering from…… what are you worried about… I didn’t even know what was going on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if you don’t usually see each other very often, aren’t you connected because you are parent and child?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt connected, yet I didn’t see anything… what we say with our mouths.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, no matter what our children will be okay… hah… what are you saying, I…… I only saw Earth as an impression of myself and Hiro. Earth is different from me and Hiro. Earth… is Earth, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ─ I’m just… just once… my dad… everyone… not as a son of a hero. I just wanted you to praise me… that’s all…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My own son… my beloved son… for him to say that… no…… we made Earth say it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did Earth say that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this way, finally…… to realize that I lost Earth…… What a hero! What a hero!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… Earth…… sorry…… I can’t even be a normal parent… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Save the world… saying it’s work, it’s protecting the world of peace… I couldn’t protect the happiness I had in my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man! Haa, ha… Lil’ Earth!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, before my startled presence at the roughly opened door, stood Sadiz, who looked pale and trembling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Miss Sadiz. You need to take a little rest now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seems she came right away after waking up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the voice of my subordinate has not reached Sadiz now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz also recalls a lot, and then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mamu… Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… He gave up on us and ran away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I couldn’t recall the words I just said to Sadis, her whole body trembling and stumbling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s all on me and Hiro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… what…… screaming…… Little man… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can understand painfully what Sadiz is thinking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For today… alone… I made a silent effort… for Little man… I, I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For my own sake, I am bound by a feeling of regret and guilt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if you sit down crying to death… he’s not coming home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… ah… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not the time to cry. Sadiz too. Me too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I regret it and cry but… my legs move, so… me and you… Hiro, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ma… am… Big sister…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if they won’t let me… I’ll think about making amends, but for now I’m going to chase after them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to chase after him now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter where it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t Earth coming home!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nowhere in town… why don’t you go back home!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it’s noisy again… these kids…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phi… Princess… Fu…… Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lady Mamu, now… the entire Imperial Capital is on high alert and under curfew… so I searched all over the city… but he’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her face turned blue… the princess doesn’t know what happened, but she can’t settle down to the fact that Earth is gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about it, I know how she feels… so I, Hiro, or Solja… If you can, take Earth… at that point, it’s no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we, unqualified parents who saw nothing of Earth, were to join Earth and this child… once, I thought that we, who were united like family as the Seven Heroes, could be a real family…I was simply thinking, ‘We are happy’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Umm, Lady Mamu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… where in the world… why…… like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu and Rebal are breathless. The two grown-ups, now as anxious as children, are now worried about Earth. Rebal, even though he hasn’t gotten any treatment for the injury from the match yet, is running around desperately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s the same for these two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I and Hiro heard that they were developing the same kind of talent as ‘Them’, not knowing anything about Earth, but were motivated to compare him to these two…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know. Where did he go?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So! …… I have to know… I mean, Earth… again…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a parent, I’ve made a mistake that is beyond reproach.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Holding on to that, we still have to meet Earth again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… I want to see you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not a lie. Because I love you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth. You may not forgive me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it’s too late, you might reject it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I still… one more time…… really this time…… I want to be your mother!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how long it takes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once again a huge shout out to my patrons for their overwhelming support to my stuff! Glad you love enough to toss a coin…
