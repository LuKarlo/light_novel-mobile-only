 『In such a forest, one can only hunt down the beasts that flee. Set a trap. Drive with a bow and arrow or a spear. But other than that…… to chase and catch them myself… such means exist.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for the speed of the beast and those with small bodies, they avoid the trees with agile movement and disappear into the depths of the forest without suffering from the obstacles at their feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn’t it impossible to catch up with a beast in the forest?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『So. Available footings are unstable with obstacles aplenty. Then what are you to do? Search for the path of light.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The path of Light?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The shortest route to the destination or goal. Tis an application of dynamic vision and peripheral vision, which until now has only been active in sparring and speed reading. The ability to detect the shortest route to the goal while avoiding obstacles, by measuring ‘your own physical ability, passiveness, foothold situation and risk assessment, using experience, prediction and the ability to observe and understand surrounding conditions. The skilled person sees the situation in an instant while running, and the shortest route in which to advance to the target appears as a path of light… A Shining Road…… such is the phenomenon.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shortest route. Considering my current physical abilities?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How about that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have done it by nature, like walking through a crowd in the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to do it in this deep forest……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, even if you find the shortest route, tis not that easy considering your physical abilities. Therefore, in this forest, in addition to survival knowledge, you shall learn the techniques of running, climbing and flying, jumping and traversing using trees and surrounding terrain, running through narrow paths… You shall acquire ‘Magical Parkour’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical Parkour. Although the naming is still the same, the technique is certainly convenient… and cool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of obstacles being a hindrance, they move lightly from tree to tree, kick off rock walls that appear, and use the recoil to accelerate further.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, tis so. Once you master this, moving in the forest is easy. Furthermore, tis also possible to use the roof of buildings to move around the city. Tis a technique used by ‘Ninja Warriors’ once known as the world’s best covert group.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ninja Warrior. I knew the name, but I didn’t know the details.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mysterious warriors who are said to have contributed to the war effort from the shadows in all aspects during the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know who played what role or how, but rumors still sparked rumors and ninja warriors were called ‘Heroes of the Shadows’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a kid, I honestly thought that was ‘stylish’, but after all, no one knew the true story, so it gradually slipped into obscurity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I didn’t think I’d get to learn the technique that ninja warriors use.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magical Parkour used by ninja warriors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was running in the forest to learn by all means.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rabbiiiiiiiiiiiit!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hunt, to catch the escaping rabbit nimbly running around with its small body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I hate snakes and frogs, but I’ve eaten rabbit meat! Rabbits I can eat! Waaaaaaaiiiit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, do not get too eager. Parkour needs calm. Get hot and try to do more than your ability to, and you may end up in an awkward state?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It tries to run through the bushes and throw me, but I won’t let it get away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to eat more meat than mushrooms!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve eaten rabbit meat in a restaurant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had a slightly wild flavor, unlike beef-pork, and I thought it was good enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not going to let you go, rabbit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And here! With that in mind, I flew from branch to branch and there …eh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha bah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… On the branches of the tree… hit by the shin of both feet…… misjudged the distance…… What?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m faaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I-I’ll die!? Both shins hit!? I-I’m gonna die! Gyaaaaaah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Heb, Goh, Gaha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Falling, the back of the head! Back, ass!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaga, oh, goa…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Therefore, do not push your good fortune too far…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The distance between the branches of the tree was a bit longer, but I thought I could reach them… I didn’t reach them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I banged the tibia which faced both feet on the branch of a thick tree, fell from the branch as it is, and crashed to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hit my back and buttocks hard and rubbed my body with thickets.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey… you have not perished, have you? If you die with just this, you will be quite the dullard, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S-Sorry… Damn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No good. I can’t get up right away because my whole body is numb.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rabbits… Oh…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That rabbit… stopped and looked back at me… What? Are you laughing with your nose?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rabbit turns around and looks at me, who can’t stand up and give chase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no sign of the rabbit running away any longer either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It didn’t laugh, but for some reason I felt I was being made a fool of.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah, let’s go…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like I was being made a fool of, so I stood up to be mean.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the rabbit shook its body and began to focus so that it could start moving at any time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I see the rabbit, and at the same time I understand it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terrain… no good…… this distance…… even if I jump out, it can run away as it is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood only because I was chasing it up to now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its mobility. Agility. And, a sharp turn.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unfortunately, I couldn’t use a breakthrough because of magic preservation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t knead my magic well because of the pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good grief, how hopeless I am.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal brought down a dragon, but I can’t even catch a rabbit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t make light of it… this struggle… you catch it, you win… if that’s the case!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gradually get numb but can move somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it cannot be caught though it moves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dassoso”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Eh?!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rabbit reacted. All right, one more time!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dassoso”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………eh……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The technique taught by Tre’ainar. A dance that lures beasts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was embarrassing at first, but I was cornered up to this point, and I was hungry, and I couldn’t live if I didn’t eat anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, shame does not matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dassoso”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I opened my heart and invited the rabbit with powerful steps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, what did it do?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rabbit moves its ears, and it approaches me as if it were a drunk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-It worked!? Seriously!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho. By opening your heart, you finally achieved it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I didn’t feel ashamed of this, so I took it seriously and invited it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That thought attracted the beast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This…… The art of living……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I got iiiiiiiiiiit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I quickly caught the rabbit that came to my feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a little hairy, heavy, hot, and you even hear the sound of the heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is…… Life……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, caught one at last? It took a long time.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… finally…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I live by eating this. Somehow, it’s kind of emotional…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now then, clean it up, drain the blood, peel off the skin, and remove the internal organs…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What is it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… uh…… That!…… I’m gonna do it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, n-no way… um…… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well I never, do you mean to imply you find such task disgusting, I wonder?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, still, eh? Can’t I just grill it as it is?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m dismantling? eh? Why take out the internal organs? Intestines…… can’t bare it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Absolutely… Are you sure? Even if you catch a rabbit, it remains a rabbit. From now on, you have to make the rabbit meat in order to eat it… that is your task.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Seriously…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is why the one who has only eaten meat that has already been processed by the butcher is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, still mocking me as the ‘twit’ with a look of disdain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t help it, but I’ve only eaten what became meat in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve only eaten meat cooked in restaurants, not to mention the butcher’s meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have to slaughter this rabbit by myself, and dismantle it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two more rabbits appeared from behind the bush.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, I glance at them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh, and… eh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I stare, the two do not run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me… No…… It’s like they’re staring at a rabbit I’m holding by its neck…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No way…You’re not a parent and child, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey. Do not mind it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I don’t think I’m going to…Stop it, don’t look at me like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Although, you have family, I still need to eat. I can’t stay alive otherwise…so—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, no matter how close you are, I’ll eat this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no need for sympathy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a matter of life or death.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been eating animal meat for years now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, the rabbit that I caught with half-hearted sympathy……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kuu …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is useless even if it looks with such round eyes. Your family is over today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come on, dismantle now …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh… G-Go… You can go! The rabbit I met on the beautiful starry night…… I’ll name you Shooting Star.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, something came up, and I let the rabbit that I caught go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I lowered it to the ground, the rabbit dashed down to the other two, and without looking back at me, the three of them went deep into the forest…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Be strong… and, get along with your family… Shooting Star Family…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You let it gooooooooooo!!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, even though he couldn’t touch me, Tre’ainar struck me with his arm penetrating my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, because…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Because nothing! What was that? Being kind?! Are you aware that tis the ultimate hypocrisy to show such half-hearted welfare to animals, even though you are not a vegetarian?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I-I know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You know not! Are you sure? Tis natural in the animal kingdom to be caught by the strong and become sustenance. Survival of the fittest, such is the way, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『War is the same, is it not? That is how the human race won the right to survive.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, yes. I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I just… Family…… if it gets caught and I noticed……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dear me… with this, I worry for the future…… in the end, all you could yield were mare mushrooms … Uh!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar, who was preaching to me, suddenly glanced deep into the forest with a scary face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m trying to guess what’s going on, but I still don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hey…… child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… A little unexpected…… something dangerous that cannot be eaten… seems he was in this forest.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, the trees in the forest shook and felt a sign of ‘something’ approaching little by little with a noise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time…… I heard the sound of something crashing ‘three times’.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
