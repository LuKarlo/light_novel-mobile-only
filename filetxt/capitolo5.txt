<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both my parents were commoners.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems they were childhood friends who attended the academy together, then were both chosen as members of the Hero party…… Well, some things happened, they got married and I was born.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a word, this elegant mansion was built after their marriage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, there is a spacious exhibition hall in which a lot of weapons and magical tools both ancient and modern are usually locked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Inside, there are swords and armor that are placed in a showcase or displayed on the walls.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is probably as a hobby that my father, a magic swordsman, acquired numerous weapons after marriage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He claims to have mastered all kinds of martial arts, but I’ve never seen my father use a Spear or a Halberd before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there in the far end of the armory-like exhibition hall, there is a foreboding thick door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is a space that can only be opened once a year, wherein lies the treasure which changed the history of the world and saved humanity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then, Little Man. While I retrieve some rags, do go inside and reclaim your childhood. If you want to steal it, please do your best. Well, it’s impossible for a half pint to pull out the sword that’s sealed on the pedestal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not stealing it! It’s… well…… I wonder what it will be like to see it now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz tells me with a smile. I felt awkward, but I unlock the door with the key I received.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The room within spreads out to a perfect square floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the floor a pentagram magic circle is drawn, and in the center is a sword stuck in a pedestal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… The Sword of the Hero…… The strongest in the world… Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A room that is only released once a year. I wasn’t here last year or the year before, so I’ve come into this room for the first time in a few years and looked at the sword…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of the sword, I was looking at something else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… the door opened… I see, tis been a year… how many now… about 15 times…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not my own words. There should be no one within the sealed room because it is usually locked and no one can enter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I entered, there was already someone there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmmm!?? This one… ah…… Hiro’s progeny… was but a toddler, but now a little grown-up and resembles Hiro.』 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, who are you!! Why are you here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait, why are you surprised?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, he’s not human!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Long, silver hair. Sharp and majestic devil horns that extend from the head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The medieval beauty form that could be as both man and woman with a suspicious pattern engraved around the eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A mysterious demon dressed in a purple robe that covers the whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I raised my voice and prepared myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Oi…… well, I never… child…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Can you hear my voice? Do you recognize my presence?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-What the hell are you saying! Wait, how did you get into this room? Are you a demon? A robber!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What!? How has this occurred… by no means…… has something changed in my fifteen years of solitude?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fifteen years? What’s this guy talking about? No matter how you think about it, he doesn’t seem to be tangible, and yet I feel a strange presence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy isn’t normal!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… you’re noisy. Did you actually try to pull out the sword?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz! Watch out, there’s some strange guy here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Sadiz heard the commotion and came in holding some cleaning supplies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is no a problem with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although Sadiz is a maid, she has graduated from the Academy with excellent grades and is qualified as a 【Superior Warrior】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why she is content with being my exclusive maid, but when I was a kid, she was as talented as my personal escort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With both Sadiz and I, no matter who this guy is, he’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man, there’s no one there…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You’ve been a virgin for so long that you’ve finally started to hallucinate with your delusions… Oh dear…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was surely able to see the demon within the sealed room, but the fact that nothing was visible to Sadiz shocked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? What, why? He’s there, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lil’ Earth, please give up on this strategy. Trying to scare me into pushing you down to get intimate is meaningless. So, please remain a virgin for a while longer.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, it’s not that!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I still have preparations to make. Please don’t make too much noise, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She really can’t see him? Sadiz left in preparation for cleaning again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Apparently…… the only one that can see me… child… is you …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha…!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even so…… When I had a body, I had lived for tens of thousands of years, but… it brings me some joy to have a conversation with someone for the first time in a dozen years… I am frail… under the circumstances I would lose to humans…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is he stupid? No way, I’m the only one who sees him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Confined to this cramped space… the only intrusion is during the yearly cleaning… for such an occurrence, what does it mean? Mischief from god? Well, either way… tis all about you… my instinct tells me. Even though I was obsessed with this sword, but… child, you are curious as well!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis ironic, but… in a sense, a stroke of good fortune. I could see nothing of the outside world because this sword had not left this room since I was overthrown. Huhahahahaha!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, W-What is this? Hey, what the hell is with you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the demon approached me, trembling with a smile mixed with ecstasy and madness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stay away! No matter who you are… I know you’re listening! You wanna get beat up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I picked up the mop that Sadiz had placed in preparation for cleaning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I held it like a sword, further increasing its power by imbuing lightning magic that I excel in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… 【Magic sword】… but…… tis unrefined… mediocre… a far cry from Hiro’s prowess.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!? Y-You…!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so engrossed that I swung at the demon. However, the demon, who I thought got hit, without doubt slipped through my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis no use. Your attack is meaningless to a spiritual body. However, tis you who is fortunate as all that remains is a spiritual body.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the…!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『With this level of magic sword, even if you train for a hundred years, you would not even be considered an enemy during the era I was active.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wha. …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No matter, you shall be in my care from now on. I shall give you my name.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I threw up as the demons looked into my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I am ‘The Great Demon King Tre’ainar’…… he who once sought to conquer the world, but was slain by your father and his companions.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The modern world that was lost to me… I shall see it through you, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, I lost consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Enter the Great Demon King! I decided to have him use a more sophisticated speech pattern. Light Shakespearean speak (like using “tis” instead of it’s) and more high born vocabulary. So yeah, to the THESAURUS!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Ooooh $%#@! Here we go again! The Great Demon King, the titular “Master” is literally named “Trainer”. So I played around with the name to make it look more foreign!
</div>
