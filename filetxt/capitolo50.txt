<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I look deep into the forest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I couldn’t tell because of the gloom of the night, but I could see a large black mass slowly approaching me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know what it is yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But one thing I know is… Huge!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its shadow is like a large boulder in the forest, and yet it is…… bipedal!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child… cease your stupor… prepare to move with haste.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Osu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be careless. Be ready to activate the breakthrough at any time.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar warns me to stay vigilant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As long as you enter the forest with the beast, you’re next to something dangerous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A beast of that size… a bear?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No…… What? The shape of the shadow has finally come to light. Hmm? You know, aren’t there two sharp corners that extend from the head?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you… a human?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It spoke!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s late, what’re you doing here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, human? No, it’s not. But it can talk to people……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the identity of the huge approaching mass was finally revealed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Red-blackish skin over its whole body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It has a furry waist wrap, but everything else is exposed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The big mass is not obese, but composed of huge bulging steel muscles all over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The two horns extending from the head are a sign of a deformity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, a bag which contains ‘Something’ is carried on its shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This… it’s an Ogre.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At Tre’ainar’s words, tension rose all over my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Among the demons, it is said that it is a ferocious race with high fighting ability.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Intelligence is not so high, but possessed enough supernatural power to make up for it. I heard that they always stood on the front line during the war of tens of years ago, plagued the Allied forces, and attacked a lot of towns and nations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a sense, for humanity, they are popular and scary demons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see, where’s yer home… kid?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, the other reason why they are most feared and hated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its merciless cruelty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘I’ve heard’ that non-combatants, such as women and children, are also brutally slaughtered and violated in the cities they have conquered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Could it be, you lost?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It looked a little surprised at my appearance, but it was approaching.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What am I doing? Can’t lose my never here!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D-Don’t come any closer!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I might be a kid, but… you’re not looking down on me, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was stunned for a while, but when Tre’ainar told me to ‘move with haste’ I braced myself right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While taking a step, I assumed the stance of the Great Demon Flicker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I do, can the Flicker penetrate this guy’s bulging brawny muscles?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, then I’ll lead it around with my speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Against those with pointless gargantuan bodies, it is best to take them on with speed……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H-Hey, c-calm yer spewing! Oh, I won’t do nothing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, don’t make such a scary face!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell? Suddenly, the Ogre with an impatient expression, is trying to calm me down?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is no joke! Is it trying to get me off guard? Are you going to eat me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, not even a filthy ogre… with my Breakthrough…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wait… child…… this is a tad peculiar.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah! What are you talking about?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This ogre… does it truly intend to fight? I feel no evil intent…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh? Hey, the opponent is an ogre, right? Can you believe it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No… But this is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar is holding his mouth from beside me, but only at this point, I couldn’t trust it right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The existence of a ‘demon’ other than Tre’ainar that I’m meeting for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the infamous Ogre tribe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why you’re in a place like this, but I don’t know if I can stay calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s it. Well, yer hungry and frustrated, aren’t you? Then, I’ll let you stay in the house. Hmm, I’ll feed you even!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Are you taking me lightly? I won’t fall for such words? What? Are you going to fatten me up?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eat. N-Not that! You, human, yer eating! Oh, I don’t do nothing bad ta humans!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do I do? Strike preemptively for a swift victory? If I get caught like that, it’s over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or escape with a breakthrough……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child… listen when I talk.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The intense angry words from Tre’ainar, who was by my side, made me think he was scarier than the ogre in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… ah…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did Tre’ainar get so angry? I didn’t know what was going on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-Why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I told you. This ogre is… it really has no will to fight. There are no evil intentions either. Child, you worry me, being so purely lost.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Or you… never having seen it before with your own eyes …do you judge the existence of this ogre purely on the prejudice of ‘People’ you have not seen with your own eyes?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t judge only by preconceptions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, I’m meeting an ogre for the first time and I’ve only heard about the dangers through rumors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now, for me to regard it like that, Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hey, child. Do you not know?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Just a few hours ago… a man who can only see himself under the title of son of a hero… was insulted as a disqualified warrior with regards to the circumstances only for using the technique of the Great Demon King… do you not know that there was such a sad man?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And here… is a person who can only be seen as a member of the ‘Ogre’ race, though it shows concern for you and it is kind. Well…… what do you think?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I heard those words, my face became hot and I was ashamed of myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was fed up with everyone seeing me only with the title ‘Son of the hero’ and now I’m dealing with the guy who has no ill will or evil spirit that appeared in front of me only by the race of ‘Ogre’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just my father, my mom, or the people of the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shamelessly, I had the same narrow heart as everyone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oooooooh, gah!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, a-are you okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so ashamed that I was hitting my head against a tree right next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lame… I’m so naive… absolutely lame…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Tre’ainar hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have noticed. I could not help feeling annoyed with myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sorry… for sure…… I was wrong… Tre’ainar…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, having apologized, I will not think too much of it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Tre’ainar smiled gently at my apology and waved to the ogre in front of me with his chin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I don’t know what this guy is, why he’s here, or if he’s really worried about me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But still, first of all, without a strange preconception…… no, it is the first demon I’m meeting for real. It might be impossible to connect with the other party on friendly terms so suddenly, and honestly it’s scary.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe if I get careless, he can crush me in an instant just by grabbing my head. Break my neck bone. He looks that strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But first, I go towards the ogre who’s worried about me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-I’m sorry… all of a sudden, I was yelling at you… you’re right, I’m lost, I’m hungry, I’ve had a lot of things… no…… I was simply a narrow-minded idiot, so I said all that… My bad…… Forgive me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With my head bleeding a little, I bowed to the ogre in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I usually don’t bow to people very often, but at this point I knew that ‘no matter how anyone sees me, I’m in the wrong’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the ogre in front of me……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, but I’m not like that. Well, I’m an ogre, so people can’t not be afraid. It happens.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, the terrifying Ogre’s expression showed me a full smile, as if he was a daring neighbor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a smile that made me feel something, I was shaken and at the same time I felt more ashamed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s real late today. Come ta the house. I’ll show you how ta get ta town in the morning!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… Oh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, hehehe. Human, I was inviting you ta the house anyways. Well, I just got some ‘meat’ a while ago, so let’s eat it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, the ogre not only forgave me, but he’ll try to help me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at Tre’ainar’s face next to me, he nodded without saying anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, what’s yer name, human.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Name? I…… Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. Earth… yer a good guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, people I’ve met so far, they’re all scared. But I believed in Earth. Ah, I’m glad ta be friendly with a human!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop … I was being extremely hostile, me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This ogre…… a ridiculously nice guy… eh? Is this really an ogre?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh well, Aka. I’m called Aka Naiter. Nice to meet you, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t feel like I’m in contact with a different tribe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s much better than those guys who know me only as ‘the son of a hero’. It was full of human kindness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the encounter between me and the strange ogre, Aka.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
