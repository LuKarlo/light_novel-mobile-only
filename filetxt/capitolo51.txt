<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the middle of nowhere…… rather, it was more like a hideout.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a small open space beyond the dense forest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a house made of wood there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a small house. Earth, is little, so it should be good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-Is that right. But, little is too much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a huge ogre’s house, so certainly the doors and the height of the building are big.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, there were some fields around the house, and the hoes and so on for the farm work were bigger than my body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Mr. Aka, do you live alone?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah, I live alone.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Alone. Apparently. He’s completely self-sufficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, there are animals in the forest, and if I can grow vegetables like this, I wonder if I can live alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Earth… what’s ‘Mistah’ Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? No…… what…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the heck? Is it weird to have ‘Mr.’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, by all appearance I can only see you as a senior, and to discard it feels a bit awkward to me… oh, speaking in a polite manner is better than casual talk…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He might be gentle, but I don’t have the courage to refer this strong ogre casually… let’s not do that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you assume to use ‘Mr.’ for those of higher station, why do you neglect it in my case?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… ah… no…… so, is Mr. Tre’ainar better?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『………… No, tis adequate as is. We are past the point to standing on formality… Eerie! You acting so reserved at this late hour leave me feeling eerie!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then don’t say that. Well, I also don’t feel right when I call out ‘Mr. Tre’ainar’ at this point, so I’m saved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka… That’s good. Mr. Aka… Yes, I like it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Clasping his hands together, Mr. Aka was satisfied with how he was referred to by a junior, or should I say somewhat delightfully laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I like this honorific. Well, make yerself at home. Now, I’ll make a meal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Aka let me into the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There isn’t much furniture.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there’s an open kitchen, a decking desk and chair in the middle of the room, and on over it there’s a carved wooden statue and stone decorations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This… This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s poor, if I say so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No… it’s okay, but…… is this Aka’s handmade work??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh. I’ve made a lotta things when I play around in my free time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little embarrassed, Mr. Aka was fumbling his words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this goddess statue or something… I mean, it’s kind of elaborate. The quality is…… amazing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The gentle expression that makes you feel the motherhood of the beautiful goddess, each feather on the angelic wings on her back are finely detailed… he even reproduced the wrinkles of clothes and so on…… how do you carve this with such blunt fingers? Or, is she the demon’s goddess? No, it may be prejudiced, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you like it, I’ll give it to you if you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N-No, no, no, I don’t mean to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By any chance, did he think I was greedy eyed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as I denied it in a hurry, Aka, who stood in the kitchen, became a bit despondent…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… it’s bad isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To accept this… you can’t right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, huh? What? Is it a shock that I didn’t accept?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, maybe it’s etiquette to accept when he says ‘I’ll give it’ or something like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not hesitate, take it, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar muttered in my ear, now I’m confused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This Aka ogre might have lived isolated from others. As such, he is glad to have someone receive something.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What? He’s happy to be kind to people and give things… Is there such a guy?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not so… I believe he is glad when others are appreciative. When people appreciate you… tis like having them recognize your existence.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is it like that? Are you glad to be appreciated by others?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know. I’ve been… I’ve never been thanked for my existence… But I guess that’s a way to be acknowledged, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「But is it okay? Don’t you think I’ll look greedy?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, it may depend on the person, but speaking of this Aka fellow…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, it’s the first time I’ve met him. How do you gain something on top of that when you take care of everything from room to meal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but it’s what Trainer says, and Aka is a bit embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then… I wonder if I’ll get this stone necklace…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, the statue is elaborate. However, even if you receive such a thing, it would be bulky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that respect, if it is a stone carved necklace, it is easy to carry, and he will not think that I am greedy because it is small…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure sure. You can have it! See that shelf ov’r there? The necklaces are there! Take as many as you like!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N-No, just one… ah, no… you have so many pieces to display.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was true. The moment I said I would take it, Aka laughed so joyfully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now he started working in the kitchen with a humming song.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’ll make a meal then.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, Aka was in the kitchen. Kitchen knife? Isn’t that a big sword? No…… It’s as big as Rebal’s Bastard Sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was surprised…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, hmmfu-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So fast! And, lively! He took ‘something’ out of the bag he had a while ago and prepared ‘it’ really fast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In an instant, he plucked the feathers… is it meat?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. That is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… pfft… truly…… unexpected…… to say the least…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar seemed to be thinking of something, but I don’t know what it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Mr. Aka immediately threw what he was working on into a huge frying pan and lit the fire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no… the smell is so good……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Gulp…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My throat rang involuntarily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, Aka takes out some of the vegetables from the basket on the kitchen floor and cuts them out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that…… it’s exciting, but…… but it’s not messy. Rather, there is a glimpse of civility.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve watched Sadiz cook a few times, and I get a different impression when she’s cooking accurately without any waste, but this is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm-hm-hm ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oooh, it’s sizzling, right? Is that it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such hospitality, will you suddenly serve steak?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, Earth, will you eat rice, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, this, rice?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With such super savory fragrance that makes you eat this deadly food, you want to add more rice?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, yes. If you wanna eat it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Then, let’s fry the rice with the gravy served in the meat grilled…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eeeeeeeeeeek! I surrendeeeeeeeeeeerrr! Is there justiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!??
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heave-ho, heave-ho, now go on, eat up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, ooooh, s-steak, boned meat, grilled rice, salad platter… ah…… fish…… oooooooh!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, don’t be a glutton. I was told not to behave badly… well, I’ll put my hands together, but, uh, the steam is on my nose… hah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then, I gladly accept this meal… Gab…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m all over the fried meat…!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-What the hell is thiiiiiiis?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel the juice that came out at the same time as the crisp texture explode in my mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no good, savor the taste, that one? That? Before long, I’ve only got bones!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-I can’t believe it, wh-what is this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? This? Cow? Birds? Pork? It’s different, and it’s a little bit wild, no, but this is such foul-play!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… uh, Earth. Yer surprised…my cooking is too bad…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that? Hey, what’s that troubled face?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? You’re an unmindful bastard, aren’t you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s that uneasy face?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like Fu, who showed powerful magic with a small face and said, “Are you so surprised that my magic power is so weak?” What’s this!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… oooooooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This steak, wow, the meal! Rice, rice, riiiiiiiiiiice!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-This is foul-play, it’s d-delicious!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no, don’t, don’t cry now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until now, when I got home, I didn’t have to ask for anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking to Sadiz in advance, she made whatever I wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t do that from today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ran from home, forced to self-sufficiency, gathered mushrooms, and finally ran around trying to catch Shooting Star only to set him free out of sympathy. I was hungry, frustrated, and I never thought I would eat anything decent in my situation. This banquet is unfair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t stop my tears anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s delicious, so good, it’s good, Mr. Aka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s good. Oh, there’s still more ta come! It’s the first time someone says it’s delicious! Thank you, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So why are you thanking me, you bastard!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My words didn’t come out due to tears, so I nodded many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Behave yourself… and be grateful for your life, child. In any form… the flesh, is life…… because it became a part of you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was saying something difficult, but I just got hooked and ate the meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, would you also like some soup?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is no use moving my mouth except to eat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of answering with my mouth, I sent a peace sign to Aka with all my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Aka was actually delighted, and returned a peace sign while a little embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ogre’s piece sign was pretty surreal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will always be indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sorry I didn’t return my impressions easily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m watching it all, but it takes time and patience to give it back…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aside from that, I saw the impression column of the previous story, and tilted my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe you’re reading too deeply about tragedy and dark developments.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I met on a night with lots of stars. So, shooting star.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ‘red’ demon who met in the middle of the ‘night’. That’s why, Aka Naiter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Excuse me…… What do you expect from Aka????
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, more than 60,000 drills. Thank you, everyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once again, thanks for the support. And I really hope everyone is safe and healthy. As a bonus, yatta! (sorry for the cringe 😔)
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, [I scanlated the first chapter of the manga] (insert praise effect). Thank you, thank you but unfortunately I have bad news. I’m not going to do anymore (insert boos and hisses). Sorry but it’s a lot for just one dude, especially a noob like me. Hopefully it’ll garner attention from others enough for a pro group to pick it up (do spam your favorites with requests).
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I hope you enjoy it and share it around. Till the weekend!
</div>
