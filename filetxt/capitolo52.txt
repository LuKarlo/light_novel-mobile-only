 “Burp… what a meal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good, I ate every dish one after another as they came out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t hold back, I was in a trance and greedily devoured it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve licked even the juice that was left on the plate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, yeah. I’m glad ya ate plenty. Now, have some tea and relax.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Mr. Aka, full and calm, and even a warm tea… No, I’m not afraid of ogres anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the horns were growing on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, his face is scary, but he’s so kind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the war is over now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you… really…… you saved me, Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh. If ya say it like that, thank ya.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that logic is strange! I wanted to put out that retort a hundred times over, but Mr. Aka seemed really happy, so instead I laughed and nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a good dish, Mr. Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so? Oh, I’ve been cooking for over ten years, so I’m good at it. But this was the first time I had someone ta feed, so I was a little nervous.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While having a sip of tea, I asked a little about Aka’s statement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “More than a decade? Mr. Aka… Have you lived here this whole time?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The flow of the story was simple and interesting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, but this may be a ‘would rather not answer’ situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I suppose so, considering Aka seemed a little sad and somewhat dismayed at my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Most likely a former soldier… he may have been a part of some unit. I do not know though.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh! Tre’ainar?!」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ogres are basically robust, but… his atmosphere is better than the regular ogre’s.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Tre’ainar… If you knew that, say it sooner…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, does it matter? You said it yourself…… no, the war is over.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Nuu…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Or are you concerned about the war that ended before you were born?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar turns a nasty grin at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar… are you? Do you enjoy throwing back people’s remarks like a boomerang?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, well, who knows?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such situations, he points out what I thought or said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s a pretty good character, the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka, by the way, I… I ran away from home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was pretty forceful, but I said it to Aka in a loud cheerful voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “R-Ran away. What for? Aren’t yer family worried about ya? Why, Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, the gentle Aka is worried about me and asks so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Secret~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, well, people’s past doesn’t matter, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll keep it a secret, so if you don’t want to talk about yourself, you don’t have to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Aka also read my true intentions…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, throwing up a peace sign…… Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, Mr. Aka, the peace sign is strange there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Eh? No? Oh, I’m likin this!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Mr. Aka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Friendly. However, that might be a little out of place. This fellow. Man? Man-ish? Decent demonic man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, yer amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Me? Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why, I… I want ta make friends with people, but I’m scared. Humans find me scary. But, Earth, isn’t scared of me. That’s amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not scared? No, I was scared when we first met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, well, so much happened in a short time, and I was able to have a meal, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I was certainly scared, but now you’re just one of the ogres.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” I-Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Ah! In the end—.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m… the son of a hero? Wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Though I look like this, I’m a disciple of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, by the way, the Great Demon King, the strongest known demon in the history of the world, is right beside me, compared to that… No way?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Earth, amusing! Ya tell such funny jokes! It’s great.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No, i-is that so. Hahaha, it’s the first time I’m saying it too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m still not sure about the line to praise, but it’s fine. I also received it thankfully and laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Well, this is the first time I’ve talked ta a human like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I didn’t think I could talk to Ogre like this either.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So we laughed at each other again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And after a few laughs, Mr. Aka’s expression turned a little serious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. Would ya tell me more about humans?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I wanna make friends with people, but I don’t know how ta make friends.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Coming here, I got asked a little unexpected question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka… do you want to make friends with humans?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I do… one person at a time… making friends… having fun, playing games, having them over for a meal… ah, like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka’s eyes and words were pure, and I knew he meant it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it’s the right moment to ask, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why would Aka want to make friends with humans?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in order to do that, I have to teach him how to make friends first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s not like I mind, and I don’t think it’s a big deal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How to make friends? You don’t have to think that way. Friends are…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How do you make friends?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I tell you, it’s my example.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How did I make friends once…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Earth, I’m a princess. You’re my retainer You belong to me. You’ll always be mine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Princess…… I don’t call her a friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, what about Rebal? Or Fu?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something I noticed, how should I put it…… Well, we were already playing together at the time, whether or not they were real friends, so rather than being a close friend, I’m a childhood friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That reference isn’t helpful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being the case, in addition…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Hey, you’re Earth, right? I’m Glyph! To be acquainted with the son of a hero, the heroes style is my—
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not the same. Not in particular. Well, we’re not friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What else? You know, the other honor student group……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - After the change of seats, I’ll be…… here? Nice to meet you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Ah, Earth!? No, way, I-I’m next to Earth!?? Fu~eeeh, ah ah ah ah, ki~yu!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Gyaah, Coman turned red and passed out!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Oh, Coman, it’s a pity you collapsed. But if you’re against being next to Earth enough to faint, I’ll take your place. yes! It’s my duty as a princess!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s a time they hated just sitting next to me so much that they would faint!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, because of the ‘empty seat substitution’ or something, the princess would raise her hand and sit next to me, and from there she would keep on lecturing me… that girl? So weird. I wonder why water kept falling out of my eyes?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? If I were to classify childhood friends as childhood friends, not as friends, was I friends with them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m…In fact, except for the title ‘The Son of the Hero’……I’m really…No one…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Playing games with humans… ah, Mr. Aka. On the shelf there. Is that a Go Board(Sengo)?」 [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… yeah yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I found a board on the shelf and a stone carved with various marks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is one of the most popular board games no matter how you look at it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is a game to secure your territory while destroying the opponent’s with the stone of the general, the captain, the soldier, and various classes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I play with Sadiz once in a while, and I’m always getting stomped, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, we’ll talk later. Let’s have a game, Aka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “R-Really!? Ya wanna play with me!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Instead, go easy on me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh. Let’s do it now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heheh. Can you play Go, Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know the rules. Honeyborough, a town at the foot of the mountain, is famous for Go, and I wanted ta visit the town someday.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yeah…… eh? Honeyborough Within a few hours, I came pretty far away…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Just in time. There’s a festival at this time of year, and a Go tournament in town.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to shake off a slightly sad experience, I decided to play with Aka to brighten the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh… Go… so nostalgic… fidget, fidget…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems Tre’ainar was itching for something, but I didn’t particularly mind it this time.

 [S1] [Go] is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.
