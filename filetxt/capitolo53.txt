<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I played Go with Aka until quite late. And when I went to bed, before I knew it, it was morning in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the sleep was insufficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, a lot happened yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The battle with Rebal. The falling out with father and the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, meeting Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… like I said, from here go straight and you’ll come across the river. And if you follow the river straight down towards the mountains, you’ll reach the town.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike me, Aka looked extremely drowsy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps it’s the first time he’s played so late at night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sleepy ogre was funny, and I laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, while rubbing his drowsy eyes, he seemed somewhat lonely…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… are you ready ta go?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’m going.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have a specific objective, nor do I have a clear destination in mind yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for the time being, I wanted to leave the ‘Imperial Territory’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although, right on the heels of yesterday, I’m bound to be chased by extra baggage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nonetheless……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Mr. Aka. Is there anything you want from town?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can buy you something before I leave. Mr. Aka really took care of me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t be so carefree forever. I’m so greatly indebted to Mr. Aka it was disappointing that I couldn’t do much to thank him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, seems it’s difficult for Mr. Aka to go to a human town, so I asked if there was something he wanted there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Aka…… why are your eyes moist?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, yer a really nice guy, and I’m so glad we met.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time in my life, I saw ‘tears in the eyes of a real demon’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s no big deal. Anything is fine. Books, furniture, anything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll buy you anything. When I said that, Aka was a little worried…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… cake, I wanna eat that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka, who does not know how to joke, only tells the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So this isn’t a gag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The cake that humans make, I want a taste of it. If I can make it, people may be interested in it. So, try eating it first.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can laugh and cry a little, but don’t show it to your face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Mr. Aka is really pure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow. Well, I’ll go to the town, I’ll make a lot of preparations for a trip, so I’ll buy a cake and stop here again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nodding to my words, Mr. Aka made a peace sign.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, you like that already?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seems it’s just a sign between us, but it’s fine I guess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I smiled and returned the peace sign to Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I forgot something important.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t have a penny in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hunter Registration? Young but an Academy Graduated Warrior?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no… I didn’t graduate yet… I dropped out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you haven’t graduated yet, you’ll be registered as freelancer. If that’s all right, give me your identification.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My, identification…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when I reached the town, I went to a guild that was also a hangout for hunters as well as a bar and the likes. I was penniless but as a hunter I could earn money quickly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you go to a guild that can be called the Employment Security Office in any big town, you’ll have a means to make money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I realized that having not graduated from the Academy yet, I wouldn’t be a regular hunter with national support as an Imperial Warrior, so I could only be the sort of freelance hunter under day to day employment who is entirely self-managed and nothing else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, I thought it would be fine, but I found out that becoming a freelance hunter also required identification, so I was at a loss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, well, can’t we work something out? I don’t care if I wash the dishes or anything else, and if I could introduce something without registering…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s no good. The guild only introduces work to registered hunters, both state warriors and freelance people.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh… seriously…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, so show me your ID.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ran away from home, and I don’t have that now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I did, that information would reach the Imperial City when I was registered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All the same, if someone gets access to ‘Earth Lagann’s’ registration, my whereabouts would be found out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, if I don’t want that, then I can’t even be a hunter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, without requests… not going through the guild, find someone in need, and apply directly…… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Better drop that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the guild reception, someone was calling out from behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, there was a man in his twenties with long black hair tied to the back of his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There are rules for hunters who are said to be synonymous with freedom. People who break the rules…… for example, people who do ‘underworld market’ dealings are despised.” [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was not only one person standing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Don’t do illegal stuff behind the scenes because you’re hard up for money.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shady dealings are no good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Some of them have anti-state employers. You should avoid black market business.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was about ten men, and the atmosphere around them was a little different from a usual person’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, if you’re not going to register, why don’t you move along? We came to find a job.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly the grumbling and fuss being raised behind me made the situation awkward, so I quickly backed down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re a Freelance hunter team. I’m Fuma, the leader. I’d like to see a list of quests being introduced now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, the guild receptionist’s attention also moved from me to the mister who came from behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that it might not be good even if I persisted, so I decided to give up and leave.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s risky… earning money by getting rid of monsters and villains. It feels just like an adventure, but I can’t even do that.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『When setting out on a journey, to not even be able to become hunter, a staple of fundraising… that was unexpected.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「My Identification… sorry.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis troubling. At this rate…… will you even be able to procure books?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After turning away from the guild, I walked down the town’s main street while hanging my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the town at the foot of the mountain, Honeyborough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surrounded by abundant nature, it is like a stopover between the other side of the mountain and the Imperial capital.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result, cultures and people from other countries are intermingled, and although not as huge as the Imperial City, they are full of vigor and prosperity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they don’t seem to know of me yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as Mr. Aka said, they are having a little event all over the town at the moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s the game. In the 136th hand, victory goes to Insei by forfeit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Wooooooooohh!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hundreds of people gathered and many desks and chairs were lined up in a square located in the center of the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There, many children faced each other with serious expressions. They are facing each other in multiple showdowns of Go, the game Aka and I played last night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Hey, child… this is…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, Mr. Aka told us. It’s a Go tournament.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The flag stood in the plaza, and on it was written, ‘15th Sister City Exchange Children’s Go Tournament’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were a lot of children younger than me, who still didn’t seem to be ten years old, but everyone looked serious. And around them, their parents were watching over them with a very excited air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… It was not so before the war, but here Go is thriving.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? Ah, this is a transit point between the Imperial City and other lands, and people from other countries are also coming in. Races and cultures might be different, but I think we got along well through Go, a board game common to humanity.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「And I’ve heard that this town is a sister city of ‘Ounomichi City’ in the ‘Kingdom of Japone’, the country where Go originated, or so I’ve heard.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh… I see… you are familiar with that.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, it’s also a part of the history test… when I was a kid, I met some people from that country who came to a party in the Imperial City.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I’m not that interested in Go itself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never got into it with Sadiz when we played, so I don’t take it so seriously, and I’m not a strong player.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Mr. Aka was too weak, so I managed it yesterday…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar. Do you know Go, too?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By heart, Go is popular even amongst demons.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, is that so?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course. To begin with, Go is a game with a history of more than 1,000 years. It used to be called ‘The Demon King Game’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No way… I mean, if the Demon King plays it, anything will be the Demon King Game.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… No, well… perhaps, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t believe Tre’ainar can play Go. By his speech, might be formidable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s not the point right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s money, money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it stays like this, I can’t afford to go on my trip, let alone a cake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to disappoint Aka, who is looking forward to it, so how to make some money…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『By the way, child. Are you well versed with the Kingdom of Japone?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, all of a sudden… Well, like I said, it was in the history test, so to a certain extent.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Then, are you familiar with the ‘Warriors’ of the Kingdom of Japone?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was thinking about money, Tre’ainar suddenly asked me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Warriors from the Kingdom of Japone? I’m not sure of the intent of the question, but if you ask me if I know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Sure, they’re swordsmen called ‘Samurai’, aren’t they? If the ‘Imperial Knight’ belonged the Empire, the other side would be the ‘Kingdom Samurai’, I know that much.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… then, do you know anything else?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh……? Like the equivalent of the Empire’s hunters… and mages, right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Um. Anything else?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What else?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Other than that? Is there anything else?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something, uh-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, that’s 20 straight wins!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That girl, she’s amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, a loud voice was heard a little away from the plaza.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked back, dozens of men gathered and were surrounding something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I looked into it, I saw a girl sitting across the wall. A man by her side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the desk and the game board were in front of the girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, is there any other challenger? If you can defeat Shinobu Stoke, a 15-year-old from Japone, you’ll win a prize! Now, are there any more challengers?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old man who was by the girl’s side was shouting so loudly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the girl in question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Straight long black hair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She has a fairly well-formed face, but is as expressionless as a doll.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seems to be the same age as me, fifteen years old, but dressed in a very unusual outfit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She wears a black-clad, light-skinned outfit, her left leg exposed with a cut-off skirt, and socks that extend above her knees. It seems to put emphasis on easy ‘movement’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the skin, it’s white! not a healthy shade, she’s as white as snow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her chest is pretty big, too. At the same age as me? Well, is the princess a little bigger?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… or rather, the cut skirt! Down there, I think it’ll be exposed if you’re careless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Kouga. That’s enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, though her face remained expressionless, the woman, with an air of contemplation, called away the older man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” I’ve grasped the level of Go in the empire. We’ve killed time and earned money, but the pathos won’t surge.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ojou…” [2] [S2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather, I, you know, have big breasts, right? Maybe because my outfits are getting more provocative but I can’t stand feeling nauseous and tired from their nasty gaze. Now, let’s join Onii-san. I wish my brother would find a quest that would shine away his boring days.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if they are looking down on the flocks of men, or the empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, her boobs are not particularly up there… when next to a huge pair, like the princess’s… not to mention if you compare it to Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it’s certainly a little irritating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no one among those gathered took up the gentleman’s challenge, seems that woman is very strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh… perhaps you should go for the prize…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eye of the Great Demon King by my side glowed suspiciously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The word used here, 闇営業, has multiple iterations. Wasn’t sure which to use, so I used them all…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] The Japone seems to be a stand in for Japanese. So I decided to keep the titles and honorifics whenever they talk. Let me know if it’s bothersome.
</div>
