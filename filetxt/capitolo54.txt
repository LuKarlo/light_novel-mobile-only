<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A bored woman looking down on the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s none of my business, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Accept that little girl’s challenge.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… huh?? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Would the prize not be convenient?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to leave, but Tre’ainar’s suggestion surprised me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Whoa, come on, what are you talking about? No matter what prize they are declaring, she’s a national level talent, isn’t she? I’m not that good at it, no way I’ll win.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how strong she is, but if you’re betting on 20 consecutive wins or a prize, you know she’s a pretty big shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me to beat such an opponent……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The child need only engage as I instruct.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Huh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, it is I who shall play.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That proposal left me frozen with my mouth open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What are you saying, Tre’ainar? Oh, you’re…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis no issue. After all, tis but a small girl. She is no opponent to me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No, no, no… But…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought that Tre’ainar would step up himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s his state of mind?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Were it simply to earn meager funds, I would not intervene as tis the child’s trial… but, the circumstances are special this time. For the time being, I wish to reward the ogre for saving the child as the Great Demon King… if tis to buy a cake and other articles, then I shall assist you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is not for me, but for Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a way, Tre’ainar, who was once the King of the all Demons, is trying to reward a demon that lives in the present…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Also… much funds would be required if you are to purchase books. Everything you bought was abandoned at your home, was it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ……that’s the real purpose, isn’t it? But, well…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Seriously! Still, you have a point… it sounds interesting.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, doesn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the only one who can see him. I’m the only one who can talk to him. I’m the only one here who knows of the existence of The Great Demon King Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in this way, Tre’ainar is trying to show his presence through me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I remembered the mischief of the days of my childhood and was somewhat excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll play you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””” Eh!!!???”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I raised my hand to the woman and the old man as they were about to leave the stand due to lack of challengers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, oh, this is a manly challenger! Are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! You’ll give me a prize if I win?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course I will. If you win, it’s 100,000 Tsuvlad!” [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “100,000…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If we win, 100,000 Tsuvlad… given my penniless state, I shouldn’t see it as passable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s less than my one-month allowance, but…what? Hey, Tre’ainar. Why are you reading my mind and looking like, “Wow” there?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, brother, you’re brave.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good luck, man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, spectators gathered around and cheered me on as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Laughing bitterly at such voices, I sat face-to-face across the woman,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you about my age?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m 15”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes. Citizen of the Empire?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I grew up in Imperial City.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really … of the Imperial City ……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sitting still in front of me, the woman looks me over again with great interest and laughs a little… No, why do I get the feeling she’s laughing up her nose at me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nyaya…… I’ll show you something in your eyes! ……Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, wait a minute, if you intend to challenge ojou, pay 10,000 Tsuvlad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!? Errr!? You’re taking money!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, they’re going to bet money on it, so it’s only natural that a challenger’s fee will be taken here as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t have 10,000 now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind, Kouga. I can beat a boy of my age, so I’ll provide that much service.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… no, if ojou says so…… but are you sure? If you lose, won’t ojou’s pocket money be gone?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu… you’re worried about me. Thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, what’s ‘Fu’. There’s no way we’re going to lose. That’s how it looks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, the first move is yours. Come on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m grateful to you for the service, but I’m so irritated that I’m not sure what to do, Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmph… good! Now then…… Upper right corner, stars.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Tre’ainar’s first move was unleashed through me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu immediately strikes the second move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Komoku (3-4 point) 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Go. The game of conquering territory on the board.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A game in which you destroy your opponent’s defense with your own pieces and expand your territory, preventing and intercepting enemies that attack at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… the campaign is a little dated.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu muttered with a slightly thoughtful expression as we talked to each other about a few moves in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My tactics are from fifteen years ago. I suppose this girl is saying ‘dated’ in that sense.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? Is that right?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar seems to have understood the true meaning of Shinobu’s muttering. But isn’t that bad?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s ability is unknown, but his knowledge of Go stopped as of 15 years ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like civilization, the tactics of Go will change in 15 year.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Advance the first formation forward.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was then…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After they had played each other by about a dozen hands, Shinobu opened her eyes and stopped her hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… uh. This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And not only stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She leaned forward, looking at the entire board as if she were taking it all in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? Why? In this early stage?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fufufu… you want to beat the units that have advanced, but to do so, you will have to break the defensive formation that you are trying to complete in a few more moves. Furthermore, if you send troops to destroy that unit, the troops themselves will become obstacles, and subsequent proper attack formations will not be possible.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? No, why? How can you say that with only a few hands? No, but is it true?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her eyes were wide open.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tch……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I wonder. In this situation, I shall play the same move. Your formations have more or less been broken, if you hit the troops now, whatever future move you play, it seems that you can be read perfectly.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu finally made her next move with a click of her tongue, Trainer nodded with a slightly gentle face, saying ‘right’ as if he were teaching her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Keima (Knight)』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sort of… this is the first time I’ve seen Tre’ainar watching over me… What? I wonder what…It’s like a momentary…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child… do not play so casually.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Go requires deep thought and the ability to read ahead. It improves your concentration, thinking, analytical and anticipatory skills. As it were, I read the opponent’s best moves and guided them as I wished… tis always useful in combat.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『While playing, think about my intentions as well. From now on, we shall play together… this will train your concentration, reading and thinking skills, so I will play you a lot from now on.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. This is also a way for Tre’ainar to train me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you want to train my pre-reading? Well, I’ll do it, and if Tre’ainar says so, will I remember it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I’m a disciple. Me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Shinobu spoke out again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, it’s a pretty surprised voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh … u … “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu has a cold, sharp expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, the crowd suddenly began to buzz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, the upper right position of the young lady has completely collapsed!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, this brother, who is he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That really strong girl is overwhelmed, isn’t she?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And looking at this board, even I could understand the state of the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, Tre’ainar. Is this woman strong?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, she is impressive. She has a well-balanced, steady play style. At this young age, she is quite formidable.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「That much?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. If you replace the perspective to an actual warrior… Imperial Knight…… then she has the power of the advanced warrior class.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Seriously!?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar who crushes the attacks of such a woman, and annihilates them…… if I were to play you, wouldn’t I give up right away?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey!? Oh, come on, it can’t be!? The young lady’s field, as she tried to solidify her defense…… he cut it in two!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Usually, a game of Go is often played for tens of minutes, or hours if you’re not proficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, just a few minutes, dozens of hands…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… guh… I… I lost…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And without making her next move, the woman in front of me…… Shinobu surrendered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was over in just a blink of an eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T-Thank you very much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And… you’re too strong… Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, a development such as “Defeated the opponent nobody could beat because they were too strong” is the one so good it would end in cheers.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, including the gathered crowd, everyone was still.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Ojou lost… That’s stupid… As for Go, ojou who was hailed as Japone’s godchild…… What…… what was this man …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old man beside Shinobu called Kouga is also stunned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is, due to the extent of such an overwhelming victory they are totally at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, Tre’ainar… even if a little, couldn’t you have held back?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hah~… Well…… I could afford to stay my hand a tad, but it has been so long time since last I played the game and she was a formidable opponent, I have gained much experience.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar… that self-satisfied face is too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if I wasn’t Go, I would have been mercilessly killed if we sparred.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about this woman’s feelings now……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y… You…… Who the hell are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By any chance…you’re a Shinken-shi(Earnest Master), right?” [2] [S2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinkenshi? What is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For the time being… as promised, I’ll pay you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu immediately raises her face. Staring straight at me with her dignified eyes, she took out her wallet from her pocket and slammed it on the desk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, aaah… yes. Well, that’s it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, money is money. Let’s get out of here and buy a cake without making a fuss or getting entangled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, how long have you been playing Go for?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With everything that happened, surely Shinobu will have a lot of questions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I’m half joking, but kind of really in the mood for mischief…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From Legend”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………eh………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Answering so, and I try to reach for the money on the desk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “One more time… with me……let’s play(yes)… Can you give me that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden, Shinobu grabbed my wrist and held it tight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A loss is a loss. But I’m sorry for underestimating you, I made a mistake in handing you the first move.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that, no, I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, even without it, I know you are far stronger than me. But I want to fight with all my might and see the difference between you and I.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like she saw through my intention to quickly leave before getting dragged into something bothersome. To make sure I wouldn’t escape, with her blank expression, she tightly grasped me so hard it was painful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In my hometown, I’ve never lost to anyone my age. Go, grades, beauty. Look, I have big breasts, you know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is… is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Without exception, until now that is… I took the boys of Imperial City too lightly. But, passionate pathos is surging.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sorry. It was not me of the same age that played you, but a Demon King who lived for thousands of years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I’m sure you’ve got a big chest, but the princess is still bigger…that doesn’t matter…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, but I have a lot of plans…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You live in the Imperial City, then we’re going to the Imperial City next, so how about that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?! Oh, no… oh, I have some business to do, not in the Imperial City, but the place to go next…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, it is. Where are you staying? Then, let’s play it in your room.” [3] [S3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh, no, what? What’s with, this woman, her face is expressionless yet I feel such staggering pressure, or rather, I mean, it’s scary!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is this momentum like ‘do not escape’?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please, ojou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can you not be silent, Kouga?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I let this once-in-a-lifetime encounter end my heart would feel much disgrace.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Shinobu rejects old man Kouga’s voice as he tried to intervene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good, this woman… she might be a bad type to get involved with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, but, ojou… it’s about time you met with ‘leader’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, can you tell Anii-san that I’ll go later?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no, you were strictly told to be punctual! Even if you don’t have a quest today, you’re sure to perform a formation review exercise.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~~~Oh, I know already.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, it looks like you’ve changed your mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good —
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you. I have to go now… Where can I find you tonight?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, it’s no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…I’ll stay at the inn on that Street tonight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, it seems. Then you don’t have to put on airs. Isn’t it a reward for you? With me, such a beauty and big brea―”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―slip, thud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And something fell to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like a slime… What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… it got smaller.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Shinobu’s chest, which should have been there, was gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment everyone noticed it, Shinobu quickly picked up what had fallen to the ground and hid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t it possible to misunderstand? This ‘Sobra’ was only fitted with emphasis on the inner element, I was expecting that there might be a lot of trouble during the journey, in order to play the opponent’s attack, I decided comprehensively that a bra made of this slime, commonly known as Sobra was very suitable for the defense, so I thought to make my chest bigger, I don’t care about them being small, in the first place, my age is still in a growth period, so they will grow bigger in the future―”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, for some reason, me and all the gallery folks were sorry for Shinobu, and old man Kouga sadly put his hand on her shoulder,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ojou… true…… there is still a future…” [4] [S4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” ~~~, anyway, promised me tonight? I’ve already remembered you. I’m locked on. Okay!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu and the old man, whose expressionless faces turned red for the first time, left the place with a trot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「She was a strange woman…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tonight. Well, I care not if you intend to play… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「No way. I don’t want to get involved. Quickly, just leave this town.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said it unintentionally, but I didn’t want to get involved with her anymore. I decided to buy a cake quickly, so I went to the cake shop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unfortunately, I’ll have a very early reunion with Shinobu, who I was hoping to not get involved with anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was not on the board, but a reunion on the battlefield.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, I was wondering if the readers of this novel are of the same age group…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] I’m guessing ツブラだ refers to their currency. Phonetically it goes, Tsuburada, but I went with Tsuvlad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] The word here, 真剣師, refers to those who play board games for stakes (big money). Usually used for Shogi players but can also apply for Go, Chess and Yu-gi-oh!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] PHRASING!! This can so be taken the wrong way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Yes, there is… (︶︹︺)
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
