 Cake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, there are too many types.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bite size. Chocolate —fruit-ones, in the hall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Which one is better …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t hear of Aka’s taste.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a while, I stared in front of the sweet cakes lined up in the cake shop in the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar. Do you know what ogre’s prefer?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I am not privy to that much. However, if it is a cake, the standard might be strawberry shortcake. But he also said he wanted to make it himself. Then, I would not want to dismiss pound cakes and cupcakes, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t really know about the types of cake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz made everything I ate while saying ‘So Good, So Good’, but the types…… I don’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar. You’re…… no way, sweets, cooking… you’re familiar with food.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, even if you don’t use ‘no way’, if you’re a trainer……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I may look like this, but in the past… I managed the Demon Kingdom’s Gourmet Sorority and pursued the ultimate cuisine. Tis said to be the authority of the gastronomic world, especially the tongue of demons ……Devilitan—』 [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it was something like that. Really, this guy has everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s not the Great Demon King. He’s a Superhuman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We have 100,000, so it should buy a lot in the Imperial City. In the first place, Mr. Aka is so big that he’ll eat a lot.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, tis so. And why not go to a bookstore and buy a book on how to make cakes?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. All right, excuse me! The line-up on this shelf, give me all of it please!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Oi, I thought about it when it came to the books, but I think you should also learn a little about the financial sense, right? Well, this time tis fine as you are using it for other, but…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Financial sense? That’s rude. I’ve got that kind of thing, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, all that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-That’s right. I have the money.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that so? All right, I’ll pack it up and prepare it, so wait a minute.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, then, can I get you a small cake and some milk while I’m waiting?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, of course. There’s a chair and a table outside, so please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The money I spent this time is for Mr. Aka’s sake, and I’m not going to use it all at once and go bankrupt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I made the cake I eat reasonable in quantity and price.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, this fund of 100,000 is still my entire asset, and if I use it as I want, it will be gone in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really, I’m not aiming to live in luxury, but… from now on, I’ll have to think about money a lot. I never thought I’d be unable to even work as a hunter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Certainly. Well, in a bigger city, or if you go to another country, there are plenty of other work, playing games for stakes, gambling, fistfights, bodyguard, nightlife and so on that you can do without the need for such identification.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Underworld occupations… I feel like I’m getting more and more tainted.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless, life from now on…… if I can’t go back to the old days anymore, you have to think about things to live and to eat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It might be necessary to do some unscrupulous work that doesn’t matter what you are.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made me feel a little bit more sensitive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, if you do not like anything other than a privileged environment, tis much better to seek a compromise with your parents and the world from the beginning, apologize, and return to the Empire.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said that to take advantage of my depression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believe this is a good experience. Those who see only the world’s surface and the beautiful things are, after all, thin existences of peace. The front and the back. By knowing the dirt of the world and people and growing on it, the answers you give one day will also weigh on you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, he’s saying that this situation now is another way to raise yourself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You once said. ‘I want to be a man who can go anywhere’. Then you should go. And now is the time to learn of what you cannot see and cannot experience just by living normally. Even if the world is generally a corrupt world… a man of strength can shine in such a world.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Know both front and back. That’s what it means to cross the world. To know the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I… somehow… I feel like I understand. At least, if I were the way I used to be, someone like Mr. Aka… if we hadn’t talked, I would have known that there was a guy like him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh… that is so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think that falling into this situation is an opportunity to experience various things.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just positive thinking, it’s all about a brighter future.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s words convinced me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shortcake and milk. Here you are.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, thanks”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While we were talking, a cake shop attendant brought me cake and milk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’ll take some sugar and clear my head for the time being.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm, sugar is best for a tired body.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m a little hungry, and I pick up a fork and try to poke the cake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was worried about something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar… Well, you know…I’ve never cared…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re dead, but… are you feeling hungry, thirsty, or want to eat something?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You’re already dead, so you won’t starve to death.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if you can read a book or feel bored, I felt a simple question about such hunger so I asked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the trainer gave it a little thought, but immediately shook his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… certainly there is no such desire. For instance, if there is an unknown food, I may desire to know the taste later…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. So do not worry about such trifles.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t worry, Tre’ainar says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, when I was eating a meal in the mansion, I was with Sadiz, and I was so obsessed with training that I wasn’t worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now I’m out in the outside world, and I’m already with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, even if last night was an exception, I’m the only one who ate a dish outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something is a little lonely, too……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……excuse me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, sir.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once I realized, I called the clerk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cake and milk… can you bring me one more?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… Refill…… is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, well, like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was asking for another set of cake and milk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than a refill, it’s more like for ‘one more person’…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No…… I know you can’t eat it, I know there’s not much meaning, and it’s a waste of money, but… I’ll eat it later …I feel like it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s an offering. but … well … let’s enjoy just the mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little weird, but I also ordered ‘Tre’ainar’s Portion’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar laughed with his nose…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Even if you don’t do that… in the dream world of 【Vier】, if I restore my senses and embody what you have eaten in the image, I could eat it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is that right!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That it is. If I encountered an ingredient I was interested in, I was thinking of having it done.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well then…… this is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Simply a waste of money. I care not for the cake you eat, nor is the milk tantalizing, rather, coffee is the better option. If you intend to spend that much money, buy a book.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, uh, that’s right, I’m sorry! Geez, I wasted money …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had no significance. Tre’ainar laughed at meddling, making me turn away with embarrassment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to me, Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well…it may not mean much, but… the ambiance… if only your feelings, I appreciate and gratefully accept it …』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Taking me into consideration, for a moment I felt really embarrassed, and I tried to gloss over it by shoving the cake in my mouth in one bite.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hnn?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then suddenly there was something in our view on the terrace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Smoke rose from the mountainside outside the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? …… a fire?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No… That… a beacon?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know what the smoke really is. But in any case, I had a bad feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because in that direction …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s that smoke. Do you know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe they’re the ones? You know, from Japone, who came to this city yesterday…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! No, I was in the guild this morning!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, people who seemed to be residents of the town who passed by us on the terrace of the shop chatted with each other …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So I heard a little bit about it, that’s a good quest, so to temper their team coordination, they went to train in those mountains.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, are those guys doing that? Surely it’s the hunter team from Japone… ‘The Elusive Ninjas’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard the story, me and Trainer looked at each other and there was a terrible foreboding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] [Shoukugeki ] no Tre’ainar anyone?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
