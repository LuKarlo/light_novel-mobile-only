 I have a bad feeling about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ran for the smoke I saw from the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a bag containing a bunch of boxes of cakes being carried in my hands, and I ran through the mountains.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might run a little roughly and the cake might lose its shape, but let’s have Aka put up with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, what do you think, Tre’ainar? The story just before…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A team of hunters from Japone… what about it?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That woman… do you think she has anything to do with the Hunter team?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well… the possibility is high.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If she was a hunter, too… what happens if Mr. Aka is found?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Who could say… well. Even after the war, I know not what the reaction will be… for certain. As for how they may react… undoubtedly, not much has changed from before and now.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The first thing that came to me when I heard ‘Japone’ was that woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the old man called Kouga who was by her side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the way we talked, they seemed to be with some others, but they were from Japone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that woman of the same age as me a hunter? She said something about her brother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That Aka, the ogre… he was kind to you, but if you fight, your power will probably… I do not think you should worry.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I don’t know. But, well, I have a bad feeling… if Mr. Aka is safe, that’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surely, it’s also difficult to move quickly while carrying delicate cargo in both hands that can’t be handled roughly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Read the obstacles one step ahead and proceed with the shortest, safest course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Last night, Tre’ainar taught me Magical Parkour, but I can’t take advantage of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, even in a rush, be more aware of the peripheral vision for Magical Parkour, and read further ahead as you would in a game of Go.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry. But…… groan, hit the head!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not let your mind wonder by simply reading two or three obstacles and avoiding them. If you avoid one, you will always need to read it until the next one, else you will crash into other obstacles such as trees!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s why I can’t do it very well because I’m holding cake!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not dynamically push forward with reckless abandon. Especially as you take the trouble to carry something delicate while moving, handle with both grace and prudence.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s pretty difficult!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you hurry too fast, you’ll run into a tree. If you are too conscious of trees, you will be late. If you are considerate of the cake, you’ll be halfway there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t use my body well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe, if confirming Mr. Aka’s safety comes first, should I throw away the cake? I can always buy it again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I thought so last night, you can only use your body and fight on level grounds and arenas after all. The basics of ‘landing’ and ‘rolling’ necessary for parkour have not been established in the first place. Tis why even rabbits could not be caught.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And you’re bringing up new terms… what is that? Tell me while I run!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, as I was not in a position to sit down and listen to the usual polite explanation, I asked him to be urgent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well… the landing is called a four-point landing. Simply put, by landing with both hands and feet, tis the basic technique to disperse the impact of falling into four. Then, rolling is a technique in which impact is dispersed by rolling forward when landing. Tis known that safe landing is more essential than the way you run before learning parkour.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s what I did!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believed this was something that would naturally be learned while playing outside and running around in the mountains as a child… then again, you are a city life twit…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, you said twit again!? Fine, I care about it! Roughly, if you have cake, you can’t do the four-point thing that way! So I’ll throw it away, this cake!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, I don’t have the basics or the essentials necessary for learning parkour.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So what do I do now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I have to remember this with my body……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…? Eh!!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, you’re quite loud… young one. In the depths of the mountains like this, what’s with the luggage you’re holding?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden, I heard a very calm, nonchalant voice in my ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I involuntarily stop and turn my body toward the voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… where?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was someone sitting cross-legged on the branch of the next tree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whole body is wrapped in black clothing, and the head is covered with a black hood and the mouth is covered with a black mask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And on his back, he carries what appears to be a small, short sword.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how you look at it, they’re suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, who are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… I’m a hunter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The tone is calm, with no feeling of hostility.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I don’t know how they look because the face is hidden.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. Well, I’m sorry, but I’m in a bit of a hurry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, can’t you wait a minute? No, I’m really sorry if you’re in a hurry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to get a little response, and the moment I said that, as expected, he stopped me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Presently, me and my comrades are soon to participate in some stern special training just beyond this point. I’m sorry to bother you, but can you take a detour? If you’re in such a hurry, I could guide you right away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying it politely, but in short, it seems that you want for me not to interfere because you’re in a special training session.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s all right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If it is just ‘Special training’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You? Are you a hunter from Japone?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Have you heard of it in town? Indeed, my people are from Japone, and I’m a freelance hunter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as I thought. And at the same time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… Be careful…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This one… talking about freelance hunters and such… is that not too generous?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems Tre’ainar felt something in the hunter in front of him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, however you look at it, it doesn’t look normal, and it’s suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I don’t care which hunter you are, but I’d like to get this cake to my friend soon. I’ll be going ahead.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t want to bother you, but… supposing we’re in the territory of the Empire, to be ordered by a group from other countries, let alone free hunters, I’m not likely to comply, am I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… if you say it like that, ungh, sounds like you’re not…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If they’re just suspicious, that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re training normally, that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there are things that I am concerned about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is not to worry about anything if these guys are not related to Mr. Aka at all, and it is only training in the place where Mr. Aka happens, and it is not noticed the presence of Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s because they’re just training where Aka is. No matter what they’re doing, if they’re unaware of Aka’s existence, then I wouldn’t care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, ‘Do you know that an ogre is up ahead?’, I can’t say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it’s a bit of a roundabout inquiry, but how does he react…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… get your wits up and be wary… pay attention without showing it on your face. Right now…… are you not surrounded?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “………………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『One person diagonally left to the rear… one to the right from behind…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, I didn’t notice. You’re pretty good at hide and seek.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, there are three of them, including the one before us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if there’s nothing wrong with that, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~ … I wanted to be careful, but…… okay, I have to be honest with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the man in front of me raised his hands to show that there was no hostility, as he thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In fact, a dangerous existence happened to be found by my poor people during special training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dangerous existence?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An atrocious monster… Ogre”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh…why do I have a bad feeling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A dangerous species that brought death and tragedy to tens of thousands of human beings in the great war of the past… before leaving it to harm the people of the world, my leader and colleagues are now trying to subdue it with all their might. Therefore, this mountain and the forest are very dangerous now. And so, I have to keep an eye out for my people so that no one approaches. Please, can’t you listen to us here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it is unavoidable then. I nodded, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. There’s an atrocious monster, no… I didn’t know that. Well, it really~ should be subdued.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, I’m sorry you’re in a hurry, but thank you for your understanding.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got it. It has to be subdued. If it’s an atrocious monster… well?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Actually, apart from the one you’re talking about, there’s a kind-hearted ogre living there. Do you know that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s my friend… well, I mean… you’re not misunderstanding and attacking my friend, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, Aka is different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s kinder than anyone else, and he’s so fragile. He’s not someone to be called cruel and outrageous…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… you’re involved with that red ogre? Kind-hearted? What do you mean? You’re not planning anything with that red ogre, are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh…… I wonder why this is happening.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I use the technique of the Great Demon King, it’s shameless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I make friends with an ogre, I’m no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the people of the Imperial City, but also those of other countries … Ah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’ll explain the situation quickly and we’ll talk about it somehow… discussion…… let’s talk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no, that’s not true. Sure, an ogre is an ogre! But he helped me when I was in trouble!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… help…… no way, to get information on humans?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just good intentions! You can tell if you talked to Mr. Aka! He’s kind, clumsy, and really wants to make friends with people!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean… I never, to be won over by an ogre…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Discussion…… Talk……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true. Stop your people right now! I’ll tell you a little bit. There are few good people in the world as decent as Mr. Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Showing such negligence, it was keeping its head down for an opportunity and didn’t want to be discovered. The other party is an ogre. You must know nothing about ogres!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Talk…… ah… just…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My people have experienced the war before and know all about the demons and the ogre race. They’re all the species that have to be driven out! That’s why young people these days…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, no. ‘young people these days’, when it came out, it was all over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey…… asshole, that’s enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For some reason you olden days people, who stopped thinking for yourselves, have the nerve… every last one of them … in any country!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put the cake I had on the tree, and I roared at it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You. What do you bastards intend for Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jump in and one shot!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fast!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uraaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I drove my right straight into his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man took my fist and fell to the ground…?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-What? L-Log!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hit a man in the face without a doubt now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, man’s appearance became a log at that moment. No, did they change?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a Transformation art. Child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Transformation?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Behind you. Here they come!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right after I reacted to Tre’ainar’s words, I heard a familiar voice from behind me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was surprised that you showed up, but… I’ll give an explanation afterwards.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now, good night.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A blow with a sword handle to the head. The vibration causes paralysis all over my body, and my body falls to the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is used to stun people…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was totally surprised… eh? Iga, wasn’t it a bit dangerous?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hum. One step slower and I would have been beaten. He is no mere man… is he ojou’s acquaintance?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That young man was in town a little while ago… he was playing Go with ojou… what happened…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah…… it was really dangerous. At Tre’ainar’s warning, I would have lost consciousness if I hadn’t responded and displaced the area where I was hit a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good grief… wasn’t expecting you… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Three of them looked surprised at me when I got up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of them was called ‘Iga’, the masked man I was talking about a while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other is an old man I met in the city called ‘Kouga’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was a little surprised… what are you doing? Shinobu… was it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… how can you get up now? What the hell are you…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, is this woman, Shinobu, also involved?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you’re going to get in the way, there’s only one hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I take a quick step to take the ‘Great Demon Flicker’.
