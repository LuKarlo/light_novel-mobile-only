 “The young man talks about friendship with an Ogre… whether he’s being deceived or brainwashed, I haven’t the slightest interest.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He is good enough to win a game of Go against Ojou… no mere brat, that’s for certain.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a sort of bare-handed style… a type I’ve never seen before, however…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They seemed to be wary of me when I rose up and set up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But they don’t want to believe me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “However, based on the circumstances we should avoid excessive violence if possible. I will hold him down here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me poised in the flicker stance, the masked man named Iga stepped forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such bloodlust, also that weird transformation technique he used to dodge my attack, but it won’t work this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, these ones may be free hunter, but the reality is different… do not let your guard down.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Tre’ainar?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He is from Japone… furthermore, the transformation art he just utilized…… these are—』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What Tre’ainar felt from these guys as they were saying something earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understood that they’re not mere warriors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be that negligent, I still have too much confidence in myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I have no grudges, but young man… if you don’t retreat, I will entertain you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s right. Or, you guys say you’re hunters, but who are you, really? You’re a war veteran.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That I can’t say so easily.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Iga puts his center of gravity slightly lower.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My senses tell me he gathered enough force in order to nimbly jump out at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is, nothing like this has occurred in the academy mock battle I’ve had so far, it’s the first time I’ve ever seen this posture.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And although he seems calm, he is also exuding killing intent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll say it once more…will you retire…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re not going to listen to me, only to words convenient for you, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It appears so. In that case, then … sorry!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I refused to answer his final warning, Iga moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Japone Running Art - “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Straight towards me…… Fast……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not. The speed itself is probably not that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s just ‘looks fast’ due to the sharpness of the run, the pace and the steps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As he runs, he steps forward by raising the heel without bending the knees in the middle, and accelerates suddenly as you think he slowed down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One of the steps I was doing on the ladder training. ‘The Great Demon Goose Step’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a feint.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I can understand the theory, don’t panic and calm down……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s slower compared to Rebal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Goose pran — Ah …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see, go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anticipate the opponent’s movements and counter with a left jab to the jaw the moment he jumps in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Iga!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time it’s not a transformation. Iga himself eats a pinpoint blow to the jaw and collapses like a puppet with a broken string.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, hey, hey, why!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh …? Eh? Iga …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instant defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the blow is obviously a shock to Kouga and Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now is the time!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Goose Step】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can do it, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Run towards Kouga and cut the steps just before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kouga, who is still shaken, is further delayed by my feint.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I jump into Kouga’s chest and clench my left fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fast, then, from below, or, defend!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kouga, get back!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was in a panic, Kouga managed to move his body and raise his fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s too late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While rushing in at the step, hit straight out from the position between the hook and upper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t particularly reveal it in the match with Rebal, but it’s a punch different from straight, hook, upper and body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its name is ‘Great Demon Smash’. If it hits…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fly to the end! 【Heavenly Comet • Supreme Annihilation Fist 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Why would you name a smash launched from below a comet? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The words of Tre’ainar, who has no sense of naming, don’t bother me, and the strikes land on the opponent’s arm as he tried to defend his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a response!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, tch, goho…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kouga”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-I’m alright, O-Ojou, step back! This one is…… not normal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was not enough to knock him out because he guarded to some extent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Time to get serious! It’s rough, but with my art, I’ll have you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, his nose was crushed and blood flowing out, but Koga gazes at me with sharp eyes as if he is resolved rather than dismayed, and begins a strange hand movement at high speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That, like a mage’s chant… tis a ‘Seal’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seal?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, that is the warrior from the Kingdom of Japone, who once supported humankind from the shadows in the great war… the Ninja Warrior’s Ninjutsu!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, that… it was among yesterday’s topics…… ah, that’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wind Art Jutsu, 【Spiral Maelstrom!! 】” [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, these guys were the ninja warriors that I admired when I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to be honest, I was still cool and calm without letting my eyes shine with longing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems to be a different type of attack than our magic, but in the end it’s a wind attribute attack, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whirlwind turns into sharp blades, blows all around and attacks me …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Terra Spell, 【Kilo Mud Wall!! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, magic!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aaand…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wall made from soil appears from the ground and blocks it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I slam my fists against the clay wall, destroy it, and launch the fragments at Kouga.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Stars Crust, um … ehhhhh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ts, ou, ooooooh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To forget the name of your own special attack. Tis why I said you should employ the skill name that I put forth…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel a little embarrassed by Tre’ainar’s quip, but the power is still the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kouga took the mud wall fragments head on and suffered damage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, c-curses… cane…… boy…… you, who are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kouga is shaken with a wounded knee.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ninja Warrior…… what a letdown!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I would impress on you to not get carried away, but… well, far from it. At first, I wondered how you would fare, but these ones are at intermediate level. Originally, tis the height of folly for warriors who specialized in stealth and assassination to engage in battle head on. Unless you are at the mercy of an unknown technique, they are no match for the child whose power already surpasses a senior warrior…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at Tre’ainar’s words, my dominance turns into conviction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Should be fine. If this is the case, I’ll be at Aka’s place soon…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Amazing… surprise peach on a Sichuan shrub tree…… that’s how much.” [2] [S2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To defeat Iga with a single blow and overwhelm Kouga. Not only Go, but also unexpectedly strong … aren’t you my ideal type?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Shinobu who had fallen back a little from our attack and defense, came out with a smile that I couldn’t imagine from her expressionless face when we first met.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yes, that’s right. Not in this situation… and if my chest was bigger to start with, I was so excited that it was finally time to be popular.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? …… u-umm, really, what a shame. But if you bet on the possibilities of the future, you can do your best, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine. Even if I desperately give it my all from now, I can’t reach my ideal bust size.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two of her companions were down, so I thought she would be more distressed, but Shinobu, to my surprise, came forth with some joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, but now I’m a man who prioritizes friendship over women… Don’t interfere!” [3] [S3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, this girl, to tell a joke in this kind of situation, it is very different from the bored doll appearance she had in town…… uh huh? Lady, you’re joking, aren’t you? Eh? Who’s your type? Me? Oh, it’s okay, isn’t it? That was like an empty compliment, wasn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, Sadiz and the Princess would tell me, ‘Be careful of the woman who seduces you as the son of the hero in her aim for money and status’, ‘The Honey Trap’, and such. I’ve been told not to be deceived by the words of such women, and that I have a soft spot for girls with such allure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, eh? She doesn’t know that I’m the son of a hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me? This girl, might be flat as a board, but she has a pretty face, and if she’s really interested in me… eh? What should I do…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, why the agitation. Never mind that…… you best believe the crucial moment comes after this.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I thought by some chance my time really came, but I got Tre’ainar’s advice in a slightly serious tone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crucial moment?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ach, O-Ojou…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Back away with Iga, Kouga. I’ll handle this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? She wants to go one-on-one with me, even though the two old men are done? A girl the same age as me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, well, even though she is a woman, if her power is the same class as the princess, this confidence is also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re proud of your ability to defeat two of the Chunin… Then, next…Why don’t you feel the power of Jounin?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Joe nin?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I may have been overwhelmed on the board, but it will not be that easy with combat, will it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Shinobu takes out a small sword and sets it up at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I again get ready with the Great Demon Flicker as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now then, let’s communicate through bout, instead of on the board. But, it’ll be accompanied more or less with pain, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, scary. Would the pain of your first time hurt more, I wonder. Would you like to receive lessons in both, I wonder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? Wh-Who knows… I-I am undyed by such matters…… mo-more important is…… Friendship. Hand-holding…… Exchange diaries and such…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……… You…… are still budding.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The real player of the previous game was Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, this is the first real showdown between me and Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But first, I have to try to disrupt her pace… then, knock her down fast, end it quick and off to Mr. Aka’s place!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The move name, 鳴門渦巻, is literally [Naruto Uzumaki! BELIEVE IT!!!]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] ………WHAT????
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
