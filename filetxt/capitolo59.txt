<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sincerely respected and admired the ninja who fought to protect the country, the world, and humanity from the shadow without revealing themselves to the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Born into a lineage of prestigious ninjas, I chose this path of my own volition, not just as a fate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To leave nothing of your name to the world as a result. I felt that the spirit of humility was not to seek fame or honor, but a manifestation of a pure desire to ‘protect something’ more than anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, above all, I thought that it was very cool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be a ninja is to have a variety of extensive disciplines. Ninjutsu. Weaponry. Taijutsu. Strategy. Covert art. Assassination. In addition, the general knowledge necessary for infiltration, and specialized fields unique to ‘female ninja’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I understood from an early age that ‘Ninja excel at everything’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, it was my path to become ‘an existence capable of anything’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I invested myself in the training from an early age to go all the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also skipped a grade to graduate from the Ninja Academy, and became the youngest ninja warrior in history, then to Genin, Chunin, and finally the youngest Jounin. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the shinobi path that I arrived at was far from what I had idealized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, the next mission is to escort Viscount Ouge Letz, who is on the way to the red light district incognito. Once that is done, Yatou, the anti-government sympathizer, falls. Achieve the task in the midst of their demonstration.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, the prince said, ‘I want to make a pilgrimage to the sacred site that became the stage of a book that I love’. In addition to serving as bodyguards, Jounin will also entertain people by wearing costumes and disguising themselves as characters.“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want you to lend me a few free genin. I’d like to ask them to dig potatoes in the field.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The world is at peace. That’s wonderful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ironically, however, the duty assigned to us Shinobi by those with influence was not so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although I was born after the war and had not experienced war, I was able to accept it as ‘this is the reality’, but dear elder brothers, who knew the war and the ninja’s secret epic, felt unsatisfied with the present situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t screw around. Damn, this treatment of shinobi! A common general store…… our duty does not include chores!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The more peaceful it was, the more discontent my brothers and companions were.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The other day, too. The bandit and ferocious monster extermination are left to the samurai, and we Shinobi have a stand-by order named Logistic Support……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naturally, we know that forest better than anyone else because we use it every day for training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We should have rushed faster than anyone else and solved it faster than anyone else. And yet, just to keep us waiting, they caused unnecessary damage!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ninja is an existence in the shadows. Therefore, we were treated as lesser than Samurai Warriors of the Kingdom on the front lines.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, being fueled by the continuous peace and accompanying the reduction of armaments, and the Kingdom Samurai who wanted to prove the significance of their existence by taking the initiative to solve the occasional big incidents, took up the credit and the treatment of us Shinobi declined quickly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, ninjas. I brought you a mission. The budget has finally been approved, and it’s been decided that a new Kingdom Samurai Dormitory will be built this time. You will get cleaning and moving done promptly. If you’re a ninja, you’re good at that, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even the samurai, who were once on friendly terms like comrades and sworn allies, use them as booths, and the ninja changed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh……? Changing jobs? What do you mean, Macura? You finally graduated to genin only to say…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, Shinobu-chan. My parents aren’t feeling well… It’s a little tight with my current shinobi salary…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so… yet, how? There are many who change jobs these days, but those people, are they proven? You’ve only just graduated from the Ninja Academy, you never had a track record, and yet you’re just moving to another carrier…ah, you, no way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Daimyo, Osanaski, is also friendly with the Kingdom’s Samurai Generals… I asked for a favor. The way I asked… I’ll leave it to your imagination, and I despise it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Macura…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu-chan… Don’t be like me… Stay pure as you are forever.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were a lot of friends who wanted to change jobs, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the employment rate of the kingdom samurai is currently severe, and even if they wish to change jobs, they are competing for seats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were many who used whatever means to win their seats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I had to admit the fact that me, my companions, and elder brothers did not want to admit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The age of the Shinobi is over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is the Shinobi way to dedicate this body in service to the lord and the country… but the world no longer needs Shinobi …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One day, no one could object to the words Nii-san had sadly muttered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But even so, this power that I earned still… can certainly be of use somewhere in the world. I don’t hate peace. However, I want to use this acquired power to the fullest and use it for something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A dozen ninja, including me, who agreed with my brother’s complaints and wishes, received the words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let us go out into the world. Instead of changing jobs, I’ll retire, then seek re-employment… why don’t we become free hunters, and go across the world?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And we went out to the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In search of something that can fully use the power that I have acquired as a shinobi.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Currently, I am…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I’m not going to let you go, Shinobu!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, not good, this range…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Where are you going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered a time long ago. In that instant, he stepped in fast and was in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike us, who train to kill our emotions and always keep calm in battle, this boy bares his fighting spirit and emotions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surrounded by beautiful, lively green light, he hunts me down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Japone Fluid Art… Mawashi Uke(Circular Block)!” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, can you handle my flicker?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast! Not to mention that I am not confident in martial arts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this wild, yet speedy, relentless fist strike far exceeds my reaction rate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Up to now, I am undefeated against opponents of my age, even among the samurai.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t beat him in this distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t think he could use such a powerful technique to blow away even the fog.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraaaaa!! Quickly, get beat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When we played Go in town, he was stronger than anyone in my hometown, his plays took to far-reaching heights that existed in a different dimension, and left a ‘yearning’ in me rather than a sense of ‘wonder’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to play with him more. I even desire to become a disciple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, his impression in a real battle is completely different from what he showed while playing Go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong, soulful, and fiery.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why he can play such a game of Go, but I’m sure this is the real him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘Ugh! uh!—urgh! It’s, too fast…Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t keep my distance. Before I step forcefully into it and try to back-step, his high speed left flies to stop me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I try to keep parrying a fist that moves like a whip with both hands, but gradually my arms become numb and I can’t keep up with the fists that accelerate even more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Got you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 One left hand overwhelmed me, and after I was in a state unable to defend or evade, he threw his right fist straight into my face… indeed… if I take this right, I’m……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… My win! Right!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was prepared for defeat, but the shock that should have come did not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His fist stopped right before my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time the light that was covering his body subsides.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What do you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh, I think it’s enough for a match now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was prepared to lose my face, but what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mercy? No, that’s not it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is…… Oh…… That’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… are strong, but…… well, you’ve never hit a woman.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… assuredly…… you’re a very well-bred boy… but…… for a woman who’s determined and resolved herself, it’s not kindness! It’s insulting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Humiliation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The battlefield is next to death. Death on duty is also a Shinobi’s pride.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can you not hit me because I’m a woman? A sweet spirituality to that degree with such strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With such bloodlust, I thought I might have to deal with losing my virginity to him, but I was disappointed. [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Take…eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the outcome, just admit your loss, and beat it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seized me by the wrist, as I took a chance to thrust a Kunai into his throat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, at this distance……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You get it? If I can see it, it’s mine! I won’t miss your line of sight, breathing, and muscle movements. No matter what you do, I’ll stop it and hit the counter before you can do anything!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I —”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, accept your defeat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His wild eyes amaze me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…But…you didn’t actually hit me, did you? No, you never hit me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… Hey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t play around. Are you mocking me with this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was more upset with his treatment of girls in this situation rather than my defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s saying it was unseemly to be so unwilling to admit defeat, even I thought it was shameful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to challenge the authority of the winner, to whom my life or death is entrusted, if he gives me defeat, I demanded that I be beaten down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then he…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up! Well, if you want me to hit you, you should come at me with an uglier face! Yours is hard to hit! Roughly, women like you say whatever they want to judge a man, that he’s no good for his own convenience, that they should stop dating him, that he’s a pervert for reading one erotic book, some say he’s the worst if he hurts a woman, yet you say it’s an insult, so annoying. Even though you openly claimed I was your type a little while ago, now of your own accord I’m a disappointment, every one of you, so shallow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Right then, this boy of my age got emotional. His complaint feels like it’s about a quarrel with a female classmate as he rattled on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A man doesn’t live on the basis of a woman’s evaluation. This is my way, I’ve only just met you, let alone as an enemy who won’t listen to other people’s arguments yet finds faults, get lost already!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was dumbfounded, but quickly got angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I twist my wrist and he lets go on reflex. Just a little. A little distance, and a chance of victory still stands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-What do you mean come at you with an uglier face… how rude! Women and men… it’s what’s inside, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, a chance. His response was delayed because he kept rattling in anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I back-stepped to gain some distance from him. If it’s this range, I can cope with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, you’ll receive my strongest ninjutsu! Water Art! Wind Art! Composite Ninjutsu, 【FengShui Calamity】―――” [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In battle, it is essential to be calm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To not understand that, he still has a long way to go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s inside… so, even you declare that it’s the state of what’s inside that’s important! At least…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having been separated from me again, he did not hastily give chase, but cried out with an emotional outburst.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At least the friend I just met… is a scary faced Ogre and yet… what’s inside… is a kinder person than anybody else.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems he’s shouting not just in anger, in some respects it’s as if to appeal to reason……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And the master I met… the worst, most cursed, infamous being in history … but what’s inside… he hates to lose, he’s a little childish, but he’s my guide and he’s the one who acknowledges me more than anyone else!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What is he talking about? Who’s the kind Ogre? Master?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the eyes say…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Someone who can only see Mr. Aka as one of the ogre race, shouldn’t talk about what’s inside of a person!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed like he was screaming to me, no, into the world, ‘Why don’t you understand me?’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, his entire body is once again wrapped in green light, and the spiral of a compact size than before appears in the right arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The spiral strikes head-on toward the strongest ninjutsu that I have unleashed, and makes a hole.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Earth Impact!! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shock wave from the spiral shattered my art and blew me away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a strong, hot, intense impulse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… shu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fallen, I lie on my back on the ground, so there isn’t much trauma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, my heart had already admitted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s my total loss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I admit… my defeat…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s much more refreshing than I felt a while ago, and above all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This, I… got hit like I wanted, by the man who says he only gets violent with ugly women… and… huh? Me? I mean…… he said he couldn’t hit me, I’m not an ugly woman.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My heart couldn’t stop racing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I, of all people, should listen to others more often.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So maybe I should listen to him better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I thought I had to listen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… before you listen to me… tell me. First…… what’s your name?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we’ve clashed like this, I still don’t know his name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Different terms were used for the first 2 but couldn’t find single English words for them, so I fell back on Naruto.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] The [Mawashi Uke] is a [roundhouse block] found most often in traditional forms of Karate
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Say what now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Feng shui (pronounced fung shway) is an ancient Chinese system of balancing our physical environment to promote harmony and a sense of well-being. The Chinese words “feng” and “shui” translate to mean “wind” and “water,” respectively.
