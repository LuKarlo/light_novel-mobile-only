 “The Great Demon King Tre’ainar”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To put it bluntly, there is no one who doesn’t know that name. That name appears in textbooks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I have never seen that entity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are no pictures of him left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King, once defeated by my father and his companions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way am I seeing his ghost, must be some sort of strange vision.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it might have actually been a dream.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surely, I was somewhat frustrated and saw something weird.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little Man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I regained consciousness, and realized I was in bed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This ceiling is my room, I guess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the first thing I saw was Sadiz’s face, which didn’t have her usual nasty smile and looked at me teary eyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank goodness, Lil’ Earth! I’m glad…… you’re okay, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I was hugged tight. Sweet, lovely Boobs!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, ah, S-Sadiz? Oh, Um… Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t you remember? Lil’ Earth fainted on his own within the sealed room. I didn’t know the cause, I couldn’t find any trauma, and I didn’t know what was going on… I thought, what if something happens to Little man’s body while he was following me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’m okay… it’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How are you feeling? Do you have any issues?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m fine… a little light headed… but…… yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s sweet scent was comforting. Then Sadiz slowly got herself off me and smiled gently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If nothing is wrong, then alright.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, let’s make children already.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Maybe it’s really just exhaustion. Even if you couldn’t beat the princess, Lil’ Earth was working hard every day. Please take a good rest today. I’ll bring your meal later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Sadiz, a little longer…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How-e-ver♪, sleeping together, I-re-fuse ♪.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Sadiz’s smile changed from one that cared for me from the bottom of her heart and returned to her usual nasty smile, and then she went straight out of the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I guess she’s relieved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, I don’t know what caused this, but I haven’t seen Sadiz in obedience mode for a long time, so I wanted more and more of this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah! To behold of such blissful innocence… indeed the seed of the one who defeated me has gone feeble…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nuwha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And suddenly, a voice echoed in my head. That’s the voice I heard before I lost consciousness. And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be surprised. Tis my spirit form. As such, I cannot harm or touch anything. However…… you alone can see my appearance and hear my voice.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, with a faint presence, was definitely the demon I saw before I lost consciousness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it doesn’t seem to have much substance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wan, I want to ask… you’re like a ghost, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. After being destroyed by the heroes, including your father, I was unable to pass on, hence I gained a spirit body and was bound to that sword. As soon as Hiro’s life became peaceful, he sealed his sword in that meager space. Never have I been out of that room or seen anyone in the last decade.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, why can you talk with me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. I know not.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it is a spiritual body, his figure looks thin. However, he exudes a strange aura just by being there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, if everything he says is true…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you… putting aside being a ghost… you…… really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… it’s, are you really the Great Demon King Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This isn’t good! Wait a minute, what’s this? You mean I’m haunted by the ghost of the Great Demon King now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wait a damn minute, usually you haunt the person who kills you!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why bother with the son instead of the Hero himself?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? Am I going to be haunted forever…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child… you seem considerably perplexed, even I do not know how this situation came about, despite my omnipotence. No matter how much a child like you deliberates, no solution will present itself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hu-wha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Rather, I am weary after the days spent in captivity this past decade. I would see a bit of the world after my demise. Child, go out to the city. Then I can go outside. In fact, that I could not exit this room is due to you staying in like this.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The self-proclaimed Great Demon King issues his orders to me. To be honest, I can’t determine if all this is real or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, being told to go out all of a sudden… well, having been in that small room for more than ten years without anyone to talk to, I’m sure I’d seek my freedom through death.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But he’s a ghost, so he won’t die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would certainly be hell! So if I could go outside, I would want to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although, even if you’re the Great Demon King, why do you think you can order me around?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hah! What omnipotence… You lost to my father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hnn…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying something I knew he would find unpleasant, seems to have worked well. Unexpectedly!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The legendary Great Demon King raised his eyebrows at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『H, huh- … Now listen here… son of Hiro.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, the Great Demon King is also short-tempered. You’re going to let a little ribbing from a kid get to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, since you can only talk, but can’t harm me, I’ll decide what I’m going to do. Don’t give me any orders.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because my opponent is in a situation where his hands and feet are tied, I feel sorry for him. But, if the other party is really a Great Demon King, then this is an opportunity of a lifetime, I have to stand my ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, my words made the Great Demon King Tre’ainar glare at me, as his neat face twitched.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… Ignorant of my terror. Is that right? To address me in such manner. I, the All-Powerful Demon King. Even as a spirit, I can rectify this matter! Could I not annihilate you with my power, and swallow this world into the Demon’s abyss once more?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you were trapped in a room because you couldn’t do that, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『………… Hu… Oh… Well… umm… Well, that is… t- tis not… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, is he bewildered for the first time in ten years? Did the Great Demon King, who almost destroyed the world, just lost an argument to an Academy student?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King suddenly got confused and was getting agitated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m starting to think this isn’t the Great Demon King, and I felt quite pitiful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, can’t be helped. Fine. I’ll take a walk before dinner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh!? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather, it’s just for a bit today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kokukoku Kokukoku!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I got out of bed and said so, the Great Demon King was joyously mumbling like a bright faced child.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, seems the dignity of the first Great Demon King is completely crushed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Oh, where are you going, Little Man?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, it seems you were talking to yourself, what are you up to? Is your current ailment a step in the plan to bed me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz came into the room after a light knock.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so startled that I jumped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see… to the people around me, do all the conversations with the Great Demon King sound like my monologue?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Furthermore, you changed clothes… what? You are to take a good rest today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no, a little walk in the city.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll blow you away, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Sadiz instantly got into the room and grabbed my cheeks and smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~ This maid…… she is formidable.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The voice of admiration from the Great Demon King. Yes, when she’s serious, she’s much stronger than the princess was today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why it’s a miserable story, my chances of winning right now is non-existent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu-fu-fu, most troubling, Little man. Today, I was intent on pampering my Lil’ Earth, feed him dinner myself, washing his body in the bath, might even overlook some mild sexual harassment in the bathroom. Alas…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? S-seriously!? No, un, I’ll behave! No, I’m really sick!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seems you’re doing well enough. So, having skipped the afternoon classes… Let’s have you solve all the problems I created about magic mathematics that would have been covered in this afternoon’s class!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiiiiiz!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re forbidden from leaving until everything is solved, else you’ll do without dinner. So, good luck? Try to escape… and… I have plenty to report.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz walked out of the room, leaving angry words promising punishment with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, if I had kept silent, I would have been in heaven. Instead I was knocked back down to hell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, The Great Demon King, Go To HELL!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, even if you say that… no…… yes…… well! My apologies.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, maybe I could have made progress with Sadiz today… instead, I get more work than usual… ah, damnit, but again…… Aaaaaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King, who has lost his dignity, apologized awkwardly to the cries from my heart that missed many delicious opportunities.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
