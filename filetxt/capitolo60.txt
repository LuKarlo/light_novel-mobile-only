 “Hey, tell me. What’s your name?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was quite the struggle, but finally I can take a break.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I can’t take it easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are still a lot of these guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s no telling what Mr. Aka might be going through.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, Mr. Aka. I’ll be right there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait a minute! Let’s talk, I’ll listen! So please, don’t go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, when I started running to Aka’s house, Shinobu, who should have been down, got up and ran around me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell, she’s still fine, her clothes got shredded by my shockwave, some shame would be nice, but now is not the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Goose Step】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took a goose step to avoid colliding with Shinobu, who stood in the way, and ran.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, just, I said wait!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Daaaaaah~, don’t order me around! Also, a lot of your figure is exposed as it is, your clothes are in tatters because of the effects of the shock wave, so if you don’t mind! Hide your panties!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not really, they’re made to be seen without issue! Beside, in that case you can look to your heart’s content, go on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Like there are panties in this world that it’s fine to see from the onset. I get excited to see it because you shouldn’t look at it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu is chasing right after me. The crazy nuisance. So annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Swab】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While moving straight, proceed to change direction so as to draw a circle outward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll shake her off at this rate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, I’m listening to you, aren’t I? You’re seriously saying that ogre is a friend!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now is the time! Your companions may be doing something to Mr. Aka, and don’t suddenly turn around and offer your hand!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t you trust me? Yes, we don’t know anything about each other. Then you can run, and listen to me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? It’s the other way around, right? These guys told me to listen to them yet had no ears to listen to me, and now they tell me to listen, but I’m reluctant to talk and kept on running.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only difference, I’m refusing but Shinobu kept screaming without a care.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m 15 years old from The Kingdom of Japone, the eldest daughter of the Stoke family. A genius ninja who was called Yojijukugo and a child prodigy. What’s more, my skills at playing Go won me the Japone under 18 tournament championship. The type of man I like is… how should I put it, the man I’m interested in right now is… No, I don’t have to say anymore, do I? Right? Right? Totally infatuated! The bloodlust from our battle, it’s now an exceedingly wonderful, heart throbbing memorial!” [1] [S1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-Infatuated, n-no woman says that so easily!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good. She’s beautiful, and she said I’m her type, but she’s kind of annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m flattered, but I may not want to be intimate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or why are you so energetic? You lost to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I take her to Mr. Aka’s place like this, wouldn’t it be dangerous?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, it’s the reason we can talk like this, also if you need to stop my brother, in that case I’ll help you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I didn’t have the time to talk to you. How long has it been since your brother went to Mr. Aka? Then, I’ll be faster if it’ll be one second earlier, too bad for you but I’ll blow your big brother away with haste!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I face forward, my cheeks and skin get cut by branches on the way, and proceed regardless.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I glanced back, but Shinobu was fine and she had no problem with…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the perfect parkour… as expected of a Jounin.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I would like you to show me such movement』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up! It’s been a while now! And I’m worried about Mr. Aka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Surely that ogre will be fine… Well, to be certain I am concerned, but…… it cannot be helped. Shall I offer a little assistance?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar was by my side thinking a little as he observed the situation while whispering into my ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well? Child. From now on, I shall direct you on the ‘route to run’. Follow my instructions. I will inform you on the best route to avoid obstacles.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-What? You can do that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm. Instead, try not to miss the route, will you? There are several route instructions. Memorize them at once.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how Tre’ainar explains the route to me. About short words and their basis.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey? You’ve been talking to yourself for a while? Hey, hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ignoring the chasing Shinobu, I concentrate on remembering Tre’ainar’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as I enter the deep, wooded area, I increase my concentration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you all right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It looks like this, and there is no doubt about the instructions from the one once said to be the best commander in history!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know, but I asked!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Let us proceed… ‘Slant’』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Slant. Meaning the route cuts into an angle diagonally after running straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just barely avoid a large tree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Corner』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Corner. The instruction is to cut diagonally to the right after running straight for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Straight』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the name implies, keep running straight. There’s nothing to hinder me for a while, and I can run through non-stop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what? How did he? A swifter running course…can’t catch up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Gradually, the gap from Shinobu’s feet, which trainer called the perfect parkour, was expanding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jig Out』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Incredible. As I ran, I pondered, ‘Which way should I run?’ and I thought about it, but my idea was completely different from Tre’ainar’s instructions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I realize my judgment still needs work.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But thanks to that, I gained some distance from the disturbed woman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re truly amazing. I respect you! But that’s why you have to wait! You say you’ll blow my brother away, but…… no matter what you do in the first place, you can’t beat Nii-san!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the words I heard from behind made me a little angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nii-san is much stronger than I am. Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, Experience, all top-class talent even among the Jounin. A genius shinobi who was recognized for his ability by the Seven Heroes of legend, and ‘prized’ as the pride of the Japone Kingdom!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh~, yeah yeah, genius prodigy, I’m boundlessly envious. Me, I’ve never been recognized by the Seven Heroes even once, so I dropped out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Great Demon King who was the nemesis of the Seven Heroes recognized me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, never mind that …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are close.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally approached a familiar place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I met the shooting star family and Mr. Aka around here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And if you leave here, you’ll soon be in Aka’s lair…? what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar! There’s some smoke…And, uh…Is it burning?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Most Likely.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Probably not. No doubt. The smoke is spreading, and the air is gradually getting hot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it comes into view. The house I spent last night in. That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s burning… Aka’s house… the devastation… Aka’s field…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The surrounding trees are destroyed, the ground is devastated, and it was no longer a place where anyone could live…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not ask how…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what caught my eye wasn’t the burning, the devastation, or ‘their extent’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The blood spread abundantly on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Kunai and shuriken stuck all over the place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An audible groan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, a dying figure, so weak that it seems about to expire at any time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted to doubt the sight before me as simply a dream.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But all the air I feel on my skin tells me that this is real.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Phew…… Dear me…… as I said…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar alone is not so surprised. He is calm as if he expected, ‘this outcome isn’t anything strange’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was the only thing I could squeeze out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve caught up. Eh? …… eh!? This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Shinobu finally caught up, she was surprised at the sight which spread before her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is only natural.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because these are Shinobu’s friends… And, and Shinobu’s big brother may be among them, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu’s friends and Shinobu’s big brother.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bloodstained, lying flat down and on the verge of dying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ni, nii-san…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, there is one figure looking down on the people laying prostrate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To touch the dragon’s reverse scale. To step on the tiger’s tail. I say truly… they provoked the ogre’s horn…… they are at fault.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was big, thick, had many shuriken, kunai, swords, sickles, and other weapons stuck to its body, and a lot of blood was shed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the existence does not seem to show pain to the injury either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The whole body is dyed in a scorching color, hair standing upright as it was on the verge of boiling with rage, and horns that extend majestically.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked exactly like a monster.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No matter how kind of a person, anger has a tipping point. Even among you humans, there are those who when pushed, kill even their blood-relatives. So…… naturally the ogre was pushed, too. And, an enraged ogre becomes a blood-stained beast’ next, and loses all control of their emotions and self-restraint. Right…… that ogre… tis no devil, but…… tis definitely an ogre.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What am I looking at now?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――I do… one person at a time… making friends… having fun, playing games, having them over for a meal… ah, like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh…Urgaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! Ha, ha, ha, ha, Humaaannns!! Unforgivabuuuuullllee!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The house where he lived in and the fields he tended have all been ruined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure all the works that were in the house were burned up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s no one who wouldn’t get angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even I would flip out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Much more, if you’re attacked unprovoked, there isn’t the slightest problem with striking back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve come this far by kicking Shinobu out of the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it doesn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can’t be helped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But yet I couldn’t say that right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This is the turning point, child… your solution once again… show me as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar talked as if he had seen through my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is, though my friend Mr. Aka is screaming with that much bloodlust, I must once again try to reach him with words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Yojijukugo, 才色兼備, is a four character compound which refers to (a woman) being gifted with both intelligence and beauty​. A lady of Wit and Beauty if you will. I considered using Diva or Idol but that just makes her out like a singer. Also a note to dat Princess, this is how you raise your appeal as a heroine. Though Shinobu is coming on Pretty strong.
