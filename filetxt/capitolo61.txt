 “Ya buuurned iiiiiiitt!! I didn’t doooo nothing, ta yaaaaa! But why? The house! The field I worked hard ta raise! My crops! What made ya ruin them, whyyyyyy!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just a scream, like a violent storm blowing through, and if I get careless, it would blow me away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, Mo…ster —”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, a man who was in tatters at Mr. Aka’s feet looked up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That time, at the guild in town wasn’t it, the man who called himself ‘Fuuma’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nii-san!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Shh… Shino… bu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I was taken aback by Shinobu’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Shinobu’s big brother… that was said to be a genius… suffered such damage!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do ya know how hard it is ta build a house!? Find a quiet place, down the trees by yerself, cut wood, pile it up, and if ya think yer done it at last, rain and wind come, break it easy and ya start over, think about it, and do yer best ta make it work!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Mr. Aka grabs the dying Fuuma’s neck and lifts him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do ya know how hard it is to grow vegetables in the field? Find a good sunny spot, too much rain will wither them and even if I take my eyes off, birds and animals would eat them, but I am glad that it grows little by little. and it’s good…Why do ya do this!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka is furious. His expression is ferocious…… No, it’s filled with red tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why did ya do iiiiiiiiiiit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, that sincere cry, wrenched at my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did this happen? You shouldn’t have done anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka did nothing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Like that, don’t, play yourself as the victim… you ogre… how many have you destroyed, wounded, slain, ravaged, and violated among those who lived peacefully…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Fuuma, who was seized by the neck, hit Mr.Aka with his words while holding on to his life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were words directed to the existence of ‘ogre’ rather than ‘Aka’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As emotions go… so little made you enraged…… attempting to eliminate such dangers…… what’s wrong with it! Such as a beast that doesn’t recognize itself as dangerous, depart from this world!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, a glint in the dying Fuuma’s eye held his strength, and he tried to do something with his hands folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That, he’s using the Seal(Hand Signs) Shinobu was performing earlier.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not good, Mr. Aka, watch out ――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I regretted my delay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I had talked to Aka without being scared earlier…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fire Art, 【Flame Cannon Blast(Blazing Chorus) 】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A huge flame emanated from Fuuma’s mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka was bathed with a tremendous amount of heat that burned and melted everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Mr. Aka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re exposed to such a big flame, normally…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Unforgivable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Mr. Aka isn’t normal. He’s much stronger than I imagined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The skin, which had been dyed by scorching heat, became even darker and eventually became completely jet black.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The color of the whole body changed, as if the skin he wore was broken through and the real skin underneath exposed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the sharp horns underwent an ominous transformation, and the eyes became sharper and more violent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugaogaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Aka I knew, was not there anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gugaraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuuurghh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ogre, who completely took off the veil, threw Fuuma with all his might.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His body hits the ground and is violently convulsing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ogre flies toward an immobile Fuuma and tries to step on him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No-Not good. Nii-san!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu quickly enters the scene and flies off with Fuuma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the ogre landed hard on the ground, breaking the ground with its strength and opening a huge hole, and the ground shook like an earthquake had occurred.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he had received something like that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaaaaaa… Ugaaaaaaaaa!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he never stopped. The eyes of the beast no longer see anything, they just rampage as if they were destroying everything on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-this is bad… Nii-san, everybody, we’ll retreat for the time being!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu… but…and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re in no shape. Right now, there’s nothing to say in this situation with our downed companions!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, Shinobu shouted at me that I should run away now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Friends?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『There is no end to it. It cannot even hear your voice anymore. All consciousness and thought is lost, and it will not stop until all around is destroyed. Tis that kind of race.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even though, tis surprising. I knew he was powerful, but did not know much about the owner of that power, so he did not leave a name for himself in history… he is comparable to the top-ranking officer of the Demon Army ‘Demon General Rokuha’, is he not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From Tre’ainar’s mouth, the rampaging ogre… no, Aka’s power. The power line’s up with the owners of the legendary title that even I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you know what that means? Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… If he rampages with such power…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Not so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why do you think, with all that strength, he was buried from knowledge? If I had known that a man of such power existed, I would have made him a senior executive of the Demon King’s Army with exceptional treatment.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t answer that question. Then, with a sad look, Tre’ainar looked towards the rampaging Aka…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He is probably a former Demon King soldier, but… all through his life, never unleashed himself in a fit of rage… without using that power in a flashy manner…… he is not one to lose himself in instinctual violence… somehow continually supporting his livelihood, it seems… somewhere without divergence…… after the war, endured on his own and lived quietly.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『He is certainly an ogre. The fate of the race cannot be reversed. But still… after all, that ogre might have had a special heart. But that too…… stupid ones have ruined everything.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. He had that much power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be clear, more than anyone I’ve ever come across except my father, his power evokes an overwhelming chill.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If he feels like it, he could do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He could easily destroy or rule over one or two cities.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Aka didn’t make a name for himself in the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So even Tre’ainar didn’t know about Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I care not about the past anymore… tis too late… no voice can reach him anymore… until the rampage ends.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, now, I don’t know what kind of life Mr. Aka has led.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is important is what I do now by seeing this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, child… What will you do?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar once again tries to ask me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s asking me to show my answer again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m scared of Aka’s transformation…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goodness … really, I am… useless”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was scared of Aka’s powers, he’s more powerful than I expected… I was afraid … I dangerously came close to doing the same thing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I remembered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You pointed out a boomerang to me last night, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The boomerang that Tre’ainar pointed out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I used Tre’ainar’s technique, and my father and everyone in the Imperial city despised me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To those guys, I spit up, ‘Don’t bring up the war of the past’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, when I was surprised last night by the fact that Aka might be a former Demon King soldier, Tre’ainar grinned and said, ‘are you concerned about the war that ended before you were born’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the same as that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because I used unexpected power …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was also yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The more fear you see in the face of your loved ones, the more you hurt…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s outcry in the match comes to mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I will never forget her expression at the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I can’t let Aka taste the same thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t be scared. Don’t give up. Rather step on!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stepped forward and finally called to Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you!? What are you doing!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… He…… surely…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu, who was about to leave the scene, quickly tried to stop me, but I stepped forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Aka turns and looks at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Grr?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka… I’m sorry I’m late… it was hard… I’m sorry… The cake, too… I messed it up somehow.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gugaaaaaaaaahh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka, who has forgotten himself in his rage, can’t seem to recognize me anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even when he saw me, he just raised a roar like a beast and started attacking me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast. Reflexively activated breakthrough to defend. However, even in the breakthrough state, Aka’s powerful arm blows me away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, tah…ah, Mr. Aka…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My back crashed into a tree, numbing my whole body, and stopping my breath for a moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… he’s kind…… with skillful hands, a good cook… and yet, so strong… Mr. Aka… amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fast and strong. The breakthrough state was wiped out in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is Mr. Aka’s true power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s why I can’t run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s okay, Aka. Mr. Aka did nothing wrong. Even humans go wild when they get angry and snap. They hit things, destroy them, and abuse their parents… Mr. Aka… he’s just a little stronger than other people… What you’re doing is normal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka swung his fist toward me as I got up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A ridiculous right strong swing. If I get hit straight, I’ll be splattered into pieces of meat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But strangely, I had no fear at this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The angle of Aka’s fist and the movement of his muscles came to me naturally, and I was able to evade without using the breakthrough this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry… because we humans are too weak…… our mind is too narrow… even though Mr. Aka is such a big guy… he said he wanted to be friends with us…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Urgh! Gaaaah!! Grrraaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m really sorry… Mr. Aka… that’s why, I am!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, it is Aka’s left full swing. But before the punch, which was obviously too big, I thrust my right straight up Aka’s vacant face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A punch that projects out diagonally. It’s less powerful than a normal straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it struck like a counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ga, ah… Gaaaaaaahhh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka took a blow from me, but he doesn’t look frightened. Even if I hit him with the counter, this is it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only power, but also the hardness and toughness of the body are clearly different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you’re going to fight, theoretically it’s best to take a good distance and fight with speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is not a battle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka is too strong… If he gets a little violent, it’s disastrous to humans… you can’t even have an argument with each other… really, it’s a lot, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugaaraaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I at least… when Mr. Aka gets angry, I’ll be the opponent who can fight him openly. And I’ll make you feel refreshed! To the point where Mr. Aka can vent his anger! I’ll face this Mr. Aka, not only the one who’s kind!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not a battle. It’s a fight. It’s not a fight to win, it’s a fight to hit at your opponent’s thoughts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To reach Mr. Aka who loses himself and rages.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such is my answer, to Tre’ainar’s inquiry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that your answer?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Why do you go so far? After all, you just met this ogre yesterday, right?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes. But…… the ogre I just met…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why am I here? My answer was simple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― still, isn’t he the son of the hero?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―it’s not a skill used by warriors
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― Warrior disqualification!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― Permanent expulsion from the warrior world!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All the voices that I have been bathed with until now are words directed at ‘The Son of the Hero’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My life up to this point, praise and criticism were all words said towards my title.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the ogre I just met yesterday… Mr. Aka…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ― Earth, you’re amazing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He knows nothing about my identity or title…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because he said the words I wanted the most in my life.”
