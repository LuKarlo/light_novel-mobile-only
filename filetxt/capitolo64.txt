<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My first life-threatening battle. Now that I think about it, I wonder how stupid and reckless it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the first time in my life, I was proud of myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m somewhat hopeless. Even though I’m my parent’s son, I have no talent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Disqualified as the son of a Hero.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A failure who couldn’t live up to everyone’s expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shut my ears to all those words, threw out the foul language to everyone, and ran away from the home I was born and raised in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And today, I am myself for the first time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Night?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I opened my eyes, it was already night… My head is in pieces!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ou, urgh… iyaa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything inside and outside feels broken, it’s practically broken… my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I unintentionally tried to massage it, I found that my head was covered with bandages.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the head, but also the fist and the whole body was treated……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Did ya just wake up?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Under the starry sky, I was laid on a straw covered surface, and when I got up, there was Mr. Aka, cooking something in a pot under a fire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka, did you give me treatment?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it wasn’t me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it was Mr. Aka, but then who?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That group that attacked me… it was the young girl. She put a lot of ointment on it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Shinobu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That girl… she treated me very carefully.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The guys who attacked… I can’t trust em… but that girl… she even kneeled on the ground, asking me ta let her care for Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not just me. Mr. Aka was also bandaged up… I see… she……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That girl, is she Earth’s woman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, no! Not at all! Definitely wrong.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was almost confessed to, but it’s still unclear after all. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, she’s a beautiful woman, and a pity about her chest, but she wasn’t that bad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was my ‘first time’ having a woman ‘Fall in love’ with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But she told me ta give this ta Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Mr. Aka handed me something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was like a book, and on the cover it says:
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… an Exchange diary?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is. Ta hand it ta Earth without fail, said ya’d understand?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Exchange diary. Come to think of it, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something you do with a sweetheart. That is, to exchange diaries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is so only two people can exchange what they cannot usually say out loud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, if at the end of the notebook, a small ‘I like’ is written, it’ll make me jump up and down on a bed making a fuss.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To that extent, it was a sacred act for me, as if I were on a date in the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even though… that girl, we’re not in that kind of relationship… what should I do…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was shocked when I turned the diary around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thereupon, on the first page all of a sudden, words that completely filled the page were written.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!? What the? Um… 「I heard your name. But I haven’t written your name here yet. Because I want you to formally introduce yourself to me, I’d like to call your name again, after telling me from your mouth. Well, you showed me your manly figure. I, my brother, and my comrades, too, deeply regret our shallowness and apologize to you and your friend for making such an unforgiving mistake. I’m so sorry.」……what a serious apology.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 More precisely it’s an exchange diary, something like a letter, and a written apology.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. The child didn’t do nothing, but…… I said she didn’t have ta write the apology.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, she had a strange personality, tended to be annoying and some odd times, but she’s not a bad fellow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This message conveys her feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… uh? 「I fell in love with you, as I think you already know. To be honest, I want to cross that line right away. If you feel like it, please call me. I’ll come running in two seconds.」 O, wha, Hey…” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! It quickly turned ta a love letter. Earth, ya real popular. How sweet and sour.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly a surprise attack love confession… I might be ashamed, glad and embarrassed… And, Aka is smiling, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, that girl… ah~, what now? 「But if you want to get to know each other more, I’ll respect that, and I hope we start by getting to know each other like this. 」 … huh… good grief, she really~… uh huh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a bit awkward at her clumsy effort to seriously get closer to me, even though she seemed a little embarrassed as I turned the page…

 This…… There’s still more than half of it left. [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That…… Somehow, there are terrible questions and blank answers… What? What? You want me to answer these?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S-Scary. I’m scared! What’s this? How many questions are there? I mean, towards the end…… Where would you build a grave? What is this!? Scaryyyy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly I felt a chill and was horrified. No, no, no, it’s impossible, impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Awesome Earth! As expected, yer amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka, this is not something to praise! That girl’s a little, I mean, she’s quite weird!” [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For just a moment, she had my heart fluttering with joy, but before long a sense of panic came out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I concluded that I was afraid to read the diary any longer, so I closed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… erm, essentially Shinobu…… did they?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wrecked remains of Aka’s house and fields have been tidied up a little, but they were nowhere to be seen.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, while I was collapsed, I’m relieved that Mr. Aka was not attacked again or anything like that, but I’m worried about what happened afterwards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They left, went down the mountain. That girl and the others were touched by Earth’s brave figure… they said they were foolish.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They wanted ta make amends for the house, the field, and so on. But, I said no. that they should just go already.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Really……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I guess it’s no use apologizing now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, Mr. Aka didn’t retaliate in return, he didn’t get involved anymore it seems.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, I’m not going ta live here anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka said that and laughed, and I was happy about it, and I laughed, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, you won’t! You’re going around the world, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The proposal I made before I fell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Let’s team-up and travel the world together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka accepted the words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so happy about that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, where do we go? I’ve never been far away from Imperial City. I only know it as knowledge. I’ve seen it in books, the domain at the bottom of the sea, the country above the clouds, or the Demon Realm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That is. Clouds and the sea are fairy tales, but…… The Demon Realm… I left the Demon King Army, I’ll never go back home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so? Or rather, Mr. Aka, you quit the Demon King army… no…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I almost heard it, but I stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t matter anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t ask until Mr. Aka talks about it himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t care about the past, I said that just yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. After all this, it should be enough for today, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mr. Aka had a gentle face, yet he said, ‘Let’s call it a day’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it would be fun to talk about what to do from now on, but the moment he suggested it, I was already at my limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I’m getting sleepy again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it. Aren’t you hungry?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no… actually, not that much… but if you’ve made something…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, yer too tired, it won’t go ta yer stomach. The soup will be there tomorrow morning, so today ya should rest.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Aka put out the fire on the pot he had been boiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the area suddenly darkened, but we could still recognize each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the stars were shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, today… was really amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, but I don’t know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ya were, Thank ya. Ah, sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mr. Aka… let’s not do that anymore, okay? I simply did what I did…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… That…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so, Mr. Aka dropped his big body on the spot next to me with a bang, and we looked up at the night sky together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth… are ya not prejudiced against the demons?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At first, of course, ya thought I was an enemy at the time, but, ya trusted me right away… today, ya worked so hard for me. Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mr. Aka asked me while looking at the stars next to me. A simple question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yesterday, I made a joke about being a disciple of the Great Demon King… but why did I do that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was not joking about Tre’ainar though.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I’m not prejudiced against the demons? No, that’s not the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I haven’t experienced the war, also the presence of Tre’ainar… after all……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no prejudice… I’m human, but…… maybe it’s because I don’t really like people.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In that sense, demon or human, they would be fine … if it was someone who sees me …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was saying that, and though I was sad, I still said so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was raised without any inconvenience, a blessed young master in a good environment… but I understood I was a bad kid… I was unable to meet the expectations of others …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…That’s all I wanted… my classmates made a big fuss about me saying what I should be … they pushed the invisible title on their own, and it followed around all the time like a curse… It was so painful … no one … saw me as ‘just Earth ‘.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My life so far. And it was in the previous match that everything became decisive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I ran away because I couldn’t stand it anymore… I threw abusive words and said I would never come back again… Run away… And I got lost in the forest… I met Mr. Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Is that right …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. So…… Even in the short time we met… the first time someone said I was purely ‘amazing’… it was a demon, an Ogre… I thought I’d definitely had to do something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I don’t think I would have come up with that idea if I hadn’t met Tre’ainar in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If not, I would have stayed in Imperial City forever, still compromising on the disappointing evaluation of others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there are times when you just go out into the world for a little while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt very troubled in a very narrow world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s… ah, I’ve been living on the Surface world for more than ten years… Earth is the only one ta say that…… ta able ta meet Earth… is a miracle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In that sense, the only human lying down and talking while looking up at the stars with an ogre, including the Surface and the Demon Realm, is probably just me. That’s a miracle!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, we laughed. We were laughing purely and sincerely like children.

 “Well… let’s go to bed today… wake up tomorrow… then think a lot about the future! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll be talking about it forever if I stay like this, but let’s do it tomorrow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s so much to talk about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, today I’m too tired as expected… Oh, as soon as I realized that I went to sleep …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Like that… say no… still, tha… asking.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmmm?! Mr. Aka… What was that… I’m already sleepy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… ta meet… wanted ta be friends with… help me out…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah~, because soon, we’ll team-up after this, there’s no point in saying thank you to each and every little thing… Really, Mr. Aka…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 - Earth, thank ya
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? dazzling……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Blinds…What? Oh, no, it’s already morning!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? I felt like I was asleep a while ago…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I fell asleep in an instant… Wow, the sun is already…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was just going to close my eyes a little, but it was already morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sun shined brightly, and we could hear the bird’s singing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, it wasn’t like early morning, it’s like I’ve been oversleeping…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Only that much got you exhausted it seems.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, Tre’ainar!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was talking with Mr. Aka last night, so I left Tre’ainar alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That? Are you sulking?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I woke up, Tre’ainar sat with an extremely serious expression and was gazing at something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a pot of soup made by Mr. Aka, which was left uneaten yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tre’ainar, did you …? What is this paper?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I noticed something on the lid of the pot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a piece of paper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was this there yesterday?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, tis addressed to you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not knowing what it was, I took the paper, and it read “To Earth”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A letter?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell is this? …… I know, yes, Mr. Aka’s already up…Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, rather than the letter, I looked around thinking Mr. Aka was sleeping next to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah …… Where’s Mr. Aka?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Mr. Aka wasn’t there any longer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Dude, how much clearer does she need to make it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
