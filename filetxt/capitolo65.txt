 “Earth… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth. Are yer injuries okay? Actually, I’m really worried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, at that time I didn’t even know myself, but now I remember clearly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, I hit Earth so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I also remember that for some reason, Earth did his best for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’ve fought against humans, but I’ve never had a quarrel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, with no hate, with no will ta kill, ya put yer life on the line for my sake, no member of the Demon race would have done that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was happy ya played with me, ate my meal, and invited me ta go on a trip together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I didn’t have a reliable companion in the Demon King’s Army, and I was alone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was small, I lived in the dark elf village of the Demon Realm, not with the Ogres.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Ogre of the Demon Realm is expected to have power, become a soldier, become a bodyguard, do the hard labor. Mother and Father are friends with Dark Elves and work as bodyguards for the village.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was kind, peaceful, and I thought we would be happy forever.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the war with humans ruined everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both Dark Elves and Ogres were drafted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even with my father and mother, I joined a unit led by General Hakuki of the Demon Army, where I met other Ogres for the first time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I was scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He mercilessly wounded and bruised those who surrendered, and in the end, killed and buried them alive with laughter, destroying villages, cities, and countries, and setting fire ta them at the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what the people who attacked me yesterday are saying is wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s sad they say that Ogres are ‘that kind of race’, but I can deny it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Father and mother also changed. They both looked the same as the other Ogres and were just rampaging.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth, I’m sure ya’ll tell me, ‘That’s not true’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it is,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I saw that, and pretend not ta see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t have the courage ta stop my friends and parents, so I couldn’t help humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All those humans died in front of me. Oh, I was right there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was on that day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just happened to see it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The day of the joint operation with other troops.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where all the dark elves, who were kind in our hometown, were killing humans with evil faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just like the Ogres, while laughing happily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seeing that, I knew. Ogres weren’t such a race originally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone has changed because of the ‘war’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was sad, bitter, and I almost cried.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someday, I might be fired up like that without meaning ta, I was scared just thinking so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, before I realized it, I escaped the demon army without permission, and I ran away from the war.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a traitor, and I couldn’t go back ta the Demon Realm anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard rumors in the wind, that my father and mother were dead, the dark elves were destroyed in the war, and my hometown was gone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The war would soon be over, but the remnants of the Demon King’s Army are still in the Demon Realm, and I’m still a traitor, nothing but.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I was hiding in the Surface world for so long.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But for more than ten years, I was lonely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted a friend ta stay with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that if I couldn’t go back ta the Demon Realm, I would just make friends with humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I soon realized that I was naive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was much harder to make friends with humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally. Just because the war was over, there was no reason for them ta accept me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what, I was afraid, I would run away, and gradually I tried calling out but they were too scared of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The truth is, when I met Earth, I was nervous and scared when I first called out ta him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I was really happy to be friends with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was the happiest I’ve ever been since I was alone, when ya said we would team-up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s why I can’t go on a journey with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’m an ogre after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ya can’t get into inns if I’m with ya. Ya can’t even go ta a food shop. Ya can’t even enter a town. I think many people will look at you with strange eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, if ya stay with me as it is, they may think that Earth is a bad person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I might hurt Earth again, like yesterday.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yer my only friend in the world, so I want ta bother Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth……… I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve lived in this mountain, in the forest for over ten years, but I never thought I’d go out in this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought I’d be kicked out by humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I didn’t think I’d go out for a human friend.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll miss ya, and I wish I could play more with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aka ―――――――――――――eh!!!!Where are you―――――! Aka―――――eh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Earth’s voice screaming loudly echoed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ya must have read the letter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sorry, Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why… Why is that? You said we’d go for an adventure together! Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He is frantically trying ta find me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m really sorry about this, Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m glad that Earth, a human, feels like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then, I go towards Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From my eyes… it was like yesterday… That’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t get it… tears… even at times like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sometimes I cry because I feel hopeless, lonely, scared, or sad.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But these tears are different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s lonely and sad, but that’s all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m crying with joy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… hang in there… don’t let anger control ya… be stronger… yes, I have ta be as strong as Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I’ll never forget Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank ya. Good luck.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of wiping away the tears, at the end I made a Peace Sign towards the mountain.
</div>
