<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how much I searched, I couldn’t find Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The letter left for me was about Aka’s feelings and his past.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lived in a Dark Elf village in the Demon Realm. He joined the Demon King’s Army in the war and was in a unit led by a great general who left a mark on history.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He couldn’t stand the misery of the war and how the people who had changed, so he ran away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he couldn’t travel with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I clenched the letter, I couldn’t help venting out my anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why didn’t you wake me up…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I complained to Tre’ainar sitting in front of me, facing the last pot of breakfast soup that Aka had left behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I respected his resolve. Also, he was the one whose life was ruined in the war that I led.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, why not? I don’t think Mr. Aka is a nuisance! Together, from here on…… a lot of things… as a team… we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, something came into my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, I continued.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s what Tre’ainar says to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『At present. However, there is no telling what the future will bring. The journey of an Ogre and a human traversing the world would be much too conspicuous, and the gazes much too strenuous.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care about the gazes around me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar would have known when Mr. Aka left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you had woken me up then, I might have stopped Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Did you, who cared more about the world’s view than anyone else, just say that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh… That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the boomerang pierces once again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed, you may not find it a nuisance if you travel together with him and get into trouble. You are tender-hearted…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-If that’s the case!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, for him, it might be heartbreaking. It may be harsh to say, but the public’s eyes are not as lenient as you think. Because he understands it better than anyone, he left.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t say anything back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aka and Tre’ainar were thinking more than I was, while I was just thinking that it would be fun to travel with Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The eyes around you do not matter? Do not make me laugh. No matter how aggressive your remarks, you who know nothing of the world, its people or of demons, have no basis. Tis unreliable.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I’m just talking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’m sure I’m right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know anything, I’m weak, and nothing I say is reliable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s what it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… if that’s the case…… that’s why…… as it is, Mr. Aka… isn’t the burden too much…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I understand what Tre’ainar is saying, but that’s too much for Aka to be saved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He didn’t do anything wrong, but was just kicked out of the house he originally lived in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… wrong…… Tis not the case.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t do anything after all. Tre’ainar, who read my mind, strongly denied it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child, tis no consolation. That ogre must have truly been saved by meeting you. You certainly became his friend. Tis why he is no longer before you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You know nothing of the world. You know not the depths of humans and demons. Your power is weak, as well. But… nevertheless, even though you were human, you befriended an Ogre. I am the first to witness such. Truly, you have done well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s words reached my heart, and that’s why I was so frustrated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I was stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A world in which me and Aka could walk around openly with no complaint from anyone… If only the world were like that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I believe… your father also shared a similar dream.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Instead of simply fighting against the demons with hatred, to go beyond the walls of demons and races, to see a world free of conflict, something-something… he said.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time I heard of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father did that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, by whatever means Hiro came to that concept… a dozen years after my death…… this is the status quo.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…well… well then!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I simply thought up an idea —
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the first place, I knew things would not go well. Rather, tis impossible. Absolutely.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hm… oh… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Friendship between individuals, like you and Aka is impossible, much less to achieve it on a tribal or global scale.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I said something like, ‘If my father can’t do it, then I will…’ Tre’ainar denied it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the first place, you and other humans fight against each other over differences of countries, races, cultures and even historical perceptions. Then, what of a difference of species? How can you strive in a world full of differences? Because it could not be done, war broke out.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And most difficult… tis impossible to draw the line on which race to make friendships with.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Draw a line. Tre’ainar tells me with a somewhat complicated expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For instance, you eat meat, do you not? One can survive even if they do not eat it. But you would still eat, would you not? So, are animals exempt from your friendship?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What you ate the other day…… the animal meat… where did the food come from? An animal? A beast? So, where are the demons from?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where to draw the line… I hadn’t really thought about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Usually, the rough case being…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With humans… we can have a conversation…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, beastmen and the like, myself included, can converse with animals and beasts. Some of them are connected by bonds like a partner, a friend, or a family. What would you tell them? Because humans cannot talk to animals and monsters, so they are allowed to eat and hunt them.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Saying something like that… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. You cannot understand. People have different common sense, culture, and ways of thinking depending on the environment in which they live. Tis impossible to reconcile demons and humans. Supposing you try to force them together, a break will always occur somewhere. Such is life.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar talks, as if he had the materials and knowledge to refute all of my words and thoughts, and ruin my shallow and naive ideas.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Therefore, child. Can you easily say something frivolous like ‘aim for a world where the demons and humans coexist’?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that it’s difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s impossible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s Tre’ainar’s conclusion, and I couldn’t overturn it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… a weak, small, ignorant kid… that’s why you’re saying I can’t change the world either…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so miserable that I lay on my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s what Tre’ainar says to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. That is why whatever you do… you must be strong, grandiose, and grow to abundant knowledge as a virtuous man. To never let anything about Aka go to waste.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I should grow more…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. Be stronger. And cross the world, with him in mind. Do not simply travel around the world, be aware of what you feel and what you want to do there. Maybe there… maybe there is some hint.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hint?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What you say now may be frivolous, however…… if you are strong, grandiose, and grow to abundant knowledge as a virtuous man, yet still say the same thing… then those words carry zeal and will undoubtedly lead to ‘something’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Something…What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『’Something’ neither Hiro nor I could reach in the end.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what I say now, it’s just groundless words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if I grow and still say the same thing, it might lead to something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s Tre’ainar’s vague words, and the future is uncertain, and there are no clear answers or goals.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I still know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m… even if I play with Aka in a dignified manner, even if we travel, to not let the people around me say anything. It might be ridiculous, but…… that’s my feeling right now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s definitely how I feel right now, and how do I manage that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to get stronger, look around the world and see a lot of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah, right.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s up to me in the future, and I’ll have to move forward anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I will~~~~ already. Eat! Let’s eat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Having made up my mind, I emptied the pot of breakfast that Mr. Aka left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was well-boiled soup in it, and when I ate it and I became a little big, I decided to eat it all vigorously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, salty juice was coming out of my eyes, but I decided to eat everything and move forward.
</div>
