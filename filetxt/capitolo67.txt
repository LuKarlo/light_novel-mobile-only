 ―― If I knew it would be this hard… I would not want to be born as a hero’s child…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the worst of parents, who have cornered their real son to the point he would say such a thing, would still give chase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s true. It’s not a lie. I love you more than anyone else in the world
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Sorry…… I couldn’t be the son of a perfect ideal hero…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… am I qualified to tell him that I love him the most in the world?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What have I seen of him until today?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t even get how he could use the 【Great Demon Spiral】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Speaking of, even though I heard from his teacher that he had mentioned the ‘Six-Gate Eye’ in class, I forgot to ask him about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why was that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lord Hiro. About the hole in the ground your son dug through, the path is blocked from the middle, and we don’t know whether or not it branched off somewhere…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. But, with his magical power, he shouldn’t have gone too far. Then, instead of his path underground, let’s search for where he’ll emerge from above the ground.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve heard about his magic health checkups. I forgot the exact numbers, but it was less than Fu or the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so, I don’t think he’s going that far… so, is that right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, it was awful, but I never expected him to be stronger than Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just the 【Great Magic Spiral】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His agility, the power of his fist, and his footwork, all left me amazed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not with a magic sword, he came to use a fighting style that I didn’t even know, my expectations were…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m really pathetic. You’re not too far with your magic? I didn’t even know my son was so strong…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His fist and footwork made sport of Rebal. That, now that I thought about it, was no petty trick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beautiful form, well-honed movement, whichever…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s not a warrior’s skill… All the power that was wielded up to the 【Great Magic Spiral】… it’s power that you got through your own efforts…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why couldn’t I look more calmly?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then we could have properly talked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lord Hiro… There are various towns and villages in the vicinity of the Imperial City, including large and smaller ones… But, to cover all of them on our own…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I rushed out of the Imperial City on my own, and was pursuing Earth in a hurry, but a few warriors came to help me out for nothing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it is still impossible to search by sorting this number of people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For now, it is supposed that the liaison team of the Imperial City will immediately contact the surrounding towns and villages, as well as border guards…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! But Earth left with only his clothes… he doesn’t have much money, either… Maybe he’s camping out. He might be hungry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, I’m thinking about where Earth might be heading.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Show me the map.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where is Earth going after running from home? Expand the map of the Imperial territory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Where could Earth go without much money?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If he were heading towards the ‘Great McCuster Forest’ or ‘Coconeal Mountain’, it’ll be a little difficult to search. It’s vast…… there is a town at the foot of the mountain.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Speaking of which, during this time of year, there are a lot of Go events in this place, so there will be a lot of people coming and going, including the people of Japone, the place will be crowded… so, Honeyborough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, it’s an area with the largest mountain and a vast forest. But I felt he wouldn’t be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He’s a clever guy, unlike me. It’ll surely be troublesome and even life threatening, so I don’t think he’d go to a place like this. And he shouldn’t have any survival experience. I doubt he’d risk going to Honeyborough or even toward that direction. He’s a weak Go player so he probably won’t want to go there.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. So think about it. About my son.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this situation, where would he go next?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… located in the other direction from Honeyborough… Inai City…… it’s definitely that time of year…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… that’s right, there’s that fighting tournament where those who take pride in their strength will gather… the prize money for the tournament is decent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it. I’m sure he’s headed there! There’s no reason to go through forests and mountains for Honeyborough, so here it is! I’m heading there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth is definitely headed here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I thought so, I was rushing out, trying to get there as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lord Hiro, wait!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, come on. For now, let’s report to the liaison team. Lord Hiro’s son may be heading to Inai city.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth. When I find him, catch him, then what can I say to him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How much should I apologize for being a hopeless father?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t be a proper parent, but what can I tell him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I still have to go-
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Lord Hiro…… It is a magic crystal communication! From the Army Commander!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah… at a time like this…… I don’t care if they slash my salary, so let’s do that later…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He wants to inform you of an urgent matter.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ur… urgent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sh*t, right when I’m in a hurry!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hiro! You…… doing as you please…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…What is it!? I’m in a rush!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hey, Hiro. When there are others around you, watch how you speak…… is what I’d like to say… Well, that’s fine. That’s for later. There’s a bad matter and a worse one.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How urgent is it that the Army Commander himself is calling?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And both matters he’s bringing up are bad?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「First of all, is the bad, but… it seems the princess, Rebal and the others fled the Imperial City leaving only written notes.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「In all probability, their purpose is to search for your son.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, hold up, huh? Right now, the Imperial City is on high alert and a strict blockade…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a hell. Why, Phianse… I mean, princess… you’re acting too hasty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m glad you’re thinking about Earth that much, but I’m in a better position to… I’m not qualified to say that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Princess, Rebal, Fu… furthermore, the young daughter of ‘the Fuefky family’ seems to be missing as well. They must have used her skills to get past security.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuefky family… Piper… ah~, that girl…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「We can’t allow the princess to roam without warrior escorts. So I asked Mamu to track down and protect the princess. I didn’t think she would be ready mentally, but she eagerly volunteered herself.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? Mamu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah! Honestly, she has a lot of other work to do, but it was an emergency, so I gave her priority. Your house maid is with her as a support.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just Sadiz!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I just thought I’d share this information. To be honest, you also have a lot of work to do… Right now, I’ll prioritize your son. Therefore, if you find the princess, have her under your protection as soon as possible.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mamu? Sadiz, too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told you to wait at home… did you take it upon yourself to search for the princess, not Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s the meaning of this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, this allows Mamu to drop a ton of work and leave the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Huh? No way… did Mamu and the princess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Well, next is a worse matter.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, huh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was suspecting Mamu’s ‘scheme’, the Army Commander’s tone got heavier when it came to the main subject.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s about the match… It seems that the demons were also monitoring. Well, we held such festivities, so we didn’t force much regulation, but…… Immediately, I received an inquiry from the Demon Realm, from that ‘Supreme Ruler La’iphant’.」 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From Lye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The technique your son used… Not only the 【Great Magic Spiral】, but also the magic control technique used just before that…… It seems to be a technique called 【Breakthrough】, a technique developed by Demon King Tre’ainar.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「I’ve been asked what it means for the son of the hero, Hiro, to use that technique.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a hell. Not only the 【Great Magic Spiral】, but also that green glowing magical power, was developed by Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… I thought it was similar, but Tre’ainar’s was a red light. So it was the same technique after all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can’t be a coincidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth has gained power related to Tre’ainar. But how?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, did someone teach Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then, who?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even though we’ve fought… I never even knew the name of that technique, but…… how many of them can use the Breakthrough?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It seems that even demons do not know much about it. It appears to have been a technique unique to The Great Demon King, and it was never passed down to anyone.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such nonsense…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「It’s just… according to La’iphant, if there was anyone that could use that technique… then there is only one possibility…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Army Commander’s tone dropped even lower.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had a bad feeling about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the name the Army Commander gave was……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「One of the ‘Former Six Supremacy and Great Demon General’ who has been missing for the past ten years, and a follower of the Great Demon King…’The Dark Valkyrie Jamdi’el’」 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No~. Oh~, Oh~. Of all people…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh, yes. Along with the strongest of the Six Supremacy ‘White Fiendish Emperor Hakuki’, one of the most dangerous figures among the Demon Army Remnants.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My head suddenly started to hurt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way… that she was in contact with Earth… that’s not possible…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「However, La’iphant doubts it. We concur, there is no reason or meaning in Jamdi’el doing such a thing… But he’s really concerned about it.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jamdi’el. One of the former Great Generals of the Demon Army, and a mighty enemy of mankind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her devotion to the Great Demon King went beyond loyalty, she practically worshiped the guy. [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s also why she was against the peace agreement after the death of the Great Demon King and disappeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had been missing for so long… could it be…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Anyway, these matters aren’t only about your family. Keep that in mind, Hiro.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I know that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「The Former Six Supremacy, Beast King La’iphant, is now in control of the Demon Realm, but if the other surviving Six Supremacy start to move with a purpose, they will be difficult to suppress, even for La’iphant.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the problem may not be just about our family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t wipe the premonition that something was about to start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth, what the hell happened to you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no matter what, I’ll catch up with you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, at that time, anything is fine. Talk to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Give me another chance to be your parent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The name here, ライファント, is phonetically ‘Raifanto’ so might be written as ‘Lyphant’. I went with La’iphant because I want to make Demons’ names more exotic when possible. Like I did with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] The name here, ヤミディレ , is phonetically ‘Yamidire’. Also I may need some input on her moniker. 暗黒戦乙女 translates as ‘Dark War Maiden’ but Mamu is already called the ‘War Maiden’. War’s Dark Damsel is what I came up with but I’m considering changing Mamu’s moniker to ‘Battle Priestess’ since she was called ‘The Priestess Mamu’ in the manga. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this. Edit: Thanks to Ark’s input, I’ll be using “The Dark Valkyrie” as Jamdi’el’s Moniker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] I’m imagining [Albedo] levels of devotion here… Watch out Earth!!!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
