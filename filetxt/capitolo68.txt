 ―― Well, if I win the tournament… Let me feel your boobs!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I never imagined things would end up this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― I see. Alright. If You Can Win Little man, then! Then let’s play with the puppies all day!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Request from Little man for the tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As an older sister, I agreed to a little obscene reward with a smile, if that would motivate Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But when I returned to my room, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Pyaaaaaaaah, t-this is so not good! What did I agree to!? B-Breasts and Little man. Th-This will earn me a fiery scolding from the Master and Madam!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was writhing with my face buried in a pillow, after diving into the bed, my feet were fluttering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Then, but no way, Lil’ Earth made such a request…… but, if it were to happen… I won’t be able to maintain my reason…… what shall we do? Somehow, I might push him down and go beyond that… No no no, that kind of education should wait at least until Little man graduates from the Academy… But I… [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I panicked because I agreed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as I continued to agonize myself, I suddenly saw Little man working hard in the garden outside the window.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Aaaah, HopScotch! HopScotch!! Hop, HopScotch!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man was doing unusual training using ladders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first glance, it seemed like he was playing, but the amount of sweat and his facial expressions conveyed determination.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps, I found a Little man who was trying to break his shell in an attempt to change something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After seeing that, I was in agony but gradually regained my composure…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Huh… Let’s buy a new bra, something risqué… [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, I couldn’t tell anyone about what had happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I couldn’t imagine it at the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Don’t! Father! Mother! Demon King killed, uncle, aunt, grandpa, grandma, everyone! Killed by the Great Demon King!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still can’t stand it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve said that to Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ruined all of Little man’s efforts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aiming for the match, Little man figured out various training regimen and persisted to face the big stage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My words ruined everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s not ruined.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I snatched them away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of Little man’s days and his place in the world up to today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By what means, I don’t know how Little Man used that technique.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, I shouldn’t have gotten so distraught… the more I think back on it, the more I can’t forgive myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lord Hiro and Lady Mamu are the benefactors of my life. Little man is their treasure, and more important to me than my life… than my life? Trivial. How trivial I am.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Their son is more important than my life, which mouth can possibly say such a thing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is a sin that makes me want to carve this body, such as losing myself to my trauma rather than my feelings for Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Actually, I want to be beheaded right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, not yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if Little man doesn’t want to, until I see him again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been a long time since I last prepared for a journey, not just a trip…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To do what I have to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Stuff everything into a huge backpack. Clothes, daily necessities, cookware, food, medical equipment sets, and weapons.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My room, which was always in order, is now a mess, but there is no time to clean up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll leave the room as it is to chase after Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was packing what I needed in my backpack, I saw a box I was keeping in the cupboard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s my treasure chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, the mere sight of the treasure-chest is enough to kill me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz! Are you ready?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excuse me, what…huh? That’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Madam, who had only made simple preparations, came to the room, looked at my hand and tilted her head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My treasure, which was kept secret from Madam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I opened the lid of the treasure chest, with much sorrow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were many small items, toy rings and other accessories stored within.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “These… were gifts that Lil’ Earth gave me for my birthday and the Academy’s entrance celebration, and so on…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he was much younger than he is now, he was a little shy as he handed me a present.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Each time, I was desperately holding back the urge to hug and kiss Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That boy, when it came to you… he was seriously in love.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How Little man thinks of me. I deflected that thought because I’m always completely charmed without meaning to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But even so, neither I nor Hiro have even considered those feelings, and believed that he and the princess should be tied together… such a heartless story, isn’t it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes. So did I.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought it would be fine if I could be by his side as a maid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, it is true that the marriage of the Princess with Little man would satisfy many people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even when I entered adolescence, instead of responding to Little man I was leading him on in an insinuating manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sadiz… obligation to the surroundings aside…… actually, if it was to be you and Earth… what would you do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I might have run away with him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… re-really.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t have the qualifications anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I answered that, Madam also held her head down with a complicated smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Really…… what was I doing, I…… I didn’t see anything. Nothing about my own child…… Nothing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not conceited, but I should be Little man’s first love.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If Little man was having such thoughts about me even when he was ‘at that age’, I might have abandoned all reason and my self-control I had so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are certain books with processed binding on the bookshelf. [The 100 Ways to Lead the Younger Man], [The Maiden’s Preparations for the First Experience without Inconvenience], really, those are mine… also… on the shelf below it…… Little man’s collection…… [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Little man… under the bed. The double bottom of the desk drawer, in the ceiling, and the Master’s study as he cannot come home lately… Hmm, did you think you could hide it? Little man. How naive!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Gah… How did you find out…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Lil’ Earth. I always have tools to see traces of someone breaking into a room, including anti-robbery measures, so, I can instantly see if anything in the room has been moved, even slightly, compared to the previous day… Even, a mountain of buried treasure such as these. What are you using your pocket money for? I mean, at Little man’s age, it’s not legal~.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― you’re wrong, no, this is… er……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Making out with older busty maids that appear in these books…… Turn a sadistic woman into a sow…… Do you want to do this, Little man? I fear the future, Yoyoyo. [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Th-That’s, d-different, fantasies that only exit in books.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Oh, is that so? That’s too bad. I’m getting more and more interested in this, and if Little man wishes…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Eh!? Really!? Oh, really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― Dream~ on ♪
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Eh…… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Huh~…… all the same, Little man is in need of a little scolding ~
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A variety of ero-books that Little man, after hitting puberty, tried to possess at every opportunity without giving up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some were about seniors, some maids, other related to sadistic women, and all suggestive of lewdness. [5]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I persistently lectured Little man, as he kneeled on his soles bearing a blushed face, and I burned all the books… well pretended to. I kept them so that when the Little man clears the ‘age’, they would be returned to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, for the harmless, inoffensive titles, the princess… [6]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… only did things that made Little man detest me…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it has always been so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I play around, tease, mislead, and today…… I did that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m really no good… I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, we are…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a bitter smile at each other, I carry my backpack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But… that routine was my happiness too…… Making fun of Little man…… so cute… But for Little man, I might simply be an annoyance… Even if Little man didn’t want it anymore…… at least…… once again, just to meet and talk… say farewell in this way…… That’s it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, now it’s more about action than depression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, Mamu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. The princess will be waiting… Even if it is…… I didn’t think the princess could come up with such a bold strategy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it was all the princess’s plan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An idea from the princess who rushed into this mansion in search of Little man who had disappeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Okaaayyy! So that was on the table this whole time……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] I demand Fan Art!! Rule 34 this right now!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Aaaannnd she was doing research! Hold up! For all her teasing him about being a virgin, doesn’t this mean she’s still one too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Considering who that ‘future’ would have involved…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S5] Hey, the guy has a type!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S6] And she still had the gall to call him out on it. Pretty sure the princess has amassed a collection as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wanna give a quick shout-out to all my Patrons for the overwhelming support. It really does mean the world to me.
