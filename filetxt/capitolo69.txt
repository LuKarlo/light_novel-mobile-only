 The injuries suffered in the fight with Aka were healed faster than I expected, Shinobu’s treatment was excellent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, on the contrary, even a light shadow spar was pretty sharp, and I was able to move quite well when I spar with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Somehow… It hasn’t been that long since the Commemorative Match… yet I feel stronger than before?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My wounds healed, had some light training sessions as we descended Coconeal Mountain, and I muttered involuntarily.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before the match, I trained hard for two months and was able to feel my growth, but within a few days after that, I felt stronger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I suppose, the experience of an actual battle might have come to light.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Trina nodded to me as if to say, ‘Of course’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You battled Aka, who could be considered among the strongest in the world, wearing away your life without hesitation. There may be no change in muscle strength or motor nerves, but your intuition may have been peeled off by a skin or two it seems.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Intuition…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And the other is confidence. By leaping forward without fear of death against such a powerful opponent, not only the senses but also mental fortitude should have been strengthened. Moreover, the fight with the Shinobi woman would have been a good experience.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m honestly not sure myself, but it might be the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Against the caliber of strength like Mr. Aka’s, I planted my feet and we exchanged blows.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kept receiving that powerful fist with my forehead without blinking.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, incidentally, Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know that the improvement of my senses and spirit could make such a difference.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow…… I now feel like I can endure any kind of training and become stronger.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a good trend. Even if you lack a clear goal as in the previous match, tis something you ‘want to do’ yourself.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m now thinking, ‘I want to be strong for now’, and I don’t have a clear and familiar goal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, I’m happy to see myself getting stronger and I’ve come to want to train myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if you lack a familiar goal… there is no loss in obtaining them, such as ‘strength’, ‘unrivaled special skills’, and ‘money’. Even if there is no need right now, they never hurts to possess.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yeah… Money. Well, certainly I was anxious when I didn’t have any.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if it is not necessary, there is no loss. That’s true.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now what I want the most ‘strength’, and I’m getting better.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to get a lot while I can get it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar. It’ll be troublesome, but can’t we have some more training in the mountains? Here, I can do intensive training for Parkour, and speaking of training, it’ll be like mountain seclusion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike before, breasts aren’t being dangled like carrots in front of me, I myself have come to change something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Meeting Mr. Aka, fighting, making up and parting ways. Maybe that has changed me a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, incidentally, Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I got so motivated, Tre’ainar……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, once you are feeling well enough, we shall first descend the mountain. Training is done on level ground.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, what? Why not? We’re in the mountains, right? You know, the mountain air is thin, so if I train here and fight in the lower world, it’s like I’ll get even stronger, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He just threw a wet blanket at my motivation, or rather, if it was the previous Tre’ainar, he would have had me train even during sleep, so why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the contrary. Because the air is thin, we cannot perform the same, much less, better high-quality training you had so far. Should that happen, it will inevitably be necessary to lower the training load. High-altitude training can certainly enhance your cardiopulmonary function, but you still need quality training on level ground.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I-Is that how it is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh. Ideally, the body would adapt by sleeping in areas with thinner atmosphere, and then training is performed on a plain field. Tis called ‘Magical Living High Training Row’, but it still requires more than a few weeks for the body to adapt.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It appeared again, Tre’ainar’s theory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you have already acquired technique and power, and are aiming for a higher level, that training is effective, but you can still grow as much as you want with but a single skill and knowledge. As such, training on level ground, and increasing knowledge while crossing the world on level ground… that should suffice for now.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As expected, it is Tre’ainar. It’s not that he has become kind, but because he had a proper reason for his judgment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then… as it is, we’ll descend the mountain.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wandered into the forest from Imperial City, met Mr. Aka, reached the town of Honeyborough, and returned to Aka’s house to fight. Also, I fought with Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took a few days’ rest, and am now climbing the mountain and descending to the other side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even without a clear goal, my steps were light.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now…… as it concerns, the destination after descending the mountain…… where shall we go?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. If I’m just moving over Coconeal Mountain, starting from Honeyborough, if my memory is correct… the town where merchants gather……’Cantidan’…… that’s where.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t completely remember the geography outside of the Imperial City, so it’s vague.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah, if that is so, I have heard of it. There is a famous market street with hundreds of thousands of merchants opening street stalls. While there were fraudulent crimes of selling counterfeit goods under the guise of legendary treasure, tis a town that could not be crushed due to its economic efficacy.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you knew that, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, one way or another, that town has a fascinating history. I have come to hear of it by chance in rumors.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fascinating history? What? Is that right? Why have I never heard of that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve only heard rumors about a town where you can get your hands on many cheap and affordable items.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is it not just right? Also, you are unable to become a hunter. Recently we acquired funds by playing a game of Go, let us search for a bargain in the town.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, bargains… I don’t have the eye for such judgment…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is discovering such bargains so easy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of me as I thought so, Tre’ainar gave off an awe-inspiring aura, as he seemed to want to throw a retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, Tre’ainar… incidentally, you…… that sort of …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The eyes of this Great Demon King shall determine all authenticity.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah~, yeah, yeah, amazing, amazing. Somehow, no matter how great this guy gradually gets, I’m no longer surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis not that we such dedicated magic is non-existent, but tis also a good experience to cultivate the ability to distinguish authenticity. If all goes well, you will gain a fortune, will you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, uh… for the time being, I just want to get stronger, so I’m not particularly looking to be an appraiser…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as there is no way I can continue my journey without going through the town, I end up stopping by after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
