 “Anyway, let’s get this over with!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A collection of problems made by Sadiz given to me as punishment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I felt depressed, I had no choice but to sit at my desk and get started.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… You commenced without delay.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Because Sadiz would get angry… if hated, I… would be troubled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t just keep silent. It’s embarrassing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, yes, well… Tis the first time seeing such tone and demeanor.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King stares at me as if impressed that I was obedient towards Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After exchanging a few words with him, I immediately concentrated on the magic mathematics problem. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Let’s see…… divide this section.…… substitute it here…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sadiz’s original problems are a little more difficult than what appears in the Academy class.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Careless mistakes are really fatal because of the tedious formulas.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s worse, Sadiz will never give a ‘partial point’ for using the right process even though the solution is wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Since only correct or incorrect answers are judged, it takes time to verify.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… Is it a matter of formulas?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ssh, I’m trying to focus, so don’t talk to me right now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King seems to be bored and looked into the problems that I solved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, while looking at my answer, the Great Demon King……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm…… Your fundamental academic ability seems to be superior to your father’s.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha-!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I trembled with such shock that I broke the pen I was holding.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Well… What? Oh, than father… superior?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Is something wrong? No matter how you look at it, is he not a single-minded fool without any decent academic achievement? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the first time I was told that I was better than my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is true that during his Academy years my father was not good at listening to the classroom lectures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I had never been told that I was ‘superior’ to my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The only thing that was said to me was a subtle compliment that “You are more on point than your father”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I was puzzled by the words “better than your father.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well…… despite your competence at solving such formulas, it would be of no use in the real world or in magical research.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if used, tis merely a way to demonstrate academic ability… In other words, merely for the sake of examination.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone once thinks, “What’s the point of remembering this?” at one time or another. The answer to the question, by the Great Demon King himself, saying, “It useless” just cut me down!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? Suddenly hanging your head and your hands are still?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whose fault is that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why am I even doing this? I suddenly felt like an idiot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the self-proclaimed Omnipotent One has declared “it is useless”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even so, you humans are inefficient. Why put such efforts to calculations that have no application in your lifetime? Is the answer that important?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, while sighing to me as my hand stopped, the Demon King said that our way was “inefficient”, besides being meaningless in the first place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Inefficient?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. Rather than going through each and every detail of the calculation, tis more efficient to【Auto-Calculate】the result once you keep the equation in mind.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t understand what the Great Demon King was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, automatic calculation? What’s that? “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Aah, that is………come to think of it… You humans are incapable of that…… no helping it then.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King whispers as he immediately realized my doubts. After a few seconds of silence, the Demon King made me a suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Very well. If you cannot go outside unless you are done… I shall offer a little of my cooperation.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cooperation? What? Are you saying you’ll solve it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I am not. Now follow my instructions… draw a Contractual Magic Circle for Magic Acquisition』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Magic Circle?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does he intend to have me perform a ritual to learn a certain magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The level of power and accuracy of magic increases through training, but one cannot learn any beginner magic unless a contract is invoked by magic circle. Speaking of, have you ever drawn your own magic circle? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That is the routine. Don’t you learn the basic magic attributes, wind, lightning, and terran by contracting yourself? The only way to grow is by doing the work yourself. Sadiz is…” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… In that case, it should suffice. Good…… Draw a six-pointed star on the floor, and cast the spell I chant while crafting magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Seriously…… So what’s going to happen?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You shall be more efficient!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was instructed to make a magic contract while studying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you want to finish early and go outside, if you have time to do this, you should solve one more problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Demon King still suggests that it is more efficient.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow I was interested in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The chant is ‘Ẅeṋḋoẁ ẕuṁa ai ḱuṟoṧo ẝuṭo ẝeiṧu [ḃeṋṟii] [S3] ’…… now, chant it!』 [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, it was a chant that I had never heard before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, this is the Demon King’s original……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha-… What kind of magic is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If this was an original of the Great Demon King, I was a little excited like a kid with a new toy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It didn’t matter if he was the nemesis of mankind, because I may be able to use the magic of the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, that magic is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Automatic calculation magic, 【Exail】』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Excel…are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never heard of it. What kind of magic is it? Well, that’s fine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…Well, alright. Whether may happen…… Contract with me, ‘Ẅeṋḋoẁ ẕuṁa ai ḱuṟoṧo ẝuṭo ẝeiṧu ḃeṋṟii’…… The name of the power I seek is ………… 【Exail】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I thought of it, it’s been a while since I signed a new spell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A unique pale light overflows, the magic circle on the floor erodes into my body, envelops it, and feels like I’m wearing something new.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… With this…… Is this okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis enough.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The magic circle on the floor disappeared cleanly, too. This is also proof of learning a new magic, and it went well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So…? What should I do now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cast 【Exail】, imagine an equation in your mind and assign the figures. The chant is the same ancient magic words as before.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, understood… ‘Ẅeṋḋoẁ ẕuṁa ai ḱuṟoṧo ẝuṭo ẝeiṧu ḃeṋṟii’”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chanted. Now, what’s going to happen?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a little, no, more and more a sensation like my head clearing up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is, similar to the feeling you get when you use your head for calculation, memorization, etc. and it is going well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this situation, I envisioned the equation in my head and substitute the numbers……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… 4545072…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I applied a number to the equation envisioned in my head, the solution came to mind in an instant… no way!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Automatically calculated… That is the answer.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What…?!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whaaaat!? A, absurd, s, such a long calculation……… me, j, just now, in an instant?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. All the calculations and functions divided into fine denominators and numerators in the equation, envision even the formula mentally, the rest will automatically derive the answer.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis what I’ve developed… 【Exail】』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You idiot! All the same, this sort of instant, complex calculation… such a thing……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wai, wait a minute! Now, after undoing the magic, l, let’s confirm it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Verify as often as you like.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unbelievably, for it to go this far. If, if this were possible… Everything in the field of magic mathematics…… Even the purpose of the exam… Seriously?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… Answer…… 4545072…… It’s the same.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do you understand? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “T, this time with another problem! mumble mumble…… 【Exail】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With this, performing long-running calculations, being wary of careless mistakes, do you even need to check again and again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hey hey, such a thing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… 69…… Oh, well, seriously…… Ha ha…… Hey, hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『How do you find it? Efficient, is it not? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha! Haha! Hahahahahaha! It’s great!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was delighted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never thought I could learn such a convenient magic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is useful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, as long you know the equation, the rest is easy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at least in magic mathematics alone the princess…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I hadn’t realized yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Magic mathematics wasn’t the only magic and knowledge possessed by the Great Demon King, rather this was just the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] I was thinking of using [Arithmancy] , which is an actual field of divination in ancient Greece. But opted to keep Magic Mathematics even if it’s a mouthful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Okay! This might be a conundrum. Earth attribute is probably what is intended here but that is also the MCs name. One translation suggested Soil but I don’t know if that will work. What if they throw huge rocks around, that no soil I’ve ever seen. Any alternative suggestions? Edit! I’ve decided to use Terra in the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] This took awhile. With the find and replace tool. Just copied what was written phonetically and dressed it up to look arcane.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
