<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m going over the mountain after Tre’ainar’s suggestion that secluded mountain training isn’t so effective for me right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it does not mean that we will reach the base immediately, so it will take some time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, it was quite difficult for me to cross the mountain, because, in the first place, I hadn’t prepared for a trip at all in the town of Honeyborough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t have any water or food prepared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m getting a little hungry… I wish I had returned to town once from Mr. Aka’s house.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Good Grief. Have you forgotten the first night? At such times, one should benefit from the bountiful natural blessings of mountains.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, this red fruit… it looks kind of sweet…… can I eat it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cease. Tis poisonous. A staple among mountain fruits that should not be consumed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar sighs at my remark as I sat down to take a breather on the way down the mountain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, what would have happened if I hadn’t met Mr. Aka on the first night?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t like the idea of catching and eating snakes and frogs. The rabbit I caught also escaped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t eat mushrooms after all, so I haven’t had any survival experience yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis only when you experience such poisons that you acquire resistance, but I will not ask that of you right now. Now, tis important to eat and grow with a nutritional and balanced diet. If you are to consider your diet during the growth period, tis best to reside on level ground.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Diet. The first thing that came to mind when he said that is the meals I’ve been eating since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Most of them were made by the same person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Diet… It’s only been a few days… but not eating Sadiz’s meal…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I felt like I hadn’t eaten it much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I ate it as a matter of course every day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar was so impressed after seeing Sadiz’s menu that had me in mind and was made just for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was always by my side and took good care of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I wanted to repay Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted to show Sadiz something cool.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was always an employer or a young master, I wanted her to see me as a man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it was no good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, it hurt Sadiz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I thought back on it, I felt helpless again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… uhn?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, while I was thinking of Sadiz and pensive, Tre’ainar seemed to have noticed something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child. A little further from here…… along the path…… is there something?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Something? What something? Snake? Frog? Rabbit? No way, it can’t be an Ogre, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Is it a beast?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, nothing like that, and there is no danger, but… that is…… uhn? Uhn~…… what could it be? ‘that fellow’……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not sure what he’s talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar noticed something, and his face gradually became shocked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, he was holding his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…What, what is it? The heck……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I anxiously stood up and made my way as it was, to see if there was no danger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the trees came out in a slightly open area, and something was dropped there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What the hell is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was something wrapped in a bag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Furthermore, beside it is a cylindrical object.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And besides that……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Writing utensils?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even writing instruments were dropped…… No, was it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, there’s a piece of paper attached to it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A note? …’Please feel free to eat’ …what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not that it was dropped. Please eat? Hey, you’ve suddenly become suspicious, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some kind of trap? But for now, let’s see what’s inside……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-what the hell is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I opened the bag, there were about three objects made of rolled up, hardened white rice about the size of a fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, what seemed to be yellow and square food cut into bite-sized portions together with the rice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis… rice balls and fried egg.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Raisubou? Fried egg?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh huh…… as a portable meal or bento, tis a staple dish in Japone.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Japone’s cooking? Why was it dropped in a place like this, and besides, ‘feel free to eat’? So, does that mean I can eat this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It does not seem to contain any poison… eating would be no problem, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no, but…a-are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I don’t know why this was dropped, and it’s too suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, from the moment I saw this rice ball or whatever, I was so tempted to eat it I couldn’t help drooling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? But what about forks and knives? No way, with bare hands?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In Japone, rice balls are eaten with bare hands.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t you get angry because eating with your bare hands is bad manners?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… such a spoiled twit.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is eating something with your bare hands allowed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though Sadiz gets very angry about how I use a fork and knife, with your bare hands?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? Is Japone like a primitive or undeveloped nation?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there’s nothing to poke at it with… so that’s how, I took a hearty bite on this rice ball.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bit on it…… and I…… I wonder what…… it seeped throughout my body… the taste of each grain of rice is awesome!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, is there something in the rice ball?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the white rice, there’s something white…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~…… seafood, seasoned with a certain sauce… I see…… Tuna mayo…… tis what you mean, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “De, delicious…… so good, what is this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps. By my knowledge while I was alive, tis not a leap for this to win first place in the Japone Rice Ball Rankings.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously! Tuna mayo is the best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what. It felt like my tired body was reviving.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t believe you can eat rice like this… This egg…… What?! It’s sweet! But it’s great!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It must contain sugar. Japone’s fried egg is different as the eastern culture uses sugar whereas the western culture uses a little salty with soup stock.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, somehow, I feel calm after eating this gutsy white rice, I quite like it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so? As for me, I do not care for sweet fried egg as a meal.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the first time I’ve eaten it. It was a dish that I had never eaten before, even though it was an ingredient I could get in the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s simple, yet I’ve come to think it’s great.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tuna mayo rice balls and sweet fried egg.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, water too! The water is moderately chilled and seeps through my worn-out body! It’s so good!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first I was suspicious, but before I realized it, I had eaten three rice balls and an egg dish in a few seconds.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t full, but it was more than enough to energize the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a recovery that I didn’t expect to achieve today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surely… this… from Japone.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although I was satisfied, I calmed down a bit, looked at the empty package and suddenly thought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… as expected, was it her?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『All of a sudden, appeared then absconded, left that in place and disappeared.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, there’s something up with that girl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Why? Didn’t she go home with her brothers?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Who knows. At least there are no other ninjas around…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So she’s on her own? What is your intention? For me? Simple good intentions?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Oi, child. The note she left earlier…… there is still something written on the back, is there not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? On the back?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do not hesitate to eat, is there something written on the back?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was told, I turned the paper over…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ―― have you replied in the exchange diary yet, I wonder? But I know. I’m sure you couldn’t because you didn’t have any writing tools, right? So, I’ll leave this for you, so use it. I’ll be waiting in anticipation for your reply for as long as it’ll take for me to receive it. I’ll keep on, waiting. On and on, waiting for you ♡
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, somehow the ambience of the writing felt a little sloppy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I felt a tremendous chill for a moment, I realized that I had completely forgotten about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, and…… either way, this…… writing? Ah, that’s what the writing instrument is for…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could have thrown it away in front of Mr. Aka’s house, but after all, it was an exchange diary that I held on to somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh…… While estranged from your real life, it seems you are being cornered by a troublesome woman, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh…… e-even if you say that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar with a somewhat chilly smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I’ve never been able to direct my thoughts like this before, and while I don’t feel bad about it, I am a little scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And most of all, I don’t know how to deal with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child. For those who are straightforward and heavily infatuated, should you take a half-hearted and suggestive attitude…… there is a risk that matters will later become irreparable. No matter what your answer, be sincere.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And finally, my master is in a situation where he even talks about my love affair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And when you give your answer, be sure to know the person you are talking to. Earlier, the things I mention would not trouble you if you had them… power, money, and so on, but there was still something crucial to consider. Tis ‘an eye for people’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “An, eye?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. No matter who you are, you do not have to be admired from all sides. Even if you do not have a million subordinates, be sure to identify those you can trust from the bottom of your heart, and keep them by your side. Whether a loved one or a peerless comrade… they will be the pillar of your life.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Develop the ability to judge people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I talked of authenticity a while ago. Tis not only for items. Cultivate an eye for people. In the world, that Ogre…… not all of them are like Aka. A child of your upbringing will easily be deceived, so be careful.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I think about it, I certainly wanted Sadiz and my parents to recognize me, but I wanted to look back at all the people who saw me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar says.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if I’m not recognized by a million people, if there is only one person who can be trusted… If I can identify them…… huh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…… I trust you deeply… It seems, in that sense, I have you now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh my, so…… tis… now… huh? …… fue~.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, even if you’re the Great Demon King, Tre’ainar now respects, trusts and leads me…huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…huh… ah, aaah… t-tis nothing…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Tre’ainar is acting a little strange…… that? Unconsciously, what did I just say?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, naturally…… That?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『……………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ach, I said something really embarrassing just now, didn’t I!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A somewhat cringy thing to do, and I spontaneously…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, no, no, no, ah, erm, just now, uh huh, goodness, ahahahahahaha! Let’s see, what was it again?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Eh? Wh-What was it? Right now, were you speaking? Fuhahaha, apologies. Since my passing I occasionally get a little hard of hearing.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yeah! No, I didn’t say anything, so never mind!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, tis so! Well, then this conversation has come to an end! Well, tis a fine day today! On such a day, we should perform some gymnastics under the sky!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It became awkward, and incoherent so we mutually backed away from the subject.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『”Ahahahahahaha…… ha ha… “』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, yes, I can’t be helped because Tre’ainar was a deaf demon king. Yeah.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because he says he can’t hear me, so I can’t hear him, yes!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So let’s get back on track.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, erm, what were you talking about? Oh yes, being heavily infatuated, this and that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Um, surely it was!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. But, the way you talked just now, like it’s from an extremely personal experience? By any chance, in the past, were you deeply in lov-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Now, child! After an intake of carbohydrates, tis better to exercise moderately than to remain idle! So, I shall instruct you on the proper gymnastics!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… huh? I was only half joking, but Tre’ainar suddenly changed the subject as if he got flustered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah? It might be the first time I’ve seen my master like this, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Tre’ainar…… for certain you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Great Demon Gymnastics No.1! First of all, begin with a large stretching exercise!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surely… Tre’ainar’s past love? …… terrific, I wanna hear!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoping exercise of both feet! One, two, three, close, open, close, open!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, to me, frantic deception notwithstanding, while performing strange gymnastics by skillfully leaping and spreading both hands and feet at a rhythm, Tre’ainar burst into laughter, and ultimately the topic came to naught, darn it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, well, it’s something he suggested, so I’ll write my reply to the exchange diary… within the range that can be answered……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Good evening. Because it is hot, I am completely naked and have no problems.
</div>

 I’m posting my information on Twitter while I’m traveling, but it’s not interesting, so you don’t have to look at it.

 Well, the update was finally interrupted, and there might have been a lot of people who were abandoned, but I still wanted to respond somehow to the person who saw it, and stuck for about two hours in Starbucks. To be honest, the notebook PC I brought takes quite a while to boot up, and I struggled quite a bit because the speed was unusually slow, but I can update with it somehow. I’m still sick every day until I return from my trip, but I’d like to keep updating, so I’m looking forward to working with you, thank you.
