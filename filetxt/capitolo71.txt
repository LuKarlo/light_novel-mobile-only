</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, my hand gradually stopped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, when I looked at each question, they started out bland but got more and more embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This, I guess I can’t just suddenly answer this! Or rather, don’t ask a man his favorite underwear color!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… noticed it sooner…… also, the loincloth is underwear peculiar to Japone, tis wrapped like a belt around the waist and crotch… and, more importantly, you went shopping with a woman in town, did you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s about it! Well, with Sadiz…… I tagged along while shopping for dinner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… I wonder if it counts…… Also? Did you not simply do the shopping?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s… that…… I got candy from a street stall…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, wait. How old were you at the time?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, Tre’ainar had a dumbfounded look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn, even I could have gone on at least one date if it was true… but since I joined the Academy, Sadiz’s malicious streak increased, and at the Academy, she got in the way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Incidentally, not just the maid, what about at the Academy?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Due to one thing after another… nothing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so? For example, after lectures…… to walk home from school with a girl.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t! At the Academy, I had to deal with the princess’s whims and accompany her, and all around my classmates would giggle…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ho……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, there’s a reason I spent so lonely a youth that Tre’ainar was amazed with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s all due to the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was awful, okay? A few years ago, I was popular with the academy girls who make sweets and have boys eat them, and the princess got on it. But the princess is actually a terrible cook, but because she was practicing, she kept forcing me to eat really bad stuff as an experiment, and before I knew it, I was too occupied being her test subject, so the girls were giving other boys sweets to eat… After that, boys’ and girls’ groups seemed to get along, I tried to join in but I was the only one out of the loop… That’s not all! One day, she said that there was no carriage to pick her up after school, and even though the palace was in the opposite direction from our mansion, I was forced to escort her to the palace… Oh yes, there was dust on the princess’s shoulder, and the moment I reached out to brush it off, the princess raised a weird voice, got angry with her face red and hit me, getting me laughed at by the girls in my class… when I beat a boy in the class, Gellipy, in a mock battle, the girls were giggling for a moment, she had the nerve to give a thorough, long winded explanation to the girls and my reputation fell… No, I was in kindergarten before entering the Academy… what?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as I was ranting my grudge against the princess, Tre’ainar gradually passed amazement, and began to show a little irritation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s wrong, Tre’ainar…… that face……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You… so not only the eyes to judge people… it seems you need to study on people’s feelings as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? You realize the misfortune I’ve had because of the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I got into my senior year, there were couples in my class who were going out, some guys have gone on dates, and occasionally spent long vacations… that…… those guys get to graduate…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Goodness me, not only the eye for people, but also the ability to understand people’s hearts… a moment ago, I was slightly pleased to hear that you trust me from the bottom of your heart…… you said you trusted me, but I see no value in being told so by someone so dull-headed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s too much!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, you should learn not only the authenticity of what is visible, but also the subtleties of human emotions. Or rather, tis essential for people to live in reality. Anyone who does not understand the feelings of others, even if you trust them, they will not open their heart to you, and no one will be able to put their faith in you. Tis no exaggeration to say that Aka was simply an exception.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I was told by the Demon King, who once tried to destroy the human race, to understand human feelings more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Weird. I’m not that dull. [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, when I was trying to peep at the Holy land under Sadiz’s skirt as she was ascending and descending the stairs, I tried to discern Sadiz’s expression, gaze, and every move. …… Well, the contents I peeped at were shorts instead of panties, and even the shorts read [You Missed ♡], I had an indescribable feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Listen in earnest. Were you to understand people’s hearts a little more…… perhaps Aka wouldn’t have left silently.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You do not need to completely read the depths of people’s hearts, but if you considered it with a little more interest… you may have understood.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I was told that, my heart clenched.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… it seems…… I’m…… yeah…… I…… was dumb…… I still… really was…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. Otherwise, even if you are fortunate to find people the likes of Aka and the Shinobi girl, who feel great affection for you, unless you notice, there will be no one beside you, will there not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That night, when Mr. Aka said, ‘Let’s talk slowly tomorrow’, if I could better read his true intentions… I may not have let Mr. Aka leave on his own…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A person’s heart is not so easy to understand by simply getting along with them. To have done inexcusable things… to hurt someone with a casual word… to violently bumped into each other…… and…… to commit an irreparable act to a person… unless you do such, you might never understand.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bumping into each other… Irreparable…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everything he said, it sunk into the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt like I somehow got that there were things that I would not understand unless I bumped into them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In that respect, the next city to visit… Cantidan may be suitable for you. Those who try to deceive others…… those who are honest and tell the truth…… tis full of many things. Simply by walking around the town, you will be spoken to by a variety of merchants.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That sounds…… scary…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I believe tis also an experience. No matter how hard the fight or battle may be, the world cannot easily be crossed. You should learn to appreciate that in your own way.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt Tre’ainar had a point, so I nodded in agreement… that said, it’s the reality, I have to see people better, then understand their hearts and accept them. Well, not only Mr. Aka, but also Tre’ainar is an exception……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, I’ve answered the exchange diary, as much as I can for now… Let’s see. I suppose I’ll leave it here. And… 「Rice balls and fried egg, it was so delicious, thank you」… And that’s good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I keep only the exchange diary and the letter and put them where the rice ball was dropped.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… in which case, let’s go straight to Cantidan.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a few hours later, I finally arrived at the foot of the mountain and set foot in the town of Cantidan. Immediately……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve updated it, but…… Actually, I’m not in Japan yet. It’s just that I’m alive. I’m doing it energetically and happily. I didn’t wear any clothes, so my whole body turned black.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] So, MC can rant too. I’m still waiting to have all this thrown at her face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Pfft!!
