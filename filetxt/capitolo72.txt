 It took a while, but I finally reached the foot of the mountain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s within Imperial territory, but the town spread out in my field of view is a new land that I’ve never been to before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the commercial town, Cantidan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are no tall buildings like the Imperial City, but there are tents on the left and right of the city streets, many stalls with sheets spread out on the floor and products lined up, and many people flocked into the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, come on! Today’s goods are here! Here I have a [Hermes Bag] as worn by the upper class ladies of the Imperial City! This bag, which usually goes for a million Madka, is a super bargain cause I got it straight from the maker! How about half price at 500,000 Madka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dad Dad, it’s a real Teelex pocket watch! A real one!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s the price? Stop playing! You can’t fool my eyes, can you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you. Why don’t you just listen to me? I have a good deal, but I’ll only tell you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When does the slave auction start?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This here comes from a certain leaf… If you light it up and smoke it, it’ll guide you to the world of fascination, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The liveliness is different from that of Honeyborough, where they had a Go tournament.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both sellers and buyers are serious and have a unique enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the street, there aren’t many housewives with children out to buy dinner, as in the Imperial City, or young students like me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was still crowded with a lot of people, and the city was overflowing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In-Incredible… It’s even more crowded than the commercial district of the Imperial Capital…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh~… too much, do not look so restless, will you? An unaccustomed young man like you comes across as easy prey, do you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, that’s right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From here on out, I had to be careful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I know. However, if you are wary from the beginning, you’ll be deceived. I’ll feed my eyes and look at a lot of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course. And if possible, tis better to raise as much military funds as possible. Even lacking an ID card, there are numerous ways to traverse the world so long as you have money.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What Tre’ainar told me before I got here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Authenticity. To develop the ability to identify not only things but also people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And to prepare for future trips, I would like to secure some money if possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that in mind, I finally stepped foot into “Cantidan”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You there, young man! Will you listen to me for a moment?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I was spoken to right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old man was standing at the entrance of the city. He was neatly dressed, yet he was trying to talk to a stranger? It’s suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m sorry to call out all of a sudden. I’m thinking of opening a new store in this town, Mansion Gates. But it’s kind of hard to open a shop by yourself… I’d like to borrow a young man’s hand, but if you’re interested, could you help me? I’ll pay you well, and if the store thrives, I’ll pay even more, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see. Hinting at money to a young man… It’s too suspicious. In general, I do not think that a shop opened by an old man on his own will prosper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No thanks, I think you’ll have to find someone else.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yes, that’s right… That’s too bad…… it’ll definitely thrive, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old man became gloomy when I refused. He doesn’t seem to be trying to pester me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, you could at least ask what sort of products they handle, could you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…? Is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah. I told you to identify people, but…… I never said you should make a quick decision.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I turned down the old man, Trainer whispered advice in my ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But as soon as Tre’ainar told me not to be fooled, all the people in this town looked suspicious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey there, friend! Are you short of money? I’m Mago! Mago Masgy. If you’re troubled, why not help me out?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait a minute! Sir, aren’t you interested in apples? Why don’t we change the world together with my apples? Name’s Steve Works.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you interested in our products? I’ll make it cheaper now, right? We, the Lamp brothers made a tool that can fly through the sky without using magic-“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve only walked a few steps into the city, but I’ve been called at by various people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s this talk about helping with your work, asking to buy your products, or flying through the sky without magic?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I don’t know how to put it… it’s lively, but it’s a shady town…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Is that so? It seems to have people with very passionate eyes in the mix as well…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was getting tired and sighing… It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kyaa”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Someone bumped into me from behind… a soft elasticity hit me……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m sorry…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no…… eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two watermelons!? Skirt Short!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I beg your pardon, sir. This Sis was just walking around in a daze with this vase and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N-No, it’s, no, thing…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ridiculous. What is this overwhelmingly short dress!? What’s with the chest that’s likely to explode!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had bright red lipstick, and a sexy mole near the mouth, and she’s so beautiful and her killer body bumping into me, holding her hips and I can see…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, this vase… ‘Sis’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regrettable, regrettable. Before she notices my gaze…… somewhat, it’s a completely ordinary vase.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, you had to pick it up for me… well, I wonder if big sis could treat you to a cup of coffee to apologize?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, no, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come now, kids shouldn’t be so modest… have a chat with big sister for a little while, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My arm is snugly within the valley…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s your name?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, is Earth… it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. I’m Date. I’m called Date Shoho. Nice to meet you ♪”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is suspicious!? Yes, it’s suspicious! I have to listen to a lot of things, right? I mean, if I don’t take a better look……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ta-Talk about to me… no, ah~, um, is elder sister in town for shopping?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m here to sell. This vase.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She was trying to sell the vase, but her expression suddenly turned desperate…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is…… a lucky vase… a vase that brings good luck to those who have it, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Re, really…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just, because of some circumstances, and I’m selling this… to get medicine for my sick dad…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wh-What? As I thought of her flashy outfit, what’s with the dire situation?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If it could sell for tens of thousands… but it didn’t work out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the older sister who puts out her tongue with a little tear in her eyes… What a pity!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I currently have around 80,000…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The vase is rubbish…… its value is dirt cheap at best…… to begin with, if it truly brought good fortune, her father would be safe, and her luck would enable a sale from the onset, would it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar made a cold-blooded and outrageous remark. Tre’ainar…… have you no heart! No, he’s the Great Demon King!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, do not be fooled. The people of this town are very discerning. Tis why they do not go to street vendors or pawn shops, but to an amateur such as yourself…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Uh… sure… But… But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Mr. Earth…… you know…… I’d like to… if you help a sister out…… as a thank you…… right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, damn, this elder sister glanced at me… Somehow, even more of the chest is exposed…… no, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, if you don’t mind, about 50,000…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you very much! Earth, this kind sis just remembered an errand, so I’m going home bye-bye.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because all her assets were tight against me, the moment I brought out as much money as I could manage, the elder sister smiled quickly took the money from my hand and ran from there, flinging the good luck vase as she ran away. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “She, she’s gone… wi, with just thanks? Wasn’t she going to do something for me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh…… We-well, considering this helped save someone too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s not like I was asking for something in return.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, the money I had was like small change anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I, who had the money, could help someone suffering from an illness…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey…… That young guy was done in right away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. Date’s guy, he had just come to town, a virgin-smelling kid who seemed unfamiliar with women was deceived again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How many suckers that become Date’s victims does this make?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… To help others…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi…… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ma…… Master…… Oh, I… I was on my guard, but…… That money…… Master…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hah~…… Do not look so pathetic…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I…… I’m gonna catch that bitch!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was told to be careful.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, that was money that Tre’ainar got, but I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hah~…… for the time being, we could chase that woman down right away and retrieve the funds… or otherwise hunt a bargain… No, unless there is some business with her you would like to attend to.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? What does that mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than getting angry, Tre’ainar, who seemed astounded, suggested something to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, there’s trouble! Someone assaulted Date on the other side of the street!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, she’s stuck in a net, like some kind of trap?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, a young girl suddenly showed up… a pretty sexy girl, no boobs though, right!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, why are you attacking us? That tiny~ yubuhheagu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell? Uoaaaah, so, so merciless. Why are you doing this? And that woman…… Hey, Date can’t move at all and you’re actually stripping her bare!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That girl, chattering!? Huh? What are you saying? Big-breasted monsters must perish? They deserve certain death for deceiving honey?” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There seemed to be some fuss across the street at the time, but I was oblivious to it as I listened to Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] SMH!! I’m literally Shaking My Head at this point…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Wonder what that’s about! Ah! Probably nothing important…
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
