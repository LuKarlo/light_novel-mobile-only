 Cantidan. There is a mixture of genuine and counterfeit items, so judging super expensive and dirt cheap items depends on both seller and the buyer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The clash between the buying side looking to cut the price by even a single coin and the selling side determined to not lose even a single coin was unfolding here and there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hou~…… Is that a journal written by The Great Demon King, Tre’ainar?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes! It was found on the scene when the Allied forces took control of the Demon King’s Zettsmaite territory, these were orders that Great Demon King Tre’ainar sent to the unit commander who was in charge of the territory.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Never have I sent such a missive. In general, I do not leave handwritten documents. All orders were relayed by the magic crystal, and I only issued instructions to those of the 6 Supremacy class directly. Tis almost impossible to send them to a Commanding Officer class.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Among the many things that the All-Knowing, All-Powerful Tre’ainar boasts of knowing the most, it’s fakes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is the Wand of Brilliance held by the king of the ruined Kingdom of Monay two centuries ago. Its historical value, is preposterous, as of now however…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a fake with simple glasswork embedded within. In the first place, the king of that country had a Sun Staff…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is Kotetsu, the sword wielded by the legendary swordsman Konduo, who was once the pride of Japone!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The actual article was once broken by me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, from what I’ve been hearing from Tre’ainar so far……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… are there only fakes here?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, tis how things are. Cantidan is also known as A Thousand and Three.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aha! So if there are a thousand pieces, only three are real?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, you might say three is too generous. Tis likely less.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I’ll make a fortune… was what I thought, but the reality doesn’t seem so generous.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, if there is no genuine article, there is neither profit nor sh*t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But…… tis actually my first time here, then again…… I believed there was a little more of a ‘behind the scenes’ feel to things, but it does not seem so.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, from Tre’ainar’s muttering, I wondered if he had a slightly different impression of this town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Behind the scenes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Speaking of the shadows, tis the shadows. Surely I have mentioned such? While this city is rife with fraudulent crimes of selling counterfeit goods under the guise of legendary treasure, it could not be crushed due to its economic benefits.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But there was a great pretext that kept it from being crushed. Tis the existence of the ‘Underworld’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Underworld?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Uh hun. In such places, items prohibited by law are also traded behind the scenes. In addition to selling counterfeits that are different from the actual price. However, such dealings naturally cause trouble. In order to solve such problems, there is an Underworld organization.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ah…… like a bouncer.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. They are compensated by the shops and merchants they place under their protection… At times they act as intermediaries, and oversee dealings behind the scenes with high-ranking officials from all over the world and sometimes they traded secretly with the demons.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I watched Tre’ainar talking with a somewhat “Nostalgic” feel, it somehow struck me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, maybe the Demon King’s Army…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh. I was not involved directly, but…… the organization that had been in this town for decades had some involvement with the Demon King’s Army.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…… During the war, humans made deals with the Demon King’s Army…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Come now, the world is full of many diverse humans, or so I heard. Those who do not care for law or order… known as ‘the Mafia’ existed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mafia. I heard that name…eh? That reminded me of something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? No, I remembered it in the Mafia…… certainly, a few years ago, my father took the initiative on the ‘Mafia Expulsion Initiative’, and so the minister who was connected with the big organization was disposed of. Hmm… the name was… well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was too young, I wasn’t really interested, and it hasn’t been on the test yet, so I don’t remember much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was aware of such a big event in the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『……the Bockmati Family……?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, yes! That’s it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally remembered the name when he said it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it seemed to be an organization that Tre’ainar also knew, and he had a slightly surprised expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… they have fallen?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Did you know them?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well…… there were useful. In addition, the boss of the organization was also a known Martial Artist, one of the Six Supremacy even acknowledged his strength.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It sounds a little nostalgic…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The boss of the Bockmati family……’Inai’ expanded the organization with his stout arm, and with fearless audacity, he went to the Demon Realm and traded directly with the Demons.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…… Inai… certainly, I saw the name spread in the Imperial City Newspapers. The Imperial Knights captured him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… then…… already……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar had a complicated expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Why? Tre’ainar said he didn’t trade directly, but I don’t think that’s all there is to it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t think Tre’ainar would lie, but did he have some important dealing he was emotionally attached to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I was about to ask that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somebody, help me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Uhhh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a crowd around the corner, where a naked woman caught in a net was seeking help.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I saw the woman, I was shocked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, the con woman from earlier!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Oh, geez…It wasn’t me. Hey~, what’s up with you, why so angry?” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the woman saw me, her face turned pale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, my anger outweighed my questions about the situation and her nudity and all that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you! Return the 50,000 that you just took!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, wait, I have nothing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no way! It just happened!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s true, look at the state I’m in, utterly naked! A weird girl robbed me saying, ‘This money is confiscated’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, her naked body and huge milk jugs, which were swollen red for some reason, as if slapped many times in anger… I don’t care, it’s not! [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also, don’t let the boobs and stuff fool you again, me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Too bad! You trample on people’s good will! Purity! What the hell is wrong with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I didn’t cheat you… I gave you a vase, right? You’re the one who was convinced 50,000 was its worth and paid up, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A dirt cheap vase, don’t quibble with the guy you fed false stories for sympathy to take his money.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m trying my best not to be fooled again, the hand-print on her breast… I desperately turned my eyes away from the breasts, and I lash out at the woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I don’t know why the woman was robbed, but I have to ask her to pay me back my money, even if it was a causal retribution.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… It was not a theft, but a price of a vase was given and money was exchanged neatly, and the deal was settled. You’re the one who’s uncouth after it was approved, pal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s the way it is. It’s against the city’s rules to try to resolve a deal that has been settled with violence, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it sucks you got deceived.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Three men came out to the front, parting out the crowd.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “AH? What the hell, you guys.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The men who came out are young, and they may be older than me, but they are in their late teens to early twenties?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of them wore long black coats for some reason, and the clothes had some flashy embroidery.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the hair style, a weird baguette like shape rose from the guy’s head. No, really, what is that? [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, Date. I heard a strange woman was attacking you and I rushed over… what happened?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, you’re too late! ‘Kamikaze Gang’! Get me down quickly and catch the woman who robbed me of my money! And take care of the brat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good grief, Calm the fuck down. He’s just a freaking kid? Well~, you fell for it, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, they seem to be acquainted with the woman… or rather, is she famous in this town?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, they’re from big bro’s gang.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gonna put those figures to good use today too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, good job bros!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, no ‘Bro Leader’ today? If you stay, I’ve got some good booze for you later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The merchants of the city are cheering with a smile on their faces at the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But to me, it looks like the strange men suddenly got in the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the guys approached me in a familiar manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, brother. There are rules in this town. Don’t complain after a deal is done… let alone resort to violence. I’m sorry you have been duped by this thot, but take it as a tuition fee and give up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s the way it is. If you don’t properly follow the rules, dudes like us show up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the men stood shoulder to shoulder me and tapped my head… it was irritating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time, somehow I understood these guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys? You’re the underworld in this town? Just when you think the Bockmati family was ruined, there are still people like you guys?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An underworld organization which managed the town that my father should have already destroyed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even if you think that it’s gone, a new alternative organization would be established again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though not as refined…………
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha…… Hey, don’t go lumping us with those Bockmati sh*ts.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But maybe he didn’t like what I said, and the guy’s eyebrows twitched a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? Could you say that the guys defending the woman who robbed a poor teenage kid of what little money he had are loftier than the people of the organization that perished?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was honestly irritated by the encounter, so I went tit-for-tat with provocative words at the guys who showed up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But in my words……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, wait there, guys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! I don’t know who the kid is, I don’t even know what’s going on, I don’t know about the Kamikaze gang.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Surprisingly, it wasn’t the guys who responded first, but the merchants in the city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone looked offended at words and tried to argue back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, wait and see, uncles. It may be quite ignorant to pick a fight with us in this town, but it’s ballsy of this pompous prat, the nerve on this kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys took control of the opposing voices by themselves, only one of them stepped forward and snapped his fist, and faced me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s okay. We don’t just work over those who break the rules… it is also the team’s rule to buy a fight that’s been sold. So, come on!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I come this far, even I, who is said to be dull, knew where this was going.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, we’re going to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, wait a minute. I don’t want violence or a fight. I just want my 50,000 back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. But, even if we don’t get the situation, we think that making fools of us is selling a fight. If you don’t like it, you can apologize on your knees.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah? Apologize? I don’t know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re much simpler and easier to understand than those merchants who try to sell products you don’t know whether they are fake or genuine or strange women that forced their bosom on you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then come on, brat! We’ll engrave the Kamikaze Gang on your body, mind, and heart!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so, the man with the baguette head raised both fists and held it. At the same time, the crowd gathered round and cheers rose up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Remember it! I’m the Third Suicide Fighter of the Kamikaze Gang, the name is -“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, it doesn’t even resonate in the Imperial Capital over the mountains, so that’s about it, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… before the cheers rose, and before anyone gave their name, I jumped into the opponent’s pocket with a momentary step-in and smashed with the left… and stopped it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, eh…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””………… Eh??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the person himself, from that moment, while the merchants, who expected to see a fight of the organization they seemed to adore for some reason, were frozen with their mouths wide open, I nimble went by the Baguette head guy and ran towards the other two men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hold on… What the fuck is ――― eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a rush, the guy threw a right fist counterattack but I crossed that right fist and threw a counter to the man’s face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Light Cross”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I stopped just before…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, ah, ah…… th-this guy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I immediately turned to the other, and, before he had finished talking, stopped a screw-like punch on the chin and the right temple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, everyone was speechless, and the three men who appeared were rather taken aback than dazed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I guess that’s it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a little different from Tre’ainar’s quest for authenticity, but before the fight, I knew that the three would not be the match for me by their manners, their muscles and their form.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, to the three who were stunned…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is a merchant town, right? Then you guys… must learn to discern the true power of the opponent you’re fighting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I said, as if I were looking down on them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Notes
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally returned to Japan, went to Nagoya for three consecutive holidays, and finally came back. Refreshed? No, on the other hand, I’m tired, but tomorrow… no, I’d like to start from today.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And everyone was worried about a lot of things, but there were no problems such as immigration and check-in overseas. Rather, the metal detector was smooth and said “good”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there were some unexpected things. What in Nagoya! I stayed at a capsule hotel, but the room temperature was high, so when I was wandering around in just the right outfit, I was warned, “the guest should not walk around in that…” I apologize to all the staff.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Yeah, when in a jam, go [the Shaggy route].
