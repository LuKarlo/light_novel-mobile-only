<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, authenticity… you say?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar threw a retort at my remark, but he seemed to be in a slightly good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However, tis better to not get too carried away by overwhelming the small fry, is it not? If you overdo it, you may appear as the weak one.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Osu.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These guys aren’t a threat to me. Tre’ainar’s words to me weren’t ‘Don’t let your guard down’, but rather ‘Don’t get too carried away’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking that it’s typical of Tre’ainar, I looked down on the three guys who stayed down due to shock then nimbly hopped on the spot and stepped back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, are we done?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked, the three guys stood up in unison.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, we were caught off guard… heh, you’re not an amateur. You learned that somewhere, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But for you to stop, what a softy.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By any chance, an Imperial Pushover?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The three of them smiled and took a stance, their battle spirit unbroken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll tell you, this is not how the Kamikaze Gang fights!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, if you think that’s the measure of the Kamikaze Gang’s strength, you’re so wrong!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pulling your punches hah? I’ll treat this cheeky brat to our deadly special full course!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It might have fired these guys up apparently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I’d like to hit you anyway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s a special full course? Older guys nowadays have terrible naming sense.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What was that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This full course of yours, you’ll have to accept a return on the goods, at all cost! Come on, I’ll take all three of you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis why you should not get carried away… well, not that I care…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’m really going to hit you this time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was told not to get carried away, I was still in a bad mood because the encounter irritated me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I challenged the three of them to come all at once, and with a snap, the guys shouted and raised their voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bastard! Don’t look down at us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s do it! We mastered the underworld’s strongest martial art, ‘Arcane True Zenith Style’ in 3 days!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re gonna regret getting cocky with us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the three guys nodded to each other, lined up, ran straight at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The assault of the three guys wearing black coats…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””We’ll show you, hooligan pride of the Kamikaze Gang, Black Three Prong Star of the Arcane True Ze-“””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I felt like Tre’ainar had tilted his head, but I don’t care…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon Body Blow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Hebu, Bugo, Domu!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such an unsavory full course, I can’t accept that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I slammed it into the body of the guy at the front and the momentum of the blow hit the other guys behind him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, what!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s that kid?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That guy, so absurd! Those three in an instant!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, somebody call ‘Leader Bro’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, the merchants around me raised their voices in astonishment at the sight of three guys who fell down and couldn’t immediately stand up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I realized, that woman was gone…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn…… did she run away in the chaos… now what do I do …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Hmm? Hey, Tre’ainar, what’s wrong? You look strange.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nothing… just…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the time, Tre’ainar who was beside me seemed worried about something, as he stared at the three guys on the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what got you bothered……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gaha, ba, bastard… Yo, you dare.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then, the guys got up. However, it seems they won’t be able to stand up easily this time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…… Yo-you getting all smug just because you’ve beaten us? We have some allies on our side, you see… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, it sounds like a pathetic throwaway line that appears in a story, doesn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, wh-what’s that!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, bothering with every nuisance anymore would be particularly troublesome.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To begin with, that woman got away…… Or should I give up on the 50,000 and think about how to manage with the remaining 30,000?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bastard, you’re gonna regret this! You’ve turned the most dangerous man in the empire, the one person you shouldn’t, into an enemy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, yes, yes… I’m so scared, so I’ll be going now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can you keep company with a gang member forever?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, simple daily necessities and food… and then, money of course. It’s money after all, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey! Really, don’t go! The boss, our Big Bro, he’ll be here soon! And when Bro arrives, he’ll…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I was thinking about buying and selling treasure on the cheap in this town, but, in the first place, it doesn’t seem that treasures are easily mixed in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Tre’ainar said something like “business” to me, but what kind of business…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “—have, hey! That’s why you shouldn’t ignore me! Get back here! Damn, somebody call Bro now! Bro! Bro! Brooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s been a while since……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good Grief(Yare Yare)… I can hear you. Don’t yell people’s names in the street, it’s embarrassing, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that was when.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Domouf!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Geh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just as I was about to rebuke him for being too noisy, a man suddenly appeared and lightly swung his fist on baguette head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So…… you guys…… what are you doing to my hometown?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the moment the man appeared, both the baguette head and the merchants smiled with their eyes shining as if a ‘hero’ had arrived.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, Bro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo, you’re too damn noisy, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro, listen! I hate to say it, but…… we’ve lost.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can tell without looking. Well, I’m not surprised you guys lost, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such, so, so bright!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 White trousers in a long white coat with flashy embroidery and patterns.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He wears a large white hat so deep on his head that it hides his ears, and with a lit cigarette in his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, hah~, don’t worry about it. No shame in defeat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thing is, I don’t like it when you call my name afterwards, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had a slender build, so tall and slim… but…… I could tell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… heh~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… un……no? This one…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked slender, but you can see it through his clothes. Quite…… not gonna play… so-so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, if you’re gonna rely on others after losing a fight, why don’t you guys just do it from the start? Only pick a fight with those who don’t mind fighting, even if you get yourselves wrecked as a result. You don’t even have the guts to do that, that’s why you ran away from ‘Arcane True Zenith Style’ after three days, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro………… Well, that’s true, but…… But that kid tried to break the rules of our town and turned to violence! We can’t stay quiet when a guy breaks the rules, right? It’s common sense!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why, you guys decided on your own with the geezers and the like. When was all that approved by the Imperial Assembly and became a law? I don’t give a sh*t who’s from out of town, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh, th-that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a little too much to make such a selfish rule, fight to push it through, then have the tables turned on you only to rely on people and to talk about common sense when at your own convenience, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked quite young. Probably a normal teenager… Even though…… he’s got a keen eye, those guys were wild, vulgar and not too bright, but he has a very calm demeanor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you call it…Dignity? It felt like something I can’t explain was overflowing from his body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Remember. When a ‘hoodlum’ starts to follow the common sense of the world, it’s all over, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And even some kind of light sermon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, for a hooligan’s head, that’s kind of unexpected.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, are you the chap who got caught up in some trouble or are you raising a fuss? You’re young… a kid?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? A-ah…… a strange woman took 50,000 for a dirt cheap vase.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, ah~…… Date…… Kakka…… that lady’s no good, isn’t she? Well, that was unfortunate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man turned to me. He spoke in a calm tone, and with a smiling face while holding his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And you, who have been so unfortunate, have two choices.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the man……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Either you get down on your knees with an apology, or I get my one-on-one fight, those two.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Tut? Ah? Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He made an unexpected proposal to me in the same tone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, really, you gotta be kidding me! Why would I put up a fight! It’s none of your business in the first place!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh no~, well, might be true, but you know, even though they’re such idiots who rely on others, they’re still my buds that you gone done in. You gotta make that distinction, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You tell your people not to rely on others, yet you’ll actually do it! What kind of logic is that?　So messed up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course. Do I look like a decent chap you can talk to?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even for a moment, I thought he might be a little understanding, but the unexpected choices made me raise my voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the man told me so with straight eyes without fear at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The scum, trash and hopelessly reckless fellows of the world who are incapable of doing normal things or following common sense. That’s what we are, the ‘hoodlums’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Messed up logic. I’m aware of that, but the man who laughed thinking, “So what?” as he hoped I would fight back, called his group the “Hoodlums”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, how annoying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakka. Well, the selfish world and the age of the delinquents have gone on in such a way. That’s why it’s worse than the Mafia.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He proudly laughed while admitting that he’s a piece of sh*t.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, this is a type I’ve never met before, this guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, but I don’t have the heart to put in an apology, do I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, as the chap whose buddies were done in, I have to put life on the line and obtain it, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, though he was laughing, somehow his expression tightened… and the air…… changed?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… this guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what. It felt strange.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not a sharpened air like with the princess or Rebal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not an overwhelmingly crushing air like Mr. Aka either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know what you’ve come here for, but… as the chap throwing his weight around in my hometown, kid or not, you will be given a grand welcome…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh… is that the rule of this town?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it’s my style.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it’s calm, it feels like it’s somehow enveloping, and the enveloping air is gradually heating me up inside… the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how strong he is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If you cannot discern it… you have no choice but to step in and find out.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar, who had been silent, whispered in my ear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Surely…… warriors and soldiers…… different from mages, hunters, killers and mafias… Well, I could say tis just a ridiculous, reckless idiot…… living by his own beliefs… feels that way.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also, in some respect, with this guy…… he seems unable to take a measure of this man called Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s unusual.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I agreed with what was said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then put your body up so I can grind you against the ground!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~. Aren’t you stylish, brother. So blazing. A brat, but…… you’re manly, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, as Tre’ainar said, I decided to jump in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a light step, the Great Demon Flicker stance was set.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, silly kid! Are you going to take on Bro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro’s the best~ he graduated from the ‘Arcane True Zenith Style’ dojo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guys I beat and merchants raised astonished voices at my appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, what’s that something dojo anyhow?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… Tre’ainar…… have you heard of it?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Never… tis as if…… but…… I am a tad concerned…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, is it a pretty low-profile dojo that even Tre’ainar doesn’t know, as you can expect?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as long as it is unknown, we must be vigilant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when I tightened my mind and lowered my waist a little, Bro scratched his head a little shyly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, stop already, you guys. It’s embarrassing. I mean, most people don’t know anything about that. Besides, the road a man walked and the effort he put so far do not matter in a fight, it is not enough to talk with the mouth. We talk as we clash, and the winner wins, that’s the only rule, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s kind of refreshing, but it’s as if I’m going to lose, and Bro’s got confidence.
</div>
