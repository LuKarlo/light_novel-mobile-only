<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So-so…… quite…… no, that’s not the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the fight began, the atmosphere gave the impression that he is not an ordinary guy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is not an opponent that could be compared to petty small fries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, let’s wait and see while putting in some practice with the fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Flicker!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My left with a snap like a whip.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s impossible to tell at first sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ate, te, itete…… o, ~ooh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, my left hit Bro on the cheek with a few shots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It hit normally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, eh? Hey, what’s with those punches just now!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Too fast, how many blows have you struck…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even Bro can’t avoid it either!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A roar rose from the surroundings. Apparently, my left is unexpected to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what about Bro in front of me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s amazing”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he was getting hit, he had plenty of composure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, guess I’ll give him a little more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If it suits you, I’ll give you extra! Soーーーraaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O~tsu!? Ate, o, oto to to.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A series of Great Demon Flicker shots.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got up close, and with my left within range, rained on Bro’s face many times.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, B-Bro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro! What are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been hitting Bro’s face with my lefts repeatedly, and I could feel it on my fist…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good grief… you’re being modest… Seiya!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, a shock struck the thigh of my left leg.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pain is as if a lightning bolt struck with a blunt instrument.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It hurt when Bro, who was being beaten so hard, hit my thigh with a kick of his right leg.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…… Low kick…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 L-Low, kick? No, but, what is this pain? Numb, the steps…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keep a distance with left-handed punches then target your opponent with the right-handed cannon… an orthodox style, but much too stale, brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, at? ……eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then something cast a shadow over my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A fight has to be flashy, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was Bro’s right leg, which kicked my left thigh, then raised the leg above my head in a wide open stance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That stance, which required a very limber body to be done, is like the open-mouthed jaw of a beast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… tis an Axe Kick!? Back away, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, ah, my leg… uaah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Tre’ainar shouted, the heel of Bro’s foot, which he raised overhead, dropped down over my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I immediately tried to back away, but a dull pain on my left leg caused a brief delay in my reaction, and as a result, Bro’s heel hit the tip of my nose…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gotta…… buh, bo!? Oh, ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blood erupted from my nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu…… nosebleed…… this guy… got me―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nosebleed. Moreover, it dripped vigorously to the ground from both nostrils.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Do not be idle, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh? tsu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I was distracted by my nosebleeds and clicked my tongue, Tre’ainar’s voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I suddenly looked up, Bro was nowhere to be seen… eh? Where?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Above!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above? The moment I looked up, Bro jumped high above, rotated in the air and put on that momentum……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t be dazed in the middle of a fight!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tch, too late! Fall down on your buttocks immediately, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without Tre’ainar’s instructions, I’d definitely have received Bro’s heel down on my head or face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I sat on my butt and evaded Bro’s kick, or rather let it pass over my head, the sound of a wind noise, as if a sword was vigorously swung, was heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…… avoided. You’re good, brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nya, no, no! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… a spinning kick around the body rotation…… this man……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s using some weird footwork. But, he can’t keep it up forever!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pain in my left leg is still there, but it’s nothing compared to Aka’s punch!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn! What a mushy practice!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakka…… the boiling point is low… but I don’t hate it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Overhand!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I stopped chiming in with my left.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Turned the right full swing……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Rolling Sobat!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Bro flew on one leg, and hit a strong kick to my overhand while spinning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… a back flip to a roundhouse kick…… no…… this is…… Sobat?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My right fist, made a strange sound… no, I, can’t lose!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooooooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis no use…… a kick is three times as powerful as a fist… to break it…… spare nothing! Use it!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, I can’t lose here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I went toe to toe with Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, if I get tossed around here, I’ll have to apologize to Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For Mr. Aka’s sake, who left my side to protect me from my own weakness…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As if I could lose in a place like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Ah, this light…… this technique……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s flyyyyyy! Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a simple wait and see, I immediately got tossed around and almost overpowered here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My assessment was unreliable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To think there was such a crazy hooligan in a place like this, but this guy…… Bro is strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The other day I battled against those ninja warriors…… perhaps, they were at the level of Advanced Imperial Warriors……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I still can’t see the bottom of his strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why this was the right choice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Push through with the Breakthrough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In this state, a little numbness in my legs is not a problem!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Goose Step!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After disrupting the opponent’s timing by stepping from deceleration to sudden acceleration and jumping into his reach in an instant……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A left smash. I swung off with enough power to blow the opponent’s neck off. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakka…… I was shocked… amazing, brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did he see through it? Did I make too big of a swing? Bro avoided my fist by slightly shifting his upper body to the back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead, my fist shattered the cigarette that Bro was holding in his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Overhand!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The full swing in pursuit of his face again……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Zinga Step!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I thought about it, did Bro drop his hips and avoid my full swing with a unique step that swayed side to side while defending his face?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He didn’t avoid it… I couldn’t perceive it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Zinga!? This man… why that step? Certainly not…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who is this guy really? A man like this, unknown to the Empire…… Why?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was something I’ve never seen before either, having learned a lot of steps in ladder training.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, Bro went outside the range of my fist at that chance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But he’s not moving fast enough. I was a little taken aback, but I shouldn’t be confused with my speed, my visual acuity, and my peripheral vision…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But let’s go! 【Great Demon Corkscrew Blow!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In an instant, I jumped in front of Bro, and this time to his face, I threw a full-blooded right…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Cross Counter Kick】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the sole of Bro’s foot was on my face like a cross with my straight fist… ah, a cross counter with the feet!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s dangerous! Or, not good! I can’t stop for a second! Dodge……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Jump in!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar’s words ran through my mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, at the same time, a recollection of Mr. Aka…… ah!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, oh…… 【Great Demon Headbutt!】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Feet and fists cross, and I took Bro’s kick with my forehead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, something broke, something cracked, and a dull sound was heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ka, gah…… Guh……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cracked. Head. There was definitely blood gushing out…… but, it was nothing… compared to Mr. Aka’s punch……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the heck! Ora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve endured it. I forced back the consciousness I was about to lose, and I barked to fire myself up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well actually……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… What in the world?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… these two…… wow, in just a few seconds.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I held my breath as I watched… I forgot to breathe.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I don’t get what’s going on at all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s only been a few seconds since Bro and I clashed, leaving the crowd behind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, ha~… tch. Even so, it’s trickier than opponents who wield swords and magic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t think I’ll be able to give chase right away. A slight interval. In order not to waste the breakthrough, I release it and stare at Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Bro was standing on one leg with a little bitter smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m…… surprised…… now…… got my knee … I didn’t think you’d jump into my counter…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Bro didn’t make it out unscathed now either. He’s smiling, but I can see that he’s sweating a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hurt the knee of the guy who uses foot techniques.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re the one using strange moves. In general, you said this was a delinquent fight, and then had the nerve to throw your feet around. Normally we should exchange blows with our fists, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I adjusted my breathing, I sarcastically told him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Bro shrugged both shoulders and replied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Normally. But, what do you think, brother? We’ve been standing on both feet since we were young and made our way through life. When we are in trouble, when we are in pain, when we hit rock bottom, and when we crawl down to the ground … our feet always stand us back up and move us forward, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… So?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In other words, those feet have supported, endured, and worked together with you more than anything else. Therefore, people spend their lives on their feet. Do you think that hitting with your feet is the same as striking with your life and thoughts?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, he came up with some very messy theory and logic, and said it with confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm…… I just said ‘Normally’, I’m not saying hitting each other with fists is the most necessary thing in a fight… that’s why, I can’t even say it’s feet either.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s not the fist. It’s not even the feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s most necessary in a fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I learned that the hard way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn’t that right? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I, through action, came to know…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After all…… what’s most important in a fight is…… heart!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I blurted it out with confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come, let’s go on! I’ll throw myself out and hit you with my heart without fear!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I beat my chest forcefully, raised both fists, and repositioned my fighting pose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pu, kuku…… Kakka…… Kakkakkaka!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro, on the spot, sat his butt on the ground and laughed heartily as if he had expected things to go this way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It wasn’t a laugh to ridicule me… It was somewhat happy……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I say. You got me there…… that’s right, me of all people, what I took as the origin of the fight was so far off. That’s good, brother. Amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A bleeding nose, forehead split open, and face dyed bright red, but your eyes got the same glare. Those eyes… they kind of remind me of the days when I was a bit green, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while laughing, Bro looked at me with a warm gaze, squinting as if nostalgic of the old days somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, somehow, I’m completely not in that mood… Ah, brother… you have two new choices.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “For the time being, I can still fight too, so will we continue on as is… Or, the money Date took…… I can’t give it back, but I’ll treat you to as much, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…eh, ah? Err?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I realized that the atmosphere of the scene was no longer fit for a fight, Bro gave his suggestion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only me but the proposal also surprised Bro’s friends and merchants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, eh…… Why!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn cheeky rebellious brat… I don’t hate it. I was one… we all were… so, I kinda missed that feeling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, while presenting my options, somehow the person himself already lost the will to fight, Bro stood up, hopping on one foot and approached me, and acted really familiar with his arm on my shoulders.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, ah, get off! That’s why I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, come on. First, I’ll treat you to a drink.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, that’s, listen! I’m still not old enough to drink!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really? Then we might have you ascend the stairs a little early, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Bro, hopping on one leg, dragged me along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden I tried to resist, but for some reason I couldn’t shake it off, so I was taken along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s how I met him, the smoke-stained obscure delinquent, who was unknown to the world, Bro… no… no… it was my encounter with Anek.

 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The summer vacation is a little early, and I’m writing part 3 freely, but recently I forgot that this novel is “a fantasy about magic” w Especially recently I’ve been reading old delinquent comics.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, my favorite delinquent manga ranking is 1st place: [Cuf ●s] , 2nd place: [Roku ● Nonebu ● Su] , 3rd place: [B ● Y] , 4th place: [Shonan Jun ● ●] , 5th place: [Samra ● Sol ● ya]. It’s like this, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, when I noticed, there were 2300 impressions. Thank you very much for your feedback. I noticed something strange, saying, “23=Ni-san.” Well, that’s why I took the plunge and made it such a blatant development.
