 “Oh, Bro’s as good as ever.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I guess. But that kid…… he was really strong, right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To go toe to toe with Bro. You sure got us beat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The baguette heads were walking in front of me, talking like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Weird. A few minutes after being smeared with blood and clashing into each other, why are we already rubbing shoulders?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, I was taken to a bar for the first time in my life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold, just…… hey, wait! The bar is a hangout for punks and old men! I’m not going!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, a long time ago, Sadiz raised it as one of the ‘places off limits due to its bad influence’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh… you look like a badass kid, haven’t you been to a bar before?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I really won’t come in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakka, well, just think of this as an educational tour and enjoy it, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Bro took me to a bar in town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is completely different from the stylish ones found in the Imperial City.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A tattered sign, a broken door. Some places were cracked, the walls were peeling off, the pillars were about to break, and it’s a dirty bar that is about to collapse at any moment.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not only the appearance but also the contents were the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh, uh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I entered the store, I suddenly held my mouth down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment we entered, there were empty bottles rolling on the floor, red-faced delinquents lying drunk on tables or the floor, men laughing with women sitting beside them, and women with scant clothing making a scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, the smell was mixed with the stench of alcohol, tobacco, and vomit, wasn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve never seen such a stinky, filthy space before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that? Bro~, who’s the kid.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh~, he looks cheeky, but he’s pretty cute, isn’t he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now that you mentioned it, weren’t you going to fight the Kamikaze Gang Three-Prong star~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment we entered the store, everyone was talking as they came up to me, laughing and raising their voices as if they were all Bro’s friends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, of course, the glances were directed at me, who was shoulder to shoulder with Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, this is the kid who was scammed by Date… He knocked down the Three-Prong Star, and, well, he fought with me, too. I liked him and brought him along, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, he broke our jet stream attack,”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You had a good fight, did you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, come on in, buddy. Don’t be nervous.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro and the other gave a rough explanation about me. However, even that overly loose explanation wasn’t unusual to these folk who know the man called Bro, as everyone nodded with a smile without any particular retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you mean, a promising newcomer? Still, isn’t he young?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, nice to meet you. If you have any problems, can you count on me? That’s our rule.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm~, it’s just like Date~… Ah, maybe Big Sis will learn something good from this~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey Hey, don’t you wanna eat?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though we had a fight, he didn’t care about it and readily accepted me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, is every one of these guys always broad and don’t care about minor details?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I realized something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Which reminds me, the streets of the town are full of merchants … and I thought this was a merchant town to begin with and there weren’t many young people here, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, most of the shoppers and street vendors were adults and geezers
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there were dozens of young people in their teens and twenties gathered in this bar now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, during the day. We young’uns laze about and drink at home or in a bar during the day. At night, it’s a completely different town.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At night…… Then?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. It’s a sleepless night for us, the hoodlums, devouring the legacy left by the adults who ruled this town.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…What town?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka, you see for yourself later, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, while implying something different, Bro pushed his way through the store and naturally sat at the counter seat facing the tavern master.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here you are, you sit down, too. It’s my treat today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Bro invited me to the counter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I sat down as I was told, even though I was puzzled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I can’t drink alcohol, so orange juice please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Noーーーー!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka, hey. Barkeep, you have my bottle, don’t you? Give it here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aiyo”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And are they really going to make me drink!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but it’s against the law… However, Bro, laughing heartily, took out his cigarette and lit it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Fuh~.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t smoke next to me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ” Eh? Oh, my bad. Want a cigarette? Do you smoke?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cigarettes and booze! I’m still 15!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Far from drinking, he even offered me a cigarette.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I yelled out that it was “wrong”, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, he’s such a surprisingly good kid. Brother…… well, are you a young lord?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Raised without any inconvenience, but in the rebellious phase, did you go against your parents and ran from home? Is that the mark?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, no…… not”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so accurate, I’m at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So it’s nothing to do… with you, anyway “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. It doesn’t matter. I don’t care, people have their own reasons for being down in the dumps. Including everyone here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up… It’s not that simple…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh…… that right. Well, I’m not going to ask that much, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was annoyed and tried to put up a wall, but Bro didn’t push it much or ask me about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebelled against their parents, got wild due to a poverty stricken home, defied the teachers and took the easy way when they couldn’t keep up with the school. The influence of others. And so on. Every one of them can easily turn someone into a delinquent… it’s no use worrying about it all, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I heard that, I was surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me running from home is not unusual, for these guys because they’re delinquent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why these guys are laughing so happily, and Bro…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And often the reason for becoming a delinquent is just a little curiosity. They say that kids are not allowed to drink or smoke or get sensual.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that, Bro offered me the cigarette that he had just lit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I refused to smoke that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, smoking would be bad for the body it seems. Alcohol, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure you need to be 18 for cigarettes? I’ve heard that if you smoke, your physical strength will drop, or your lungs will get polluted, and that’s not going to do you any good at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How, You’ve never even smoked, but you have decided it’s bad for you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fifteen or eighteen are not much different, are they? Or was it published in a paper that if you smoked at 15, your body will definitely get worse?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In the first place, the age limits for smoking and drinking are the standards arbitrarily set by old men who have nothing to do with teens. Why don’t you try it yourself to see if it’s bad for your health, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, if you look at it that way… That’s not the point!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, I’m not gonna fall for a scoundrel’s invitation!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oops.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, already went through a bitter experience in this town because of that woman! That’s why I won’t smoke or drink!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I refuse to fall for some “why not” smooth talk invitation to a bad pastime.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve learned my lesson properly after being tricked by that woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Um, right. Tis good, child. You can easily smoke and drink, but once you get hooked on it, you cannot refuse easily. Tis a detriment to your health.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar nodded “Uh-hun” with his arms crossed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even though, for this Bro to say as much… getting overly-familiar wi-… ahem, to recommend something that will inhibit the growth of my disciple. Oi, the child is not yet tainted, is he?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, Tre’ainar is somewhat ‘exasperated’, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka, so cold. As your senior in life… shouldn’t you listen to this bad pastime master?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Who is the master! I am the master! What is this halfwit you just met today saying?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Quit it, this Tre’ainar? Stop getting angry and jumping over me. Or rather, Bro can’t hear you. Also, I’m kind of embarrassed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, well, if you don’t feel like going delinquent, it’s not too late for you yet. That’s good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Bro patted my head while holding the cigarette that he offered in his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “People can easily go bad. Step out a little… No, just step off. But there is no path ahead. Just a downward spiral. That’s why… it’s hard to go from being a delinquent to a normal person.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thereupon, Bro warned me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know why you’re such a dazzling fighter, but you’re not a worthless piece of sh*t in the eyes of others, unlike us. You can still be anything you want to be. If you have a place to go back to, why don’t you go home?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…… Wh, at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or else… Someday, even if you want to go back, you won’t be able to anymore… and you may end up regretting it forever… Then, even if you want to go back to your original normal, it’ll be too late, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like an adult trying to talk a runaway kid out of it… no, it’s “exactly” what it is, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, it’s none of your business. I can be anything? I know. That’s why I left home, to be something.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho~…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no reason for a hoodlum to meddle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even so, I won’t join up with some delinquents, so I pushed past him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m going to leave home, leave the empire, and become a big man!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So dazzling, aren’t you… Well…… You think about it a little more. For now, may we give a toast to the big man of the future?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch, you asshole.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that being said, while clicking my tongue, I vigorously drank the water in the glass I’ve been offered… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ge…… aah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hold on, child!? Wh-, h, hey, what are you doing?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just drank it…… ah, it was all over my head and I had a strange smell in the back of my nose, no, it was hot! Somehow, I feel so hot! I mean, is it hot in here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~Tsupeh, just wha-… What the hell was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, my bad, actually, I’d given up drinking… now, water…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sh*t, seriously! My throat, gaggling, is that water, I’ll have that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, wait, wait. That’s not water!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, the water tastes awful and the ice is stale. Hot. I see, it’s hot, isn’t it? These clothes are a nuisance, you know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, hey wait a minute, with one cup… aah~, hey, don’t take your clothes off, ah~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… gulp…… the clothes came off…… my Lord, I may die now…… better tidy up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Hey you? Miss…… I’ve seen you before.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Errr, I just became a waitress at this store, I’m Shino…… uh, nuh huh…… Kagerou.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, is that right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, let’s have these clothes washed… that’s right that’s right…… Hau ~♡”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, hey, what’s wrong with sis? She looks incredibly happy, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? I can hear a woman’s voice that sounds vaguely familiar, but no, I’m lightheaded and thirsty…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child! Return your sanity! Put down the glass you are holding and spit out what you drank! Also, the shinobi woman has infiltrated! Oi, child!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What? What is it? You know, Tre’ainar’s split into three? That’s great, he’s my master, awesome!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This story is fiction. It’s a fantasy world. Drinking and smoking by under-aged people, even further recommending and coercing, offering customers without checking their age, stealing the clothes of people who are drunk and took them off, are all illegal. A good child should never imitate these.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 * As you pointed out, I made a quick correction because I was misinterpreted about my age.
