<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve often heard adults say, “I was drunk and I don’t remember”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I always thought it was a lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In general, I did not believe that alcohol had any memory-erasing effect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought that it was only a ‘pretext’ to say such a thing, and I couldn’t possibly not remember it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when I woke up, and thought to myself, “What did I do?”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remembered exactly what I did. With great clarity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I woke up and stayed calm while holding my aching head down, then my face immediately turned pale.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I, f-feel like I was doing something terrible. Ugh, aaaaahhhh! What the hell, me! Yokatin! Moronic imbecile, stupid, idiot!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I woke up, I was in a strange room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, in a rather dirty room, there is only a bed in a simple room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On that strange bed I’m writhing in agony.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s more, and… I’m naked!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I turned over the sheets to feel a somewhat cool sensation of the passing air, and I was completely naked, not even wearing pants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Your clothes are over there.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Tre’ainar!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This is the second floor of the bar. A sort of rest room, you collapsed after making a scene, and were carried here to sleep it off for a few hours.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When he suddenly called out to me, I looked back, startled at the sound, and saw Tre’ainar, with a look of disgust, his arms folded, by the window of the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as Tre’ainar said, my clothes were neatly folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I… took off my clothes.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Be grateful for that woman… she washed your clothes by hand during the day, dried them outside.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That woman…? Eh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the next moment, I was suddenly wide awake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why, there was an “Exchange Diary” next to my clothes, which were neatly folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, no way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis the Shinobi woman.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why?! Eh? Because, we separated from Shinobu…… No, I got rice balls in the mountains!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, Shinobu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Did Shinobu wash the clothes that I took off while drunk?!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Or rather, you may not have noticed due to intoxication, but…… that woman…… she infiltrated the bar, did she not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『She changed her name, her attire, and even changed her manner of makeup and dressed in a waitress uniform with an apron on… well, at first glance you could tell.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu… In the bar…… What? That means……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course, that woman saw it, did she not? Your… nudity.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was seen. Ah, my thing, my son… oh, to a woman of the same age…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! I could die!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『My goodness…… you should ban alcohol from now on. Witnessing your antics was terrifying…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uugh…… and, it was seen…… meaning…… that, my manhood was…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh no… with Sadiz, that’s all there was to it, but… I was seen naked by a woman of the same age…… Until recently, the only ones who saw me naked were Sadiz and Tre’ainar… Now, I want to go back to the past……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And at the same age…… that was seen by a girl of the same age… for the first time since I took a bath with the princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, do not be depressed forever… rather, you, even though you were a child, with that princess…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Damn. The mental damage is severe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t look Shinobu in the face for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And also, this Exchange Diary…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I just wrote a reply, but I didn’t think it would be returned anymore… I mean, didn’t she go home with her brother and friends? No way, does she want to keep this exchange of diaries going?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, you’re following me…?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s getting a little colder, but when I casually turned over the diary, and on a new page…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuuurgh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the left and right pages of the notebook, the words were written in large letters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was scary, so I closed it immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, why are you asking about Sadiz…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I suppose she heard you speak of that maid in your drunken stupor.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, seriously… aah, scary…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I had nothing to feel guilty about. But I was scared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『For the time being, you must wake up and consider the future.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… From now on? No way… You mean Shinobu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, not that. Even though we arrived at the town with great pains, you squandered almost the entire day at that banquet.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…… Well, no, I slept for a few hours…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis already night.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What a hell. I wanted to think about shopping during the day, and what to do for money from now on, but I wasted my time with all this other stuff…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, then, what about… Bro and the others?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I left the store after they carried you here. Apparently, they work at night.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At night…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That reminds me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the young people laze about in the daytime and go out into the city at night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, this merchant town will transform at night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And…… this town at night may be worth your attention.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Why……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I took a view out of the window, but… tis a different bustle than daytime, is it not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar standing by the window laughed, and I anxiously looked outside.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was surprising.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, aah? Huh? Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s night, but it wasn’t dark. Streetlights lit by fire lined the streets, and an aristocratic troupe, dressed up in the street, went hither and thither in “queer masks”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Various butterflies, crescent-shaped faces, and so on… Is it a masquerade? No, they’re playing incognito?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, other young people who have their true faces exposed…… people dressed in the same Kamikaze Gang clothes as Bro and others, walked around the town as if they were guards.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… the heck……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I overheard a brief conversation at the bar during the day… The word ‘Auction’…… was mentioned.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Auction?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An auction at Cantidan? Well, it wouldn’t be strange to hear that, but…… still……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps tis not merely an auction. Well, as the wealthy seem to be hiding their faces…… I can imagine…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell is that… What kind of auction is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Still within the realm of possibility. You will never know unless you actually go out into town.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It sounded like he was saying “See with your own eyes” even though what Tre’ainar said made it sound like he understood the general circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In the daytime, the mafia had been destroyed, and now the town seems to be run by the hoodlum in the daytime … but they do not live in a haze. They must have means for an income… That is the night of this town. I fear tis likely, they might have coalition with the mafia, to offer assistance as it is… Well, even so…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You want me to see it in person and find out?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, I suppose.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just woke up and my head hurts a little, but I still cannot afford to rest in my room until morning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve slept quite a while, so I’m not sleepy at all…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, right. Let’s just take a quick look around the town, shall we? What is the difference between day and night…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said, let’s go out and see with our own eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I put on my folded clothes and prepare to go out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『But when you go out…… you may want to be a little careful… you walk with your true face exposed.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Perhaps not only local nobles are out there, but also citizens of the Imperial Capital. Some may know your face.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…… I see…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That would be much too inconvenient, would it not? Should you go out, you ought to conceal your face as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t like it. Certainly, it’s a hassle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s something beneficial…… With that in mind, when I reached for my pants…… What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? This…… isn’t the pants I wore… They’re new.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The clothes were mine, but only the pants were changed to new ones. Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As they were battered from overuse, the shinobi woman bought a new pair and discarded the old ones.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, yeah… Hmm…… my bad. Not only rice balls, but also new pants…… I’m just being taken care of, I’d better give her something…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, it should be fine… I believe she was satisfied enough with the ‘reward’, but…… Well, you need not mind it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tilting my head at Tre’ainar’s grave words, I went outside, wearing clothes that had been washed.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
