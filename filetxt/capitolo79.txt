 『…… The vulgar air tainted with greed and avarice… cannot be hidden behind a mask… the fortunate born into prestigious families, never to strive for anything, fattened pigs…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 People in expensive clothing, wearing masks thither along the streets.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone, as if dressed for a castle ball, was heading in the same direction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But there are quite a lot of them… Moreover, looking at the clothes, it might not just be the Imperial City… some great families…… Japone’s Kimono…… attire from the Kingdom of Uragile…… Maybe they’re also coming from countries in the vicinity of the Empire…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The central street of Cantidan, which was filled with street vendors and merchants during the day, is now filled with hundreds more people who are considered to be noblemen, creeping around.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Around them, the Kamikaze Gang were sharp eyed and vigilant… what…… the hell?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Follow them…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that reason, I also hid my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fortunately, merchants on the street were selling masks, glasses, and other items that can hide one’s face, perhaps ‘for those who have forgotten their masks’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a commercial soul, I was impressed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, while there were a lot of designs with bad tastes, I found the one that was decent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a pair of glasses that workers use to protect their eyes at coal mines and mining sites……they’re called ‘goggles’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Red frames and bands with yellow glasses. I thought they looked cool, and I bought them though at 10,000, it was a bit expensive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now only I have 20,000 in my possession… Well…… Let’s really think seriously about money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anyway, let’s check out this town right now.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, I’ll check first to see what catches my interest. I put on my goggles and made my way into the flow of the nobility.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, dear…… are you sure? How many times have you participated in such events… Moreover, it is an event organized by such lowly thugs…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gufufu, there’s no need to worry. All events in this town are backtracked by Minister Chitsue, it’s safe.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But…… before, proper adults were in charge of all the security and event management… Is that all right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s fine. Rather, it would be more troublesome if the mafia were to be involved, such as being coerced or extorted later on by holding something over you, so it would be a trifle matter for these brats to be cut off at any time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The noble couple who were by the side was having such a conversation as I also joined in following the flow of the surroundings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Event…… you mean the auction?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Minister Chitsue…… is he also involved…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s been involved in politics in the Imperial Capital since the old days, and I’ve been greeted several times at parties since I was a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, although he seemed to be smiling on the surface, I’ve always thought he was somewhat fishy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What I’m worried about is, you know… about this town. You told me, didn’t you? Lord Hiro doesn’t think well of it… said he destroyed that organization…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, but it’s not a problem today. See, Hiro…… is looking for that second-rate son of his who ran away from home and has abandoned his duties!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… I wasn’t listening to them, but I just heard such a conversation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, when the conversation of the two noble couples touched the topic, the nobles around also reacted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’ve been meaning to ask you that too. As I recall, there was a problem with the Imperial City Academy student’s mock battle.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What I hear, that dunce son of his threw mud on the face of the hero in front of a large crowd and ran away from home…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu. Even though he defeated the Great Demon King, unlike our noble bloodline, he has the blood of a vulgar commoner, after all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mamu was originally the same, wasn’t she? Both parents were originally commoners, so their child was born a commoner as well. It’s no wonder they’re such failures.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And then, the fallen son ran away from home, and they abandoned their duty to the country and prioritized their personal affairs… this might lead to deprivation of their authority.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Imperial Knights were so intrusive in their politics… I wondered what I would do when he tried to crush this place for our escapism.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, we are still secure, aren’t we? Hiro and Mamu will lose their authority and Minister Chitsue will prosper after that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… what is it…… ah…… can I hit you?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Cease, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…… But…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nonetheless.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They don’t know anything about me, and yet they can say all they want beside me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was ready to do something about these pigs and old farts.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Tre’ainar won me over.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You are no hooligan…… Tis not even a fight nor a quarrel, you simply got upset, so you hit him… my lessons to you are not to have you swing such cheap fists.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well…… But……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Your value is diminished…… Now, dare to accept this assessment and swallow it…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fallen foolish son who ran away from the Imperial City after throwing mud on his parents’ faces… That’s Earth Lagann now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the extent of the value I was given after so much training with Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bullsh*t…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hohohohohoh… quite a young participant, aren’t you? Have you joined in the event before?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I looked back in a panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t expect to be accosted, so I was surprised and looked back, and there was a white-haired old man, although he was wearing a butterfly mask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He wore a Japone-style kimono, carrying a cane with him, and had a kind smile on his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, uh, no, I’m…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m sorry. This one will participate for the first time today… ‘Mitsuēmon’ they call it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I talk badly, it will be troublesome, so let’s exchange only a few words and go somewhere quickly… I thought……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… um… yeah, that, I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho, no, I’m sorry. It was my first time at such a social event, but it was hard to talk to other aristocrats, so I couldn’t resist talking to you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, he smiled gently again, and even though he was a participant in this procession, the air seemed to be quite different from that of the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eyes that appear behind the mask are different from those that are painted with greed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm……?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Tre’ainar looked at the old man and reacted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『This White Elder…… Somewhere……?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you know who he is, Tre’ainar? This isn’t just any old man, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But certainly, the aura around him, it’s hard to describe… despite being a small elderly man, it’s somewhat warm and inviting, yet grand and imposing… to say it aptly… it weighed with experience…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Elder…… who are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It is unwise to confirm each other’s identity in a place like this, isn’t it? That’s what I’d like to say… I’m no one suspicious… just a crepe wholesaler from Japone.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Crepe……? What is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But you… is this your first time? You don’t seem to be used to it… the shining eyes behind those goggles…… feels good.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the Old man looked at my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m sorry, you don’t want to hear that from a strange old man, do you? I’m afraid at this age…… I don’t have much chance to talk with the brilliant young children of the new age… the ones who shine brighter than ever before and I can’t help but be bothered by it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Elder…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Young ones in this town… I don’t think they’re rotten, but… the look in their eyes was a little sad because they were resigned… not you. There is still purity and you’re lost. The fact that you’re lost means that you’re trying to find your way… you can be anything from now on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After Bro, I didn’t expect someone I had just met to compliment me to my face, it was embarrassing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That phrase ‘I can be anything’ got me fired up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But such a young man…… why are you here? You don’t seem to be interested, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why is it, I wonder?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Due to the matter with the woman that day, I’m aware that my ‘eye for people’ is not great.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Elder…… I’m not from this town… I simply…… wanted to know what’s going on here… I…… I have no idea what I’m doing here… I heard about the auction, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, I don’t know… all I have to do is jump in and see… I was wondering if I could find a way in somehow.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder why. It’s not about trusting this Old man or anything like that… I didn’t tell a lie for some reason… I was talking honestly……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is strange… if you’re not a child of this town… if you don’t know what you’re doing, why are you interested?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why? That’s it. In the first place, I have nothing to do with what’s going on in this town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The purpose in this town was to stop by during the journey and think about shopping and doing something about money.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I’d rather not get into any trouble by going even deeper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because Tre’ainar said to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not only that, but I myself am interested in this gathering now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how you think about it, this event doesn’t seem to be respectable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I can imagine that it’s an illegal auction, but I have no reason to interfere with it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m here now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My friends are involved… so I want to know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That remark came out naturally somehow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Friends? With who? Bro? We had a little fight, we drank, we danced, we frolicked, we laughed… That’s what friends are for…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho…… I see… However, even if you get in line, eventually you’ll be checked at the entrance and have to pay an advance, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuugh…… Really?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hufufun, so… very well. Would you become this one’s attendant, and together join in as well?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, errrr?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was confused by my own words, the Old man, who I had never met before, laughed and said that with conviction and a good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’d appreciate it if you could let me in, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Inkyo! Come he’s this way?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just then, cutting through the crowd in the opposite direction, two men with masks on their face made their way towards us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are they referring to this Old man?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… hmmm?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Inkyo…… I’d appreciate it if you’d stop moving about as you please.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You had us all worried, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These two…… the two men who appeared. They were wearing kimonos peculiar to Japone, but… their appearance and the air around them…… I don’t know… These two.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho, I’m sorry.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not at all…… Well, in any case I’d like to make a report.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A moment ago, I just caught a glimpse, but… it’s that…… mumble mumble, the Stoke family…… daughter, Shinobu, mumble mumble.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!? Why is she in this town? …… No way, any other…… the brothers, too?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t know. But just in case, O-Inkyo don’t leave our side.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the man was talking to the Old man ear-to-ear, and he looked a little surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s going on?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Go-Inkyo. Who is this young man?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Another man looked at me and asked the Old man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Old man……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hohoho. That’s right ‘Ashisotu-san’, ‘Kesu-san’. When we enter, this child will also join us as my companion.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”…Eh??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying so, he smiled.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
