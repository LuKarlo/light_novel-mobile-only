 ――In such a short time, all answers correct … My little man. At last, my lessons are going through… Yoyoyo
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And so, with tears of joy, Sadiz granted me permission to go out before dinner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All questions were answered correctly in a short time. I’ve never had such a pleasant feeling, and I did a guts pose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, as thanks I’ll take you where you like.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Um. Then go where is most prosperous. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, leave it to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got out of the mansion, passed through the high-end residential area, and arrived at the downtown area, which is also the center of the Imperial city.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A lot of development… There is no air of slaughter as during the war… Such positivity…… Tis so peaceful. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And this is… those fellows, the world they gained by overthrowing me…… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Outside for the first time in over ten years. The Sky. The City. Civilization. And a lot of people.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It may be complicated for Tre’ainar, a demon and enemy of mankind, but it was also the moment when he was finally able to go out into the world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Tre’ainar was silently watching the scene in front of him for a while.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I’m tired! I don’t know, I’m up for a drink today.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, welcome. Your wife would like this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah! Move along buddy. Get lost!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A scene that spreads. It’s a common “daily life”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mama, what’s for dinner today?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, what do you want?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Steak!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Today is Daddy’s payday, so I think I’ll splurge a little.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Men on their way home from work. Housewives with children shopping for dinner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were many young students at the end of the school day chatting with their friends while leaving school.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… So…… What do you think of this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you feel about this scene? I asked with a simple interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis absolutely deplorable. A gathering of wretched human filth. Living their feeble lives with constant chatter and smiles. How I wish to exterminate them right now. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though it’s a spirit body, his cold eyes sent a shiver down my spine and I was conscious of his bloodlust.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The guy I thought would be useful was still the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『However… no matter my opinion, I am the vanquished… as such, at most I shall ascertain my impressions. My actions can have no consequence on the future, beyond that. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There, at least I didn’t feel any resentment or hatred.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary, reflecting on his own outlook made him laugh out loud. Looking at his back he seemed a little aggrieved, but the Great Demon King nodded convincingly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, I have yet to convince you. Nothing I can do about it now. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it can’t be helped anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just because I was the only one who could see and hear his voice, it is not possible for the Demon King to affect the world now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why all he can do is to see the world my father and his comrades have won through me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I feel a little pity for this guy who can only do that, but I decided not to ask any more questions, because it was not my place to say anything about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, this is how the Demon King is honestly expressing my feelings, and hearing that I asked other things I was concerned with.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey…’The Hero’, Hiro…… My father… Was he strong?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh? Hiro? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. I’m my father’s son, but I haven’t had any practice with him, and now we’re at peace, so I’ve never seen him fight seriously.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My father is the great existence who I can’t avoid always being compared to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I do not know father’s actual ability because I only know the achievements and honors that he accomplished.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that respect, he and my father were adversaries who fought to kill each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a sense, it is no exaggeration to say that he knows my father’s power more than anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hiro… my opinion of…… your father… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “yeah.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Or rather, the Heroes…… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a slightly serious expression, he looks back on the past, and Demon King looked like he’s talking about my father.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The Hero party was very unfair and could not read the situation! Tis no exaggeration to say they know not the meaning of ‘fair and square’! Aaaah, so abominable!! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… he’s holding a preposterous grudge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no, wait. Unfair…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The very height of cowardice! How is that acceptable? At the final battle… They invaded the Great Demon Palace… and the seven warriors led by Hiro reached my base. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seven people… Oh…… ‘The Seven Heroes of Humanity’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes! However, usually when it comes to that junction, should single battle between the Demon King and the strongest hero not decide the fate of the world? However, they… all seven, attacked in unison! Including your mother!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Great Demon King’s aura which seemed to have revived a little while ago blows up in a rage that hit with such furious momentum.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Exactly! Moreover, as if it was not ridiculous enough, that Hiro… “Humanity all over the world, grant us your power” to implore such an outrageous appeal, and all mankind did send power to Hiro, beaten I was by a huge sword that combined all that power together! Absolutely unfair! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well… If you stand on the side of the heroes and listen, you would be moved as the heart of humanity united as one.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, from his point of view, it is certainly a bit unfair to have to fight alone against all of humanity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But as the leader of the Demon army, you would have to represent your side…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…………』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At that time, did your subordinates -“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No more questions. Enough for today! Show me the city again tomorrow! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When it seemed the mood became awkward, the Great Demon King immediately derailed the conversation to forcibly bring it to an end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, it was a subject I should not touch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uuugh… geez, but I’ll be at the academy tomorrow, so it’ll have to be afterwards.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Worry not. I am also interested in the institutions that nurture human warriors. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, it seems that there is no harm to me, and this one can’t do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been possessed by something strange, but I can go along with it for a little bit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Child. The books that are stacked in the bookstore over there…… also some promotion, but… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the Demon King who stops me on the way to the mansion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking back, the Demon King was looking at a bookstore with a small crowd in front.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come to think of it, I’m sure today…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh. ‘Destiny Grand Order’ released today… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sequel to the world-famous series of novels will be released. I’m not interested, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Wh, what, that? Does it have anything to do with ‘Destiny Stay Night’? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… was that an early entry from about twenty years ago? It’s been made into a series, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? Tis now a series? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the Demon King looked as if he had been struck by lightning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the Great Demon King, who by all means should have been able to receive a high-level lightning spell with no damage, opened his mouth with a really shocked expression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Oi, purchase it. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He suddenly struck his face at mine, and talked with bloodshot eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, why would the Great Demon King… want a human book…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Race has naught to do with culture! I read it long ago…… I despise your people, but that story fascinates me.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! Are you really the Great Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Really! Now go on, child… present it to me! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~!? Why me!? Also, how will you read even if I bought it! You can’t touch books.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You can turn the pages! Do not mock me! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “S, so stuborn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first, I was irritated, him being all self-important, but in the end he seemed very pitiful. Well, if it’s just one book…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Aah, okay already. I’ll buy it for you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A worthy cause! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s so delighted with just that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For now, I’m just going to wait and see what happens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah… however, can you buy it? That book had depictions of some extremes in the early days and should have been age-restricted … 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? Is that so? No…… I’m sure it’s been rewritten for all ages.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If restrictions apply, there are other ways. I once bought two reference books for my studies and put in-between them…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, you also use the sandwich strategy when buying ero-books?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Well, let’s wait and see. A little longer……
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
