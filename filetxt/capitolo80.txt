 “Uooooh! Diligently, abide by the rules once you come in! No stepping out of line or going in without permission!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Once you’re checked at the entrance you may then go in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hearing the cries of the hoodlums shouting loudly, the procession of the nobility finally reached the depths of the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph, these delinquents, lower than commoners, quite noisy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, they’re monkeys who barely know how to speak, but we should avoid getting into trouble for making them mad, so don’t worry about it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh yes, idiots don’t know what to do when they’re in a foul mood.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the far end of the city is a run-down building, and hoodlums lightly checked the nobles at the entrance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Welcome…… I’ve confirmed the invitation. There is no problem, please go inside.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you very much.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me, I was with the old man, and I had no particular problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, the hoodlums seem to have an eye on me, but they didn’t particularly pursue the matter, as if the letter of introduction they got was from a big shot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thank you, Elder… Who are you, really?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho, I’m just a crepe wholesaler.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The old man laughed as he said so. If he doesn’t show his bottom, you won’t easily be able to reveal his true identity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, hiding our true identity is a mutual matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as the check was completed and we went inside, there was a staircase leading directly underground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I went down the dim stairs, I heard a sort of cheer from out of nowhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if it’s underground… it’s so deep…… and the voices……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, it looks like it’s going to be exciting.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, it’s a mysterious underground space that you check in at the entrance to enter… it’s suspicious… Well?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There must be something underneath, something spiraling with desire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Will there be a devil or a snake?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to see the answer, at last I opened the door of the lowest floor, and all of a sudden a blaze of heat and intense light struck me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa…… this is”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A completely different world that extends underground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A large crowd gathered in the huge underground square, and excitement was everywhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha-ha! A lot of it today! All right, miss, chip!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right ♡, where would you like the chip? The bottom? Or the chest?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, here! I’ll put it in here! I’ll put it in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, dear, sir, I can’t do that!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tit-tays! I want to buy a woman! Otherwise, we’re going to war!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At one corner of the open space, all kinds of dishes are arranged in a self- serving buffet, and the hoodlums served drinks to entertain the nobles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There is a pole hanging from the ceiling on the table where the meals are served, and many sexy women are dancing while exposing their skin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Men, with their nostrils stretched out, held fists full of gold, inserted money into women’s underwear and cleavage, touched their breasts and butts in the turmoil, and the women laughed with a friendly grin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Open…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dah, sh*t, we lost!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me too! No more cards! Let’s play roulette.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I’ll double it and give it back to you! Lend me some money!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, in one corner, the hoodlums became dealers, playing card games and roulette… and most notably…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, I’ll bet on the demon wolf!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You ah! I’m going with the bug!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! Take him down! Take him down! Take him down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what are you doing? I bet a lot of money on you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A huge iron cage in the center. And trapped in it, fighting…… beasts?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Woooooooooooo!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Graaaaaaaagh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two beasts stained with blood from each other, collided violently and their blood splashed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s it! Bite!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Behind you! Knock him down with your club!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Crap, what’s the matter with you? Look, there, go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The nobles, with a look of delight, cried out with excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…… This…… is a gambling house’s specialty… fighting beasts, Duel Monster.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was standing there, stunned by the atmosphere of the underground space, the Old man, who was next to me, whispered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Duel?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um. They put on a show that makes beasts fight, and bet on who would win… that’s the way it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wolf was being tossed about, at the mercy of the demon insect’s attacks and swift movements.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “After the war…… the beasts that were stuck on the surface were captured and used to make money… originally an idea of the Bockmati Family.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In those days, it seems even highly intelligent demons who understood human language… Ogres, Fiends, Cyclops, and so on, were forced to fight… but they are using beasts now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Capture demons…… making money?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, but isn’t that illegal? Betting with demons…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Highly intelligent demons who understood human language…… it came to be prohibited by the treaty with the Demon Realm. However, even among the demons, if they don’t speak human language… they are treated the same as animals, not humans… because they may attack humans, they get killed or captured in defense. Therefore, against beasts, it is not yet legally ‘forbidden’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s…I don’t know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hohoho, would you use a cow, a horse, or a dog to make a spectacle? Something similar…… that’s the outcome.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The mafia that was in charge of this was crushed. But here it continues.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a secret gambling house, but… still, it’s not against the law… a gray area…… That’s why even if there’s an investigation by the Imperial Knights and so on, there’s no particular reproach.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the form that Bro and others took over…… and as I heard earlier, the upper echelon of the Empire are involved, like Minister Chitsue… Where’s father? Does he know? His Majesty?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Huh…… Well, even in the Demon Realm, there are such spectacles using Beasts, such as demon fighting dogs and magic bullfights, and tis something that Magic Beast Protection Groups often made a fuss about…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I glanced at Tre’ainar. With a cold, but somewhat sad expression, he gazed at the monsters fighting in the cage.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It gave me mixed feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the words that Tre’ainar told me the other day were overlapped by the Old man’s words, “Demons that do not speak human language are treated the same as animals.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…I see…In other words, this is where the aristocracy gather… A gambling house…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, the Mafia had been eradicated… but a part of the Empire’s upper class secretly handed the reins over to the Hoodlums… Well, there are various reasons why it was handed over to the Hoodlums……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, as youth gangs, who used to earn money by violence, pick-pocketing and spying on the streets, was rampant… the seed of delinquency has found a source for their livelihood.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure, I was a little surprised, but I could imagine to some extent that ‘Well, there would be something like this’, so while I felt uncomfortable in various ways, I wasn’t too upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there was one thing that bothered me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that it? But then… what about the ‘auction’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, originally I was told that there was an ‘auction’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I thought it was an auction that dealt with illegal items that couldn’t be handled very often.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, this is a merchant town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if it’s just a gambling house……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There is. The auction. Because…… it should be the main attraction. And it is for the merchants.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Old man went from a gentle expression and looked over the hall with strong and severe eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you… know of horse racing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Horse racing? That’s a race between horses, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um, yes… so do you know, then, that betting is usually done at the horse race?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, of course…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of a sudden? I thought, but I nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s common sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reason is that in the Imperial Capital, military horses were used as racehorses to compete for the fastest and to race.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it was natural to bet on which horse would take first place, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I couldn’t bet due to age restrictions, I wasn’t allowed to go to the racetrack because of Sadiz’s education… but why would you ask me that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Those who have money very soon… will no longer bet on horse racing. They will be the owners of the horses and run their horse to win the race… that’s the way it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Eh? Oh…Certainly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was what the Old man said.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, some of the noblemen I’m acquainted with also buy horses to put them in races.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And since horses are expensive, they are bought as hobbies and entertainment for those who can afford them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s what an auction is all about…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was surprised at the Old man’s words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh I see… auctions……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey…… Well, again…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, as the Old man said, it’s normal to buy racehorses at auction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, this might not be unusual either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s subtle to me right now, but……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are the hoodlum’s making money by doing that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He involuntarily made a bitter smile. It was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a noble pig struggling at a table, as a delinquent held him by the chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The delinquent, wearing the clothes of the Kamikaze Gang, struck while the surroundings suddenly began to stir.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Sir… a little touch might be a woman’s service, but as you were told at first, buying a body, forcibly attacking, or any other act the lady dislikes is a violation of the rules?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The woman who was dancing on the pole was protected by the delinquent as she held her disheveled clothes together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, the customer who was not able to endure the woman’s sex appeal was restrained when he tried to violently take the woman by force.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it? That’s what was usually accepted before! I’m paying a lot of money! You scum, you won’t- ugh, hi arg, na, let go of my hands!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The noble was trying to open up and complain. However, the delinquent was furious, showing an angry face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t think money can get you everything in the world! Even if the previous fucking mafia allowed it, on our watch it is unforgivable. Those who play by the rules and have fun in our town are our customers! All the people who show off their money, break the rules and pollute our town are enemies! That’s our way! The Kamikaze Gang!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Delinquent talked with full confidence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the figure, the Old man whispered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Against the rules… as if there really are any…… I don’t know if they’re just being used by adults without realizing it, but… either way, we have to figure it out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While drifting something meaningful……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ashisotu-san…… Kesu-san…… while you can … get the list of names… Merchants from Japone…… whether the Daimyo are involved or not, gather information…… I’ll see if they really don’t violate the law.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By Your Will”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even if the youth are in charge of the table, it is always adults who are standing behind them. That’s why we really have to find out.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In a whisper, the Old man whispered, and the two men behind him disappeared in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Elder…… are you…… perhaps…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hohoho…… well now? But whatever you find out, don’t tell anyone, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I thought from the Old man’s appearance that he wasn’t just a merchant, but…… before I heard anything, The Old man laughed again and made a deflection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then he slapped me on the back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, that was rather harsh to watch… shall we sit down while we eat?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe the Old man suggested it out of concern for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A little more… I’ll take a look around…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh? Oh I see?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I thought I’d take a closer look.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s a little complicated, but… well, unlike the mafia, if what you’re doing is illegal…… I don’t know what to say to Bro and others, and I don’t have that kind of consensus…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The nobles here. The guys who are working. The monsters that are fighting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Are you all right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, child. A moment ago, who were you looking out for??』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The most complicated thing about the situation is Tre’ainar. I didn’t show it on my face, I smiled and made it look like it’s not a problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t mind, okay? …… I’m here… you can say what you really think”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『A thousand years too early.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good Grief, so stubborn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wanted you to say my real intention a little because I did not understand his words to me, but Tre’ainar laughed through his nose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
