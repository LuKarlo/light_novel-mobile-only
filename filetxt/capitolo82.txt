<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Following Bro, I found a fat man at the restaurant area with about four nasty looking guys standing behind him, gobbling up greasy food.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fat old man looked so pig-like that he could have been mistaken for an Orc.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hid in the shadow of a table on the floor to avoid detection.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro. Are we making a killing, I wonder? I wonder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thanks for coming. Welcome, Minister Chitsue.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The man talked messily while shoving things in his mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was uncomfortable to look at, one of the Imperial Ministers. Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As usual…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve heard rumors. I’m sure. Seems you got the crowd pretty excited. You see. This is one of your virtues. You see.” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Much Thanks”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The working girls too, they don’t seem to be selling their bodies, or getting sick and worn out like they used to, everyone is always healthy and doing well. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sitting in the chair opposite Chitsue, Bro gave a bitter laugh. Apparently, though Bro is being praised, he doesn’t seem to be in a very good mood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just…… some customers are a little disgruntled. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m certain they’re having fun, but the old days were more enthusiastic and exciting… It was. That it was.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Chitsue was smiling at first, but although the smile was on his mouth, only the glint in his eyes became sharp.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In the old days… you mean the days when you could do with the women as you please…… if you ask a merchant, you could get anything, endless gambling and Duel Monsters, a banquet with no rules, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. For the wealthy, using money to break the law gives them a sense of immorality and excitement. You see. For a wholesome gathering like this, you didn’t have to hide your face and play incognito to come to this town. It was. That it was.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The conversation suddenly became suspicious for some reason. What is this guy up to?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care what the customer thinks, the priority is to follow the basic rules. We’ll keep our eyes open to protect this town. Isn’t that our mission, as given by you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro also answered without losing a step with a serious expression as his smile disappeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, as if he had been waiting for those words, Chitsue had a nasty smile on his face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Follow the rules…… but it’s the same for you. You see.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Have a look. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Chitsue threw a bunch of paper at the table.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Information I came across… According to the original rules, merchants and trade associations that bring in auction items are always supposed to come to me to intervene and mediate. They do. There is also a need to conduct a credit check on the merchants. That it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure. That’s why we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But a merchant, whom I didn’t hear of, has been in and out of here and sold items at auction. That it is. In addition, we didn’t have a margin when it came to the sales. That it is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Upon hearing those words, Bro took a piece of paper and looked at it, astonished.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah, that’s ridiculous. We only let in the merchants who properly brokered with you. Besides, you guys get the proceeds from the auction sales as a commission…… I know we don’t do such ‘direct management’…… Hey, auction management……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Bro swiftly looked back at baguette head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? a… ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, baguette head turned pale and immediately began to panic.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Bro, um… I…… um…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you…… no way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does baguette head not have any idea…… no, rather than just happening to know……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It, it’s not like that! I just…… the merchant geezer, who is always taking care of me, asked me to add his friend’s products… he needed a lump sum of money right away, and it would take him a long time to be vetted by the Empire… just because you can trust him… no, I refused at first, but I just couldn’t…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro shut his eyes and slapped himself upon the head at baguette head’s excuses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You didn’t declare it, did you? …… you…… so, you received a stipend, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, n-no way… I, I didn’t receive any.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He hid a violation of the established rules. Baguette head was shaking his head in a panic at Bro’s question whether he got a reward for that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it’s clear from his demeanor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And while watching the situation, Chitsue announced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This merchant…… is in close contact with a dark organization on a different continent… in other words, they are affiliated with the Anti-Imperialist. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Anti, Imperialist!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anti-Imperialist…… That is, an anti-imperial state organization.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re like the Mafia.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What does this mean when His Majesty the Emperor takes the initiative to sever ties between the Empire and the Anti-Imperialist, eradicate the Anti-Imperialist, and cleanse the country?” You see?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s… I never knew it was the Anti-Imperialist at all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu. Now, if you receive money from the Anti-Imperialist, it will be even more problematic. That it would”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At Chitsue’s words, baguette head whole body was trembling and sweating.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He seems to understand the gravity of what he has done.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… you took it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B-Bro…… I…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You took it, didn’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To Bro’s serious question as if he were sure of everything, baguette head resigned himself and gave a feeble nod.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry, Bro… Oh, I… I was suddenly handed the money…… even if I knew it’s no good, it’s just pocket money, so I’m told that it’s okay. So…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~…… ah~… geez.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro sighed as he slipped down, resting his body on the back of the chair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then he lifted his face and asked Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, what do you want me to do? Fire him…… I doubt that’s what you’re here to say.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To answer the question, Chitsue stopped eating and leaned forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly, if this were to be revealed to his Majesty, this gambling house will be done for and your place will be gone. Right.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I don’t want you crushed here, and most of all, I consider you to be family. Ain’t it. You are delinquent and mischievous kids, but I cannot bear to have the adults steal away this garden for that single mistake. Ain’t it. So, as a parent, I’ll take care of it. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather than punishing the hoodlum who broke the rule, Chitsue was trying to do something about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I don’t feel any warmth in Chitsue’s use of the word “family”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, there is a pungently nasty smell floating in the air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But since I, as a father, will go through a lot of trouble to forgive your wrongdoing, I want you all to listen to my little request as a parent. That I do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Look at that. Sure enough, he brought up “exchange conditions”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro also seemed to have anticipated it, and listened quietly without much surprise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the condition that Chitsue brought out……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I would like to loosen some of the rules on this gambling house. That I do. To be precise, concerning the auction and Duel Monster. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At those words, Bro hung his head with a dejected expression that said “I knew it”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, ladies and gentlemen! The first part of today’s Duel Monster is over. Before we commence the second half, we’ll finally start the long-awaited auction!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In front of the cage where beasts were fighting in the center of the gambling den, when a hoodlum raised his voice, the nobles cheered all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you’re excited about the battle between monsters, you can’t be satisfied with that alone. Not just the spectacle. To become the master of monsters, make your monsters fight, raise them up and strengthen them, and go on the road to become a Duel Kings. All for you… the monster auction will start!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Monster Auction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you’ve purchased a monster this time, or if you already own a monster, you can add your monster to the latter part of today’s Duel Monster and fight! To the man who aims to be a Duel King…… if you’re here, come on down!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was exactly what I expected when I heard the Old man’s story.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To become the master of monsters. In other words, an auction to buy monsters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Up first, we have a ferocious carnivore sporting a powerful jaw, as strong as any of the Dragon-kin, that could crunch anything. Can exert its power on both land and water and has a stylish mustache, the Demon Realm Crocodile… I give you, Dandy Croc! Now, the minimum bid starts at 5 million!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “5.5 million!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “6 million!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “6.3 million!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “7 million!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A monster was brought in while being restrained by a collar and a muzzle. The excited nobles stood up all at once, raised their hands, and tried to throw their bid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this is what the ‘auction’ was all about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Chitsue’s request was to revise the rules of the current auction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a matter of fact, in the Imperial Grand Prison that houses criminals…… there are many criminal demons who have sinned on the Surface. Ogres. Dark elves. Devil-kin. Cyclops, minotaurs, vampires, and so on. I want those intelligent demons to be eligible for Duel Monster and auctions. That I do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In addition, it might be interesting to auction female demons as tools for sexual gratification. Why not!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue said, with a smirk and sleazy grin on his face……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm…… My oh my…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though Tre’ainar, who was beside me, did not change his expression, there was anger in the emotions which clearly overflowed from his body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not prisoners of war, but criminals who were arrested for crimes. Originally, they are beings that should be subject to the death penalty, yet taxpayers’ money is invested to maintain the facility they are simply being held in. See. It’s ridiculous. You know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unaware of the Great Demon King’s anger, he began to talk eloquently about things that were outside the law.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Use of intelligent demons is not allowed… either way, if it were found out, the Hero. Hiro won’t stay silent, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, while closing his eyes, Bro replied in a reluctant manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Chitsue talked, without regard to the statement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t have to worry about that anymore. You see. Hero Hiro will soon be stripped of his authority. That he will.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Thanks to what his son did, Hiro has relinquished all his responsibilities. Ain’t it so. No matter how close his Majesty and Hiro may be as the Seven Heroes, they must carry out their responsibilities. See.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the middle of it all, my father and I were brought up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The nobles were talking about it before I came in here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In many ways, it gave me complicated feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a trail, I’d like to use a few demons in the second half of today’s duel monsters. That I do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, wha… from today?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. I do. Don’t be surprised, okay? Gufufufufu, I prepared an outrageous monster for the day.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that, Chitsue turned back to the nasty guys behind him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey. Hey. Bring them in. Come on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Understood”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That being said, one of the men left the place and went somewhere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when Chitsue turned to Bro again……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gufufufufu, look forward to it. I’m sure the customers will love it too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I refuse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that Great Demon King once… eh? hey, huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue leaned forward and made a proposal, but Bro’s words left him wide eyed and surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah, eh… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He didn’t expect to be refused. Bro gave his message with strong eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It was ‘we’ who did wrong. Then, the thing to do is not to ask for forgiveness, but to atone. And if as a result we receive penalties, get fired, or if we lose our place, so be it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I’m the leader. In that case, I’ll accept full responsibility. Be it half my salary or my dismissal…… whether it’s a finger or an arm, take whatever you like. But, I won’t accept the alteration to the rules.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without hesitation, he answered…… a finger?? What is he talking about!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We hoodlums aren’t captives of the common sense and evaluation of society. That is simply the way of life that you guys have decided on abiding. So if you’re going to offer forgiveness for our wrongdoing in exchange for conditions which we don’t want, we may refuse, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, idiot! Do you understand what you’re saying, do you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Idiot? Who are you talking to? I’m sure you’ve figured out that I’m an idiot delinquent, haven’t you? That’s the kind of chap you’ve tried to use.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We will atone for our sins. However, the exchange condition is not acceptable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was such a belief in the man named Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… you’re all going to be fired as joint responsibility, right? Huh? I have that power. Get it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s too bad. But I can’t accept your request.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh, Bro…… You punk.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, of course, it is an adult who will not accept such unfavorable terms obediently.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue raised his hand, and the guys behind him came forward.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, not only them, but also the very crowd of stout and heavy-faced adults who had been placed on the floor of the gambling-house began to gather around Bro all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Chitsue adds a lot of inflections either in the middle or at the end of his dialogues. Words like のか, たい, いる, れる, らな, よう, だね. The meanings don’t really make much sense if directly translated, kinda seem like just random stuff he adds while talking. One of these happen to translate as ‘You See’ which brought to mind 1920s prohibition era Gangsters, so I ended up seeing the guy as a fatter Al Capone and I tried to bring that out. It kinda fits, especially with the secret gambling den being a sort of SpeakEasy Booze Joint. Anyway, let me know if you have any thoughts or inputs on this.
