 “Bro… Don’t get cocky. Just no. Do you know what will happen if you go against adults? Do you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not going against it. I just follow the rules originally set and won’t change them just to fatten you up. I’ll take the punishment for what my people did. That’s fine, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro, who stood up without fear of Chitsue’s intimidation, raised his hands as if to show a pose of surrender.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, his eyes did not seem to have yielded at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hm, hmpf… you punk…… have you forgotten the kindness that gave you a responsible job even as a ‘half-wit’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t forget your gratitude. I’m grateful to you. That’s why…… I’m going to make sure you don’t get any fatter and make your health worse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I will take Full responsibility. So please withdraw your request.” [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The fat pig rose with a snort and a flush of anger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, took a liquor bottle which was on the table, and slammed it down on Bro’s head with great vigor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, B, Bro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ky kyaaaaah!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Bro! Your ‘Cap’!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shattering bottle. Splintering debris. And with that momentum, the hat Bro was wearing flew off… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s this? Is this…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, h-hey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you… Mr. Bro… Wha? Eh? What!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hoodlums were in a panic, calling out “Oh no!” and the guest nobles were astonished to see the “impossible”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m also… the same…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, that’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naa, Tre’ainar… Bro’s head… ears, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked Tre’ainar, but he doesn’t seem to be very surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I once said this about the fellow, did I not? …… ‘Half-wit’……』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was aware from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This incident.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The deep hat concealed Bro’s true identity.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Blue, swept-back hair, all ruffled up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A single ‘horn’ slightly extended from the forehead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, pointed ‘ears’ which are unlike a human’s.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, is that Bro? What does that mean, Bro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, Bro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The customers who were excited by auctions and gambling turned pale all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the hoodlums…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, it… Bro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro! We’ll do something about this! You, just leave okay!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather, why didn’t you avoid it? Why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, calm down, guys! It’s true that Bro is unusual, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This reaction from the delinquents. Yes, the hoodlums ‘knew’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah~, you got… first blood. Well, this is also one of the punishments… I’m willing to accept it. I don’t care what happens to me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While everyone was surprised by Bro laughing like that, Chitsue’s voice echoed throughout the gambling hall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, that’s right! Ladies and gentlemen… This guy, Bro Glenn… who was deceiving our eyes and slipping into human society… is a demon, that it is!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, he is… Human and Demon. A mixed race… that is, half-breed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I got speechless and fell behind at Bro’s true nature, which I hadn’t expected at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The buzzing nobles, who had been talking to Bro earlier in the day in good spirits, were all surprised and backed away, as if they were afraid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Bro who was hit with a liquor bottle, remained dignified and was wiping his wet head and a little blood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wasn’t deceiving or hiding anything. I just wore this hat all the time because I liked it… Besides, and I’m not a human, demon or half-demon.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The identity that you would originally want to hide.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No wonder. Even though the war is over, the current world still doesn’t easily accept variants.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Mr. Aka was hiding in the mountains because he had such a hard time and was aware of it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, a half-demon is neither a full demon nor a full human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why Chitsue and Tre’ainar called him, “Half-wit”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, Bro does not seem particularly perturbed by the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Instead of hiding his strange figure, he opened it up again, and he’s just…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A hoodlum. That’s what I am.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not a human, a demon, or a half-demon. Bro declared his true identity and stuck to it, he considered himself a hoodlum to the end.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro Glenn! I used you although you were a half-demon, but it was convenient because you were adored by the townspeople and the youngsters. That’s all! That all…… that. A little, no, considerably painful experience watching over you and apparently you’re not grateful, you’re not you’re not you’re nooooooot!! My forefathers have contributed to the development of the Empire for generations… Let’s engrave the crime against Chitsue Fauhala in your body!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fauhala… ah…… this fellow, that civil servant… he is a descendant of the one who once plagued the Demon King Army by greatly developing the Empire with his intelligence and political power? I see. I wondered why such a simplistic, weak-headed, unsightly pig was a minister… of course, tis a fine lineage, but the man is merely an incompetent pig that has gained status only through the influence of his ancestors.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar’s said something really harsh, but… that’s not the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever kind of guy Chitsue himself is, his position and those who follow him are real.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You guys, I want this bastard beaten to a pulp no straighten him up dear me dear me dear me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Along with those words, the guys who came along with Chitsue gave a broad grin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re… like bodyguards, yet they’re not warriors… but they don’t seem to be respectable either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… They all… possess some ability. Most likely not warriors… Mercenaries.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Either way, as a Tre’ainar believed, they’re not ordinary guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if all of them were to get involved, Bro would…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, it’s a cheeky fucking brat.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What shall we do with you, scum?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, let’s see how far your brave act goes, shall we?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, dozens of men with bottles, chairs, blunt instruments and so on in their hands were in front of Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Bro is consistently immobile and willing to accept everything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that’s…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””No…… Don’t――― “””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, absolutely do not get involved in this!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I… and the hoodlums were about to jump out, Bro stopped it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is just a distinction. It’s not about hoodlums, half-demon, or an insult to the minister… it was ‘we’ who first broke the rules. I’m not going to waver.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, Bro himself retold the story that was almost forgotten.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, Chitsue isn’t angry about that. He’s angry because the exchange condition he brought forward was refused.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet Bro… said “we”, you didn’t particularly do anything!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No…it, it’s enough already, Bro! It’s me. It’s all my fault! I’ll make amends! I’m going to die! So, please, Minister Chitsue! I’ll get fired, so please let Bro off! I’m begging you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it all started when baguette head violated the rules.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Baguette head sat on the ground crying and begged for forgiveness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But Bro smiled…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkakka, idiot. Fellow friends should be on an impartial and equal standing… But yet, why is there a leader? It is because they sometimes take the lead in a fight and sometimes take the responsibility on their behalf. This is my job. So, I won’t budge!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, Bro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides, it would be sad if you died. So you watch what I’m doing, you hurt in your heart, and you regret breaking the rules. And I swear you’ll never break them again. That’s your distinction. Rather than feeling like you’ve cleared up your sins just by being beat up, it’s much harder, and you’ll never think of doing it again, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment he told the tearful baguette head that, the man in front of him slammed the chair on Bro’s head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t keep playing lame friendship game, brat!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oraa! You said you’ll take responsibility, so let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Te…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re just a piece of trash!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro didn’t avoid them at all. The men mercilessly hit, kick, and beat such a defenseless Bro to their heart’s content.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, stop, stop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn it, damn it!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, please, B, Bro!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hoodlums and the women turned pale. On the other hand, the nobles…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but Bro… no, he’s a half-demon, isn’t he?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right! You were fooling us! This is a fraud!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If I knew he was half-demon, I wouldn’t have been involved!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were trying to justify this scene, something that would otherwise turn eyes away, on the grounds that Bro is a half-demon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, after all, you’re a damn monster! You can only hang with delinquent trash, no matter what you do!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You think you’ll be allowed to act so cool and fight against adults?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, cry, kneel down and apologize!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beating up as they pleased, saying as they pleased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Bro did not refute it at all, and was just standing there accepting the attacks no matter what.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He never fell, never broke, continued to be hit, his face and the body were painfully carved with blood splatter and injuries.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nevertheless…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B…ro…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt a shudder. I didn’t know how to express this feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how much was done, the light in his eyes does not yield to the other party at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro should be much stronger than his opponents, but he was trying to stick it out in order to draw a distinction based on my belief.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This, guy…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve seen, with my own eyes, Bro’s open-minded personality, his fighting skills, and how he’s adored by youth and people in the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, I had the impression that he was “out of the ordinary”, “strong”, “popular” and so on, but that was it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For sure there are others with more unusual personalities, who are much stronger, and more popular than Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this way of life… how things should be… the figure that sticks to his principles to the bitter end, and never shows weakness……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This guy’s… so… Awesome!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A hooligan that can’t be respected. No, whether delinquents, humans, demons, half-demons, and so on… as an individual, it didn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I was unconsciously swayed by that same “man”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is that why it’s enough to just stand there and show this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do I really want to be excluded?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was an outsider, I didn’t want to be unable to do anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child… do not be tactless. Tis stupid and incomprehensible, but… even so, he is fighting in his own way… do you intend to get involved?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I found myself stepping out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar gave a bitter smile at me, but I still…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t care. I’m not one of them, I’m not a delinquent. I’m simply…… going to mess with it because they keep doing unpleasant things as they please right in front of me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fuhahahaha, you disapprove hence you will interfere. The world would call you a hoodlum.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I threw away the goggles I was wearing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My feet didn’t stop any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] The word he uses, which is also the chapter title, ケジメ (kejime), translates directly as Distinction (e.g. between right and wrong). But I can’t help but feel as if this isn’t the authors actually intention but rather is using it as a shorthand for けじめを付ける (kejimeotsukeru), which could mean to make a clear distinction, but also means to take clear responsibility for (mistakes, etc.)​. Which is basically what Bro intends to do, take full responsibility for his underlings’ wrongdoings.
