 He’d never abandon his friends. On top of that, take responsibility for everything yourself and draw the line.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hoodlums are biting their lips with regret at the sight of Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I hate stupid delinquent brats! For your friends? Do you think that cold logic matters to adults?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, adults curse it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I……?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yo… is that…… fun for those who hit and those who get hit?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I walked up to Bro in the middle of being hit and asked, the adults made an expression that said “you’re in the way”, but immediately looked at me and looked surprised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!? Ah, eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you’re…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sure enough, the adults seemed to know me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, it’s more like my title than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been a long time, Minister Chitsue.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…eh? Wh…Why…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About a year since the princess’s birthday party at the Royal Palace.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The face of Chitsue, who was making noise by shouting while looking down at the beaten Bro, was distorted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… trying to drag a pure kid into the delinquent path through smoking or drinking, yet going to the trouble to keep your hands from dyeing off illegal matters… mostly I thought, you’re a terrible guy, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-why… here…… no, you’ve been in this town, Earth!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A few days after leaving home… I never thought you would be the first acquaintance I meet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I laughed bitterly at this strange reunion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, that kid… what’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you know Mr. Chitsue?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 People around me were confused by my sudden appearance, and even the hoodlums asked, “What’s going on?” while upset.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t… ah? …… what are you doing… brother… I said not to put your hand in this, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro asked me, wiping the blood that was dripping.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When did I become one of you? Why should I listen to you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Kakkakka… why, then, you usually shouldn’t interfere, because it’s got nothing to do with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Still, if you keep doing unpleasant things in front of me, I’d get anxious. Don’t do these things in public.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What the hell is that? An irrational argument.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I guess we’re alike in that regard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We began throwing verbal jabs at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for Bro, he would have tried to take responsibility by letting the other party do as they pleased until they were satisfied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I interfered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, don’t ignore me… Earth…… you disappeared in the Commemorative Match before. What are you doing here? Is that it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve done nothing. I just disappeared and selflessly tried to get away from the Empire, and I just got here, and I still… haven’t done anything, and I haven’t accomplished anything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So much non-stop chatter… does Hiro know about this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does my father know? The question made me spontaneously snicker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I didn’t even know why it turned out this way. How would he know?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… eh……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So as for me, I don’t want to get into any weird conflicts, I just want to go to the ends of the world to a distant place where no one knows about me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s it. That’s why I should have just turned a blind eye to all this trouble and left the town.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t do that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But even so, for some reason, I met some guys and got involved with them… this hoodlum is one of them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? …… no way, Earth! You guys…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s not it. I’m not one of them… not a hoodlum… no, I don’t know what kind of reputation I have in the Empire now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wasn’t supposed to be a delinquent. But I left home like this, ignored my parents’ feelings and did whatever I wanted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it may be unavoidable to answer “Yes”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… you made a mess of an Honorable Imperial Match, and for somehow even used a forbidden technique, so there’s nothing but distrust in the Empire! Even if you were found to be with hoodlums, it wouldn’t be surprising!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so… well… I’m prepared for that too… but…… even if he’s not a friend, couldn’t you wait a minute to get this guy out of here before beating him up?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, was that was that tha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We might be similar… but…… still, when I look at the man named Bro, I think, “I’m different”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tell me one thing, Bro.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The way you’re trying to take responsibility… I thought…… you look like an idiot… but I couldn’t take my eyes off it… my heart was shaken… I’ve seen a lot of strong guys, popular guys… you were the first of your type I’ve ever seen.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Knowing what I know about Bro, I had to ask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why are you… in a place like this, smoking out and being a delinquent… under Minister Chitsue? Will you stay a hoodlum forever? Is this what you really want?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why do you live in a town like this, won’t go out to the world, and won’t raise your name?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Being a half demon—“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That has nothing to do with it… it was the reason why I became a hoodlum, but… it’s not the reason why I stay a hoodlum.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before asking if the reason had anything to do with being half-demon, Bro told me to interrupt my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… don’t say I’m smoldering. I’ve been out in the world more than you imagine. It’s not a sunlit world, but well… I’ve been through a lot… I even joined a dojo… that’s why, after various experiences and encounters, I finally gave up and decided that the way I’m living now is better. I chose it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? This…… is it better to live like that, having these guys run all over you? These people can tease you and make fun of you all they want, yet you help the minister make a little money and try to defend them like that! What distinction? Is there a reason to protect this place?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I couldn’t stand it. Not him being Minister Chitsue’s errand boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro… you’re a rare breed… really popular, too. And most of all, a heart that doesn’t bend and doesn’t break. A spirit which tries to take responsibility on your own for your companion, too… as you endured that beat down. I thought it was awesome… but…… that’s why…… at the same time as I thought awesome, I also thought like this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the way of the man named Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Such a waste!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy is stronger than that. When he fights, far from being an Imperial Warrior… Imperial Knight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you put your mind to it… as long as you don’t stick to your hometown and the hoodlums… you’d be more…… more…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t see the depths of his strength yet, but at least, if it’s just combat ability, it’s more than the princess… more than Rebal… more, much more… that’s why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hey… ah… Earth my boy… what are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-That’s right… this is an adult playground, and not a place for little boys, is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, get the hell home now. We’ve got an errand to run on this trash…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the escorts with Chitsue tried to interrupt my conversation with Bro…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get out of my way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Triple jab. I smashed all the alcohol bottles, chairs, and blunt instruments that the men had with my fists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah … ah … oh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, it’s…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th-This kid…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The three of them couldn’t react to my left at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Bro, who was being beat up by these guys as much as they wanted until a while ago, wasn’t agitated at all when he fought me during the day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re much stronger than these guys, Bro! What’s the point of staying a delinquent forever?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro is much stronger than these guys.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I couldn’t watch it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Bro…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My bad… this way of life has already become like breathing… that’s why we can’t go back.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re a different race from yours… different race… so, the culture and ideas are different… My bad. I’ve also wanted to get somebody to understand it, so I can’t think of an explanation that you’ll be satisfied with, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Though you’ve become familiar with me, when I come to yourself, you refuse.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, to begin with, I’m not great enough to get involved in people’s lives and how they live, nor do I know anything about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Surely you’re stubborn… but these days, I can understand an ogre if we talk, but… you I don’t understand, no matter how much I talk with you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakakka, that can’t be cured.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I really don’t understand… I can’t do anything about it… but… I wonder why… I don’t know what’s bothering me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Minister Chitsue…… you’ve been greatly troubled too, because you’ve hired these guys…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, Nunu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So? What are you going to do? This guy has taken responsibility as it is, are you going to beat him up some more?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, with a look of disgust, I sighed and spoke to Minister Chitsue, who was still shaken
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you going to continue with that matter from earlier?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Are you going to force them to do what they know is illegal?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmph. Earth…… I don’t know what your relationship is with Bro, but you know I’m… no, you don’t think I’m going to back out for fear of you… or your parents, do you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While sweating, he smiled with a somewhat gut-wrenching grin…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you were to report my story earlier… no one would believe what you have to say anymore, just like the delinquents in this town. Rather, as a minister, I am the one who will have the last word…’Earth has gone down the path of evil’. Speaking of, if it is now, the Imperial Capital should believe it! Then there’s nothing to fear you, you see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Chitsue raised his hand and turned to all the guards with him…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All these miscreants who stand in my way will be hurt toge――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Giiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the minister, but we could hear screams that we didn’t even expect…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hi, hii! H- Help… save, me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the room at the back of the gambling hall, one of the escorts, covered in the blood, came out crawling… what?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Huh? What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both Bro and I looked at each other, but neither of us knew what was going on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I saw the figure of the wounded man who was crawling out of the room, I realized something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the man who went somewhere under Chitsue’s order…… the man who was told to ‘bring something’…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”……Ah……””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Bro and I noticed at the same time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………… KIIIILL…… HUUMAAANSS…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A chilling voice came out from the back of the room, collecting miasma.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that shadow was not alone.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
