<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With the screams of the bloodied man, shadows wriggled in the darkness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The size of the shadows varied. Some have a physique no different from ours, while others are obviously several times larger.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in some places, the shapes of the shadows were different from humans. One of these entities, who gives off a strange ambiance, stepped into the gambling hall, raised its huge arm, and tried to swing it down at the crawling man, and at the same time revealed its full figure… Before that!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey there!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, if such an unexpected event happens, you can’t move immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, what was about to come out of the back room was something that was obviously not human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the very least, I observed it, thinking about what to do.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But he was different.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He slipped in-between them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sense. A wild feeling. As if instinct had detected it, he moved faster than anyone else, hitting a huge arm that was swung down with a kick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh~, wh-what… this guy… so cool…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, everyone was amazed at the sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Free…kill…you…I’ll kill you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The girth was about two times bigger than that of a normal person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Its whole body was covered in green skin, the hands were sharp sickle-like arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The expression, completely different from that of a human being, was that of an insect.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A… Praying Mantis?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This thing… a giant human-shaped mantis. Mantis race!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a monster that I’ve only seen in picture books.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A race that is extremely ferocious and has been designated as a dangerous species.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s going on? Why is that bug loose, darn it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue was panicking at the unexpected. Then, upon closer inspection, Mantis’s ankle was dragging along broken chains and shackles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, what that monster… n-no way…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Run away, Hi, Hi…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, Chitsue escaped from what he brought.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the guests understood that, everyone turned pale and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Cursed humans. I’ll have you clear away my grudges!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, nu!? Oh crap!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at some point, someone jumped into Bro’s bosom as he held back Mantis’s arm, and stabbed at him with the broken liquor bottle in their hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez… what now… whoa?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro, who jumped away in the nick of time, took a distance with the crawling man being held in his arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the person who tried to stab Bro raised their face, and we were once again shocked by their appearance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, woman?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, she was a woman. But she’s not just a woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Brown skin. The voluptuous body which could easily charm men was covered with a tattered long skirt and a short shirt which stopped at her navel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Her long purple hair was damaged from being restrained for so long, but it doesn’t detract from the woman’s beauty.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the ears protruding from under the long hair proved that the woman was not human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dark Elf… hey, come on, are you serious?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s a dark elf. I’m seeing one for the first time, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uga, kill… Uga, eat… raid”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although not as much as the Mantis, it is the first demon that appeared with a massive, muscular body. A Cyclops.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gigigigigi, Gi, Gii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A small demon appeared from underneath the cyclops’ feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goblin…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Four demons who appeared were released from their restraints.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What’s up with these guys? Why are they suddenly showing up?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm…… Ho~』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seems that Chitsue brought them in, but apparently they saw an opening and broke out of the restraints.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before we could figure out who they were and what circumstances they were under…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you guys! Hurry up and get all the guests outta here! I’ll hold these guys off, but if they’re about to go outside, fight your guts out! When our hometown is threatened, we hoodlums start moving first! Now is the time to show what we’re all about, yeh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ah……””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rather than thinking, run, risk it all, fight and protect!! That’s it!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh, o, ohh!!!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the midst of the four demons who appeared, Bro spoke up first and issued instructions to the hoodlums.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Too simple an instruction. “Run”, “Risk it all”, “Fight”, “Protect”, that’s all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t panic, run away, guests!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, I’ll get caught!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Have you lost your legs? Shut up and get on my back!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They’re on the move? The delinquents who should have turned pale together with the guests started moving at Bro’s simple instructions, screaming out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, aaah… they guys… even though they’re scared…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm… tis why they are hoodlums…… because they are emotional, quick handed, and simple-minded folk… actually there are times when such is indispensable…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though I was shocked by the four demons who showed up, I couldn’t help but fall behind the other hoodlums, let alone Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time, I felt a little miserable, but I was amazed at the hoodlums and laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I won’t let you get away! Everyone here dies!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let me do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh… Devil-kin… No, half-breed…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong. I’m just a hoodlum.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Dark Elf started running to attack the fleeing guests.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro intercepted her front so as to block the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dark elf is a woman, but she glared at Bro with sharp eyes and clicked her tongue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh……… don’t let the half-breed get in our way. Humans… and I’ll kill that coward pig most horribly.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Dark Elf looked at Chitsue with a murderous eye.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what are you on about, you are all criminals… a-and what’s the attitude when I kept you alive instead of the death penalty, see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue drew back, and shouted in a trembling voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hunting in a forbidden area on human territory… ‘The female Dark elf poacher, Skevern’… the same is true for others! ‘The Assailant Cyclops, Bowei’……’The Goblin Potato Thief, Yasashi‘……’The Escaped Pet Mantis, Toulowe’! No, I’ve kept you all alive and you’ve forgotten what I’ve done for you, what’s the meaning of this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue shouted out the names and charges of the four who aren’t even of the same tribe, much less human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was a little concerned about the charges, but rather than a debt of gratitude, at the very least the other party seemed to harbor a grudge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “There’s no balance between the crime and the punishment I’ve tasted. Do you know what I suffered in the women’s prison because I’m a demon? Generally, poaching? Such foolishness. That mountain was originally home to our village … and it was overrun by the filthy Imperial Army!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to such a crime, the dark elf shouted, “It’s not worth it” and turned her murderous intent on him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the way…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even so, if you walk that road, you’ll end up in ruin… even if you don’t get your money’s worth, even if you have feelings that you can’t give up… it’s just a grudge, sister.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it must be fate that we met like this. It’s been a long time, in that case as much as you want … I’ll take everything you’re feeling. That should make you feel better.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro forced his way through, and received them, such a situation was really bothersome.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kill… kill… kill!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, against Bro, who deals with a beautiful woman even if she is a criminal, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh… as for me…… it’s a miss, isn’t it? The most troublesome one is here, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, child… In a sense, tis a win.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Mantis, who started running, swung its sickle-like arms.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tte, not good, you! Get out of here, I’ll take them all together…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So why should I listen to you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That thing would instantly split a living person in two if they received them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The blade was turned to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, they are trying to kill humans indiscriminately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, calm down…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash!! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it made too big a swing, I easily plunged into the inside of its bosom, and hit the body with a blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis’s big body trembled due to my fist and it retreated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… Toulowe!? What’s with that human brat!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey hey, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dark elf and Bro show a look of surprise at my side spear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keh… after all, I don’t get it… hoodlums…… what’s more, Bro… you’re going to put your body up and save the people who were talking sh*t about you… I really don’t understand… really…… what the hell is wrong with you……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While muttering that, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But don’t get me wrong. I don’t care what happens to this place. Be it hoodlums, ministers, distinctions, you can do whatever you want.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s just… this mantis attacked me, an unrelated person. In other words, it’s my enemy. The enemy of the enemy is an ally… is there a problem with that logic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I couldn’t change Bro’s mind, and I can’t say anything more about the responsibility he is trying to carry, or this gambling house or the delinquency.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is the least I can do…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka, no… I don’t have any objections with this, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I’ll take care of this one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… In that case… I’ll leave it to you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro smiled at my words, and turned to face the dark elf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re a dependable guy, man. It’s reassuring to have you fighting with me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. I see. Well, I’ve had enough of that… Even if I don’t understand them, I want to get to know them as well… and in order to know them, we’ll either fight each other or fight together. that’s the most obvious thing, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re so weird, brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As we turned our backs to each other, and facing each other’s enemies, we laughed at each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now… Mantis… if you have a lot of resentment for that minister and other humans, I’ll play with you. I’m not gentle, but I’m the kind of guy who can play with demons.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’ve got a restless, savage Mantis…What?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Brat… prepare… get, serious, kill.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis, who had been attacked by me, became meek and calm as he poised me with its eyes like a hunter coolly targeting his prey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Caution, child. This Mantis… tis no mere Mantis. It seems to have mastered a Martial Art unique to the mantis race.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As such, tis a win. Tis quite rare to get a chance to challenge this Fighting Style.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis’ unique fighting style? It’s the first time I’ve heard of such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Praying Mantis(Tower Climbing)Demon Fist(Cursed sword)…… show you”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the Mantis bent a little and spread its legs wide, showing a unique stance with both sickles hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, it’s the first time I’m seeing it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I’ll…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I’ll play using the fists of the Demon King who once ruled your world.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also made a fighting pose to fully enjoy it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The English phrase for Praying Mantis Style is Mantis Boxing. If you hear the word ‘Mantis’ and associate it with unpleasant words, I won’t be offended and you can come back later to report it.
