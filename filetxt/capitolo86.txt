<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis, who clearly showed a ‘Martial Arts’ stance, was obviously not a wild beast that lashes out on instinct. It felt calm and lacked openings like a martial artist… well, it’s originally an insect rather than a beast, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, because of that, I easily avoided a large swinging attack and jumped into the pocket a little while ago, but it was different now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh… I haven’t done anything yet, and just by looking at your stance, I’m a little hesitant to attack you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The reach of those long sickle-like arms was much too different to wait and see with the left flicker.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I would have to dive under those arms to hit my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis, on the other hand, remained quietly poised and didn’t seem to be making any moves from the other side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, are you just going to keep staring at me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But that’s not something my master can forgive.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of course.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as I answered my words in my heart, I had no choice but to make the first move.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, in-fighting by dodging the opponent’s attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, I better not defend with the head-butt as in Mr. Aka’s case when facing that sickle.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, minutely swinging the head, lean forward and jump in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! 【Great Demon Goosestep】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Koi”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, in a straight line. There, Mantis’s reaction was slightly displaced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And from the middle distance, with both eyes open, that sickle…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Won’t let”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just then, Mantis’ outstretched arm was swung at my leg… hey, long! If the arm is extended, it’s longer than expected!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, it tried to get at my feet as I stepped in … not good, if it hits. Because this is a sickle, so if it hits…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Soiya!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had no choice but to jump and avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, at the moment I flew, Mantis’ other arm was thrust out, and the sharp tip of the sickle was… aiming at my eyeballs…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey just!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiiiii!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sickle was thrust out with a strange Mantis call.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Quickly, while in the air, I twisted and spun my whole body. However, I couldn’t avoid it. Hot, it hurt, my head, face? What about the eyes? Eyes……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bastard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can’t open my eyes? Blood? Were they crushed? My eyeballs?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I performed an Ukemi landing and hit my back, but the premonition that the eyeballs may have been crushed sent a strong chill down my spine. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho~… s, safe…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, I cut my eyelids a little. Because I got blood in my eyes, I couldn’t open it for a moment. But there’s no problem with the eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, as relieved as I was, my tension increased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He, hee, bastard… really…… you suddenly go for your opponent’s eyeballs in battle?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… to avoid…… even so, capable.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opponent’s vital point. Of course there are things like the eyeballs, or if you’re a man, the n●thers. but I don’t have the ‘nerve’ to attack them with all my might. I’d hesitate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fool. Your peripheral field of view is narrow. Do you think your opponent is merely a larger humanoid? The arms are shaped and jointed differently. If you make a wrong assumption, you will get hurt, will you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And this is true Martial Arts. Relentlessly aiming at the vital point of the human body and surely dispatching the opponent… The art of killing. To ruthlessly exploit your opponent’s weaknesses and execute them… tis not a fight, you are killing each other.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar points out my naivety due to my motivation for a fight. Sure, the opponent was cool and didn’t seem up for a very violent fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Are you ready? The Mantis’ fighting ability is among the highest of all races.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiiiiii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sure, I’m still receiving advice from beyond!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While I was still in the middle of listening to Tre’ainar, this time Mantis stepped in towards me, and it’s absurdly fast!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sickle was swung down. That was a close one, too. If I didn’t take half a step back, deep cut. He was aiming at my neck. However, a second and third blow came even during such a horrifying situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The body suitable for combat. The speed to find prey and jump in…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good, I couldn’t get a counter. I could only dodge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And, the strength to sustain that super speed and hold the prey once caught, and never to let go… the jaw that bites the prey…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, do, don’t push it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The straight line movement is troublesome. Then, I’ll lead it around with my footwork.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the blind spot, as if drawing a circle around it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See you”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I tried to turn left and right, it moved its head in response to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Can you see my movements?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, it can. That field of view completely captures the surroundings.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is Mantis. Speed. Strength. Wide field of view. In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Furthermore, this Mantis has mastered the Praying Mantis Demon Fist.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, that’s usually a miss!!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I want to scream “It’s a Miss”. I mean, this Mantis is preposterously strong, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is why tis a win, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『And, from now on, I shall give you rules, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I shouted my complaint, Tre’ainar smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In this battle… the 【Great Magic Spiral】, the 【Breakthrough】, and all other magic are prohibited.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, wh-what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Overwhelm that Mantis with your living flesh.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even at the best of times, I would consider myself in a pinch, yet he made an unreasonable demand on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No way, I was thinking of using the Breakthrough normally from now on, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, n, no matter what happens?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s too harsh. That’s what I was going to say, but Tre’ainar had a serious expression…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You exchanged blows head-on with that extremely capable ogre. And this time, you can fight the Mantis, who has excellent overall strength and killing prowess. You can get a great deal of experience here before you leave the Empire and set out into the world.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The World…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, child. Do not become a delinquent that stays in your hometown forever. Surpass this Mantis, take the step to the next level, and then go to the world!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Come now, not only advice, but also words that inspire me. Really, my master is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『To that end, take advantage of this precious opportunity. Not to defeat the opponent, but to bring out all from the opponent, and then see everything with your own eyes, and then win. You can do it.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… can…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s strange. That was the most powerful thing I’ve ever heard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those words were the best… I shouldn’t worry about doing it!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Right! Focus! Come on, praying mantis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… loud… cocky… but…… child sure gutsy”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At my cry, Mantis … did you laugh a little? It felt like it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’m more focused than that now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here I go”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An instant dive. It’s fast after all. And from here, it used a sickle to launch an irregular attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is a little different from the two sword style of swordsmanship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only does it slash with the sickle, but it also goes for grabs and pierces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, it is not possible to block it. It’ll cut through the guarding arm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, it is possible to dodge it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Use the upper body deflection such as the sway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Avoid skillful… Good eyes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, even if you praise me all of a sudden, I’ll only give you a fist!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Avoidance by anticipating with Mantis’ arm shape and reach in mind. However, it is troublesome because it’s just fast and it even made irregular attack patterns.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, if you can get through it, you can jump into the pocket…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I finally reached his pocket through a sickle storm, and from there I threw the upper that thrusts the opponent’s chin in one fell swoop.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pusha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not just the upper. I’ll beat you as much as I can right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Hook】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Byab!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I could still go on. No, better yet, it’s a series of hits!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Rush】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goh?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uruaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh! At this rate, you’re going down!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The wall of fists. From the top, below, left and right at high speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar told me to pull out the opponent’s strength, but it doesn’t matter if it gets decided here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Angle, power, the response I got…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hurts”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Mantis’ neck, which had been receiving my rush, was turned towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not very effective!? No, on the contrary, not good!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Catch you”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah, geh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It held me tightly with both hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Too close!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Held by the sickle arm, the protrusion of the saw-like arms bit into the skin, stabbing in, and I couldn’t peel off the strong arm force!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu, Y, you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At this rate I eat”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sharp jaw opens. Bite? No, it’s on the level of chewing… I’m going to be eaten!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guaaaah! Gu, y, you! tsu, Guaaaah!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neck? No, shoulder flesh. Just ahead of the head, I somehow moved my shoulder… but it really bit me!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so hot that my shoulders burn! Ouch!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not struggle, die”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, tsu, hey! Gu, oh… Gu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, the flesh of the shoulder on the other side… Just… is the fellow serious?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Die”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both shoulders were hot. Blood gushed out. The pain is… quite…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, bastard…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “End, Next Die “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, far from biting, it’s the first time I’ve experienced being eaten. What’s more, Mantis…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is bad, bite again… breakthrough, no. It’s not good.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, but if I follow those rules…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So…… Break the rules?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s not the kind of thing you should trade your life for.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, now is not the time to follow such discipline.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure he’ll forgive me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tch… damn…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why, at a time like this… do I remember Bro being beat up?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not a delinquent, but… for some reason… not a rule that someone else decided on their own… if I break the rule I agreed to… somehow…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shaaaahh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It felt like I’m losing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Aah, I don’t want to lose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hoodlums… Bro… and… he said, ‘I can do it’, and I don’t want them to be disappointed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, when I thought so, Mantis’ fangs, trying to bite me with a large jaw open in front of me, looked in slow motion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this what it’s like on the verge of entering a runaway of death? No, it’s not. There was no mystery or fear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? Someone’s voice this time? Whose… Hmm? Somehow, a masked woman ran over here with a Kunai… Hey, you… What are you…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “――――ney”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What do you say, “Honey? Who’s Honey? I mean, why are you in a place like this, no way, hey is this fellow… trying to help me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tch.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, I clicked my tongue. What the hell. I dared to battle in high spirits with the intention of fighting, and I got in a pinch enough for a woman to rush in to try to help me?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t be silly. Don’t look down on me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might lose.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once I’ve decided on the rules, I won’t break them!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…so funny!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Take a look at it. I seemed to be completely held, but there is quite a bit of space and freedom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It is different from the joint technique between humans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Originally, Mantis’ body was not supposed to be human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t pull the hold off, but I can stretch my hands.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I’ll throw my fist. Where? Belly? Face? Centerpiece? Mouth? No, more like…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ohhhhh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hebu’!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Mantis stuck out its face and was about to bite my head off, I gave it a short upper at the boundary between the head and chest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~. Not a bad point to focus your attention, child. Mantis…… Rather, the praying mantis has the feature of being able to move its head at a wide angle. However, because of that, the boundary between the head and chest is made softer.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a counter to someone who has opened their mouth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the structure was different from ordinary humans…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ga, Kak… brat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It worked better than expected. Mantis broke free of my restraints and retreated back to escape and keep his distance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~, hah~… Hey, whoever you are… don’t put your hands on this, okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I said that, while in a Kunai throwing stance, that fellow… Shinobu froze.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho, honey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry to have worried you, but… I, too. I want to stick to the rules that I decided once I agreed to it. I’m not a hoodlum, and I’m not going to be a hoodlum… I don’t want to lose to a hoodlum.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. As long as Bro was living like that, I didn’t want to lose either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I will stick through that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Also……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Somehow, right now… I’m feeling pretty good. So…… why don’t you just relax and watch?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… da, dazzling… ah, it’s so lovely…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I fell into a strange feeling a little while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, at the verge of death, the world seemed like in slow motion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then what was that about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, let’s keep going, Mantis. Come on, it’s the second round! Or did you get scared, Gora!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, fear and tension disappeared, and I was rather excited and itching to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To me who is in such a condition…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fu, fufufu… tis pretty simple when it comes to the master’s satisfaction, tis quite adorable… child……go ‘in’.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As if to say whatever he wanted, Tre’ainar was laughing in good spirits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Brat… cheeky.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis, who once distanced itself from me, also fell for my provocation and attacked.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiii! Hai hai hai hai, haiiiiiii!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wild strikes that combined thrusts and slashes. They were unleashed from various angles, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, if I don’t get so confused by tricky movements… it’s slower than Rebal.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re not nearly as powerful as Mr. Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My mind was clear and things were going as I imagined them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even the fast, tricky, and unknown attacks that tossed me up to a while ago, I could read up to two or three moves ahead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, my body also moved as I imagined, and became even sharper.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder what it is, this feeling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a little different from the breakthrough, but now I felt like everything went the way I wanted it to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t feel like hitting anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What are you doing, Toulowe, Skevern! Now it’s better to flee than seek revenge! We’re going to get out of here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, then I heard an unscrupulous voice.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the cyclops that released from its restraint with these guys… What was it again?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll knock you out, kid! This is justifiable self-defens ――――peh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re in the way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Cyclops suddenly tried to attack me from behind in order to get rid of me, but I already understood the movement completely.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I noticed it, I turned around and released a jab, struck out the jaw of the muscular cyclops, and it dropped to its knee on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Wha…eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bowei! Brat…… sudden motion…… how?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The collapsed cyclops’ whole body started to twitch, and seemed unable to move properly, so it couldn’t stand up immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And looked up at me with puzzled eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was elated and said to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, do you want to escape? I’m generous so you’re free to do so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Mantis began to quiver at my remark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Noisy… human… humans… all… die.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Human… won’t forgive”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anger? No, this is… hatred? A grudge?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, that’s not good. He’s probably going to give his backstory, isn’t he?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… when young above ground…… caught… coward trap…… caught… Rich Buy…… for sport…… torment…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 See! Seeee! Seeeeee!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Escape. But caught again. Many people surround. Put in jail. Torment again. You not mock. For all that For all that For all that! So, Human die!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first it was fierce, but then it was a cool killer, and now this… what… highly emotional Mantis, isn’t it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Although……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that has ――――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had nothing to do with me, and I knew that… I tried to say it, but the words failed me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because…… somehow, thanks to the needless speech… I remembered… those words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ――Earth is… small, but…… after all…… so great, so amazing…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It would ruin the words that were said at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Heh…such a thing! It’s okay. I won’t say that… Mr. Aka.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that situation, I wouldn’t be able to face Mr. Aka.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I swallowed the words that came to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t… apologize for your past… and even though I was born in the Imperial City and grew up in the Imperial City… still, I don’t have the power to do anything about the adults who built the Empire today… but…… at least…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Brat?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The clothes are bloody, okay? Even if I take them off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I took off my shirt and pulled out my trouser pockets to show that there’s nothing in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At least I… I’ll fight without traps, weapons, magic, let alone someone else’s help. I’ll take your rampage and anxiety in a fair and forceful manner, Mantis!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, that’s when I finally realized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah… is that right? That’s why he… Bro… put his body up like this… I did the same thing to Mr. Aka at that time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only this Mantis. That dark elf too, she feels the same about human beings… About the Empire… so, surely this cyclops… and the goblin… hmm? Where’s the goblin?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Mantis…… wrong. Tribe Name”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… Toulowe … name, that is.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that was the time. Mantis said his name to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not the name of the race, it’s just as if you were telling me to say your name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why, as a courtesy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth. That’s my name.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… remember”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I gave my name too. And then we set up each other again…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go. This time, it’s the gong of the final round. Come on, Toulowe!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Koi, Earth”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We went out to fight each other.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
