<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mantis…… No, Toulowe’s thrust was unleashed with terrible instantaneous power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sharp blade swung and missed, only the sound of it cutting the air was heard, and a vacuum wave flew.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you can do it in succession, it’ll be a complete storm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiiii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eto”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I avoided it by just a skin’s depth, and I also increased the speed while throwing a series of left hits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Avoid Toulowe’s attack, keep an eye out, find an opening on it, and thrust my right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For that purpose, I can’t stop my hands and feet… I guess that’s the theory, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh… Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m flesh and blood. A single hit would be fatal. Death may be a matter of course.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t underestimate such a thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t let my guard down in the slightest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The task wore down each and every nerve.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I wonder why…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey! Don’t stop, you have to use your feet more, or you’ll get caught again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before I knew it, I stopped dead in my tracks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe’s sickle, which accelerated further, attacked me, and Shinobu’s voice echoed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But. I stopped deliberately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… dear…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wh, what’s going on? Toulowe…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Were Bro and the Dark Elf staring at this fight before they knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, the dark elf was sitting on the floor as if exhausted, did they have a fight?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Toulowe’s attacks… steadily accelerated faster… but… not a single blow…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The cyclops was in a dumbfounded state. Apparently, the people around me have turned their attention to this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… not hit…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe blurted out as he unleashed a fierce slash.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, even if I stopped, I didn’t eat Toulowe’s sickle any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Flicker】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh, tsu, this!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how sharp a sickle or sword is, there is a ‘bulge’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If you hit your fist directly against the blade, you will hurt your fist, but if you hit the ‘bulge’, there is no problem.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, I used the flicker to hit the ‘blade bulge’ as the blade that was swung down or thrust out, and knocked it off.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho, Honey … is dispelling that Mantis demon fist … with one hand …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, I can see the trajectory perfectly now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You have come… to ‘Enter’…the ‘Zone’… at that time, the battle against the Second Sword Saint is being reenacted… to repeat at this level once more…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the voice of Tre’ainar, who seemed to be in a good mood, reached my ear. Well, that’s far from the point. Don’t let your guard down. Focus, concentrate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dynamic visual acuity … Peripheral vision … and…… the fight with Aka, and it bloomed at the end of this battle… ‘Spatial Awareness’… to grasp the existence around oneself… everything from the speed, size and even the sense of distance… so long as you enter the extreme concentration state of the Zone … child … no one will be able to catch you anymore!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not simply going to ward it off any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment Toulowe attacked and tried to pull his arm back, I will inconspicuously dive in all at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A huge and strong body. Half-hearted blows will not work. Earlier, I did damage by aiming at the neck, but Toulowe was also quick to guard against that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I had to aim for another point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now that everything looked slow, my field of view is wide, and my concentration has increased, I realized that looking closely at Toulowe’s body, there’s a spot where I can hit as much as I want.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gieeeh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fugi!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the ‘joint’ of the foot. It seems that the joints are the only part of the body that can’t be trained.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Under normal circumstances, the joints of Toulowe’s legs, which are much larger than mine, are at a position where it’s easier to aim and strike at than a body blow against a human.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I punched him, a distorted voice leaked out of Toulowe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong? Your leg is twitching like a newborn foal! Are you giving up? Is that the best you got?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “eh…… shut up! Not yet!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I agitated him, Toulowe, who was about to collapse for a moment, raised his sickle with an uppercut from below.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sickle passed by my face, as I dodged at the last minute with the sway.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, that’s right! It’s not over yet!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My legs stopped. But my hands haven’t stopped yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first he was puzzled by me, but again, Toulowe’s fighting spirit was ignited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How many days?” How many months? How many years? How much has it accumulated?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haiiii!” Hai hai hai hai hai hai hai!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t put it in words, just let it out!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Noisy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s no point hitting someone who has lost the will to fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if he’s still giving his best… if he hasn’t burned out yet… I’ll fan that spark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, push luck!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ah, did I push it too far? When he jumped into my pocket, I thought it was an upper with the left sickle, but as I was focusing on the bottom and he actually tried to swing his right down from above.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If that was the case, it will hit. But if I jump now, I could avoid it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…… even if I charge in like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Cork Screw Blow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bpupu!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I rushed in regardless, and threw a right cork screw to Toulowe’s body. A half-hearted punch won’t work, so add a twist to increase the penetrating power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, blood spilled out from my face …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte~… you cut me… but, shallow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “you… on purpose…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe’s sickle slashed my cheek. But after all, it’s just the cheek. It hurts, but it’s not a fatal wound.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rather, it was more of a risk to jump in haphazardly and lose my stance for fear of being injured.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wouldn’t have thought or calculated like this before… but today my head is buzzing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, how’s that? Manly, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… if a man is afraid of one or two injuries… how can he go out into the world?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, because it jumped in without fear of the injury, Toulowe’s body wobbled for a moment by the blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now was the time to strike.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So~~~~reeeee!! 【Great Demon Rush】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The high-speed rush of lefts and rights were beat into the body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe’s weak point might be his neck, but I don’t have to aim for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Already in the fight against Toulowe, he was struck with a smash, corkscrew and body blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, with this barrage of hits…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… Gah, Gu, same point…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, don’t just hit the body. Focus on the same points that I’ve hit so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That way, the accumulated punches…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll blow a hole in You!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Picuaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… oh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Toulowe finally jumped back, and retreated with some distance from me to escape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, he still had enough legs to jump?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gih… gugi. brat…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… heh, you’re looking down on me just because I’m a kid, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe stared at me like he’s grinding his teeth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he was unlikely to let the momentum get the better of him and jump on me again or anything.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Toulowe’s legs seemed to have already reached their limits.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He was beaten with my fist, his body was hurt and his movement was already dull.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fu, ha, fuhahahahahah, g-good, Earth, that’s right, viciously beat that bug and capture it right away, that it is!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …just as I was feeling better, a pig’s hoarse voice sounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H-Here, if you do the credit for saving me and catching the bug, I’ll do you the favor of permitting you in the Imperial City again ――――.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up, damn piiiiiiiig!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I said that. I shouted a foul-mouthed word at the Minister from a prestigious family.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “P, Pig… pig?! Wh, who are…? Earth! You sh*t, w-who the hell, who are you talking about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Shut it! Me… this guy and… it doesn’t matter if you’re human, demon, or hoodlum, we all speak the common language called ‘fighting’… don’t interrupt with your pig language.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, you’re a nuisance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We’re clashing with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I won’t let anyone interfere with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Human too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… see as pig?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Toulowe asked me so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thinking a little bit about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… no, maybe it’s disrespectful to pigs, right? Pigs are really smart creatures.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I see… Earth…… violent but… amusing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, is that so… hey, wait a minute! V-Violent, you cut me, bit my shoulder, you’ve gone beyond violent and into savage, you know!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong. Earth scary”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha… haha…… geez… don’t lose focus and chat in the middle of a fight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I also felt relaxed for a moment and smiled bitterly at the friendly conversation between the acts of the fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I wonder if it’s the same with Toulowe, as a somewhat subtle atmosphere flowed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But we still have to settle this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, it’s not over yet. Even Toulowe hasn’t gone all out yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I catch… you okay…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… So…… don’t say things like that in the middle of a fight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… catch… can agree…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He felt a little eager to die.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Toulowe… it may be cheesy, but I sympathize with your situation… it was bad luck to be caught and spotted by the minister… that’s why he’s special, not everyone in the Empire is like that… oh, I can’t tell you what I am… I am me, and I left the Imperial Capital because I couldn’t stand a lot of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Earth too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… I can’t say I’m going to save you… can’t tell you that I’m going to let you get out of here and take you to the Demon Realm… I can’t change anything right now. But…… so the least I can do now… is put my body on the line and get along with you… all the way to the end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… understand”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no matter what happens, there is no objection to the fight now on either side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is my strongest blow”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Toulowe opened his legs wide and was poised. With trembling feet, you can’t jump in, but you can firmly support your body.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Without taking a step back, he took a stance as if to intercept me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, I’m the one who should come first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, I also launch the strongest blow which jumps in without fearing for injury or life.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go! 【Great Demon Jolt Blow】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like throwing yourself out, a full swing with the power and weight of the whole body!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Praying Mantis Demolition Fist】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was intercepted, with all his might, Toulowe put his strength into one mid-level thrust.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike previous high-speed attacks, he focused his strength on a single point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The thrust deeply dug into my side as I jumped in…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bhugug!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By that amount, my Jolt pierced the same point even deeper, without an inch of difference …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Pu, pu… oof.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Finally, my knee completely collapsed and Toulowe went down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Toulowe…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… not win… enough…………… give up…… Earth strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, that was all he said, and fell down on the spot with a thud.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Like that, my rival…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m the one… who is grateful… thanks to you… I will move on to the next stage.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I expressed gratitude for my growth and declared that I would move forward.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
