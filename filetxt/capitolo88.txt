<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the excitement of the battle, there isn’t much pain. The fangs were thrust into both shoulders, the side was gouged, and warm blood was felt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, the aftertaste of the victory that I earned was greater.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The woman who watched over me like that… well, it’s Shinobu, but she came running up to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re overdoing it again… seriously, you’re like that red Oni… I’ll treat you right now…but it’s so cool…your bare bloodstained body, a really nice treat, thank you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu ran up to me with an angry, excited attitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But before I get that treatment first…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu…… treat Toulowe.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Yes?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ea…… Earth?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I asked her to give Toulowe treatment, who still couldn’t stand up, rather than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both Shinobu and Toulowe seemed to be surprised at my words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… what are you…with how much this Mantis has done to you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, that’s okay, isn’t it? My fight with this guy is over already… I don’t want to deal with future consequences.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… please …… Shinobu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seemed a little hesitant, but when I bowed my head down, Shinobu suddenly started to flutter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~… that’s terrible, you… taking advantage of my weakness… I realized that it’s true that the one who falls in love first loses.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…I-Is that so…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, you could at least respond to the exchange diary in earnest.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Shinobu walked over to Toulowe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, she said some things that were too straightforward for me to react to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m so embarrassed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 First of all, I left Shinobu alone, and when I looked back, I found Bro and the Dark Elf, both of whom seemed to have already settled the matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, good work, brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t screw around. Who’s a brother? Like I’d want a dumb big brother I can’t understand.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkakka, don’t be like that~. But it was a good fight. I just want us to exchange a sibling’s cup.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Humph, you must be joking.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed he had a good in its own right, and Bro was smiling, though he was injured. Well, Chitsue’s escorts originally attacked him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the somewhat sullen-looking Dark Elf sat down upon the floor with a sigh.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What a mess… I thought I’d go back to the Demon Realm after rampaging as much as revenge on humans, this mess… quickly, kill me, violate me, do as you please, it’s fine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey hey, don’t carelessly say things like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, that was a pretty cool fight, even for a girl.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…tch … what are you talking about, you …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The dark elf Skevern, who didn’t show any intention to resist, seemed resigned.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though things appeared to be completely settled now… I don’t think it’s possible…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you shake hands when the fight is over? This is the Surface world… though you’re a half-breed, but if you inherited the blood of a demon, you understand what’s going to happen after this, don’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s over…I’m done…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……………… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Or are you going to help me? I can’t… I’m not motivated to join hands with such a person…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Skevern said so in a self-mocking and offhanded manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that speech, as expected even Bro was at a loss for words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that was the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Waha, wahahahahahaha! Really, you all caused such a stir only to go meek in the end, bunch of freaks, see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As soon as the scene had finally settled, Chitsue barged into the place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, this guy is here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, you’ll be punished for insulting me, Bro, you’ll pay for disobeying me, but… First of all, you, ah you guys! The insect will be used in Duel Monsters until it dies, and Skevern will be kept in an underground brothel as a pervert utility for the rest of her life, that they will!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Minister Chitsue…you know…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shut up, Bro, I won’t listen to you anymore!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s so full of rage that the aftertaste of the victory earned with great pains was erased splendidly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Good Grief… So, what are you gonna do, Bro? Will you still go on with your distinction rhetoric and earn this pig’s pocket money in this gambling den as before?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Skevern, and Toulowe too, as things are they can return to their original lives again… no, they’ve knocked up a more miserable life, and you’re just going to linger in your hometown like you always have? Even if it’s a hoodlum, would you also say that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro was unusually silent to the question, which included my sarcasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, he was puzzled by this too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “When it comes to this point, the level of talk is different from baguette head’s direct sales. And you already know that, don’t you? Toulowe and Skevern… and the matter with this minister, it won’t be solved simply by bowing your head, taking responsibility and getting beaten the hell up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It doesn’t matter to me what happens to this gambling den or what happens to the hoodlums. It didn’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for Toulowe, I didn’t feel like taking him to the Demon Realm or letting him escape.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I will strike it with all my might. That was about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for Bro, even if I couldn’t agree with him, I felt like we could at least handle this issue together.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, I haven’t been around as long as you have, but I know that much even if I don’t know the world as much as you do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… maybe so…but…… even so I can’t simply abandon it, this harsh place…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know. Whatever the reason, you’re so committed to this town and this place that you would risk your life… I understand that resolution… but you can’t afford to live like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But then I say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “At first, I wasn’t motivated to go that far with Toulowe. It’s just a matter of fighting as an enemy … and giving cheap sympathy, or at the very least, a serious fight. But, strangely, with Toulowe, maybe because we clashed with each other with all our might… even if he was a criminal… already … claiming ‘It’s nothing to do with me’ was no longer enough.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that the fight is over, my heart was as shaken as it was before the fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~…that’s right… from hating each other, to acknowledging each other before we realized… to exchange fists and before you know it, you become good friends…there are fights like that once in a while… can’t stop them. And? What are you going to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m not asking you what to do. I’m just going to do this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, I stood in front of the Toulowe who couldn’t get up after being treated by Shinobu, as if to face Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth… you… what are you doing…are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… what are you trying to do to my rival?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You…do you know what you’re doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What am I doing? It means that I’m opposing an Imperial Minister.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The opposition to the minister is, so to speak, an act of betrayal to the Empire.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it’s too late now……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It doesn’t matter to me about hoodlum rules or responsibilities. I won’t let a pig like you take away a rival who I had a decent fight with … I, still have much more before we’re done! So you want to use Toulowe until he dies in this gambling den? Then, such a rotten place, I’ll crush it!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wha… what will you do!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That was my answer.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… crush… hey hey…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… let’s settle this… Bro…… right now, the way you hoodlums tend to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You don’t bend. You don’t break. You even risk your life. That’s why you can’t change your mind and let go of this gambling den, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A man who sticks to himself, shows no weakness, and just continues to live as a hoodlum.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That figure showed me a way of life as a man that I had never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’ve already understood that he’s not the kind of guy who can do this with words.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll make that decision by force.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, this is the only way to go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You…with your body like that, you still…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is just fine. You’re the same to begin with.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We were both in tatters. However, the only way to decide the future from here is to use our bodies to clash with each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You and I are going to settle it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… if you win, we’ll disband… if I win, we’ll be as good as ever… that how you want it to be settled?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What to do from here on out?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I told him that if he was already a delinquent, he should act like a delinquent and leave it to the winner of the fight from here on out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha-, h, hey, Earth! Bro! Y-You guys, wh, why are you ignoring me…what are you doing, to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? He? Hold on, what’s happening? Aren’t you guys friends?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, everyone in this place was surprised with a look of dismay.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it can’t be helped. This is the only way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Regardless of the pain engraved all over the body, simply throw everything with this body at the opponent.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So you’re okay with lifting the restrictions, right? Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dear me…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With this power that was sealed when I fought Toulowe, I’ll give Bro some guidance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And I’ll finish it in an instant! 【Breakthrough】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if my body suffered a lot of injury, I can use it enough because I didn’t use any magic power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All that’s left is to throw myself out without fear, just like before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Geez… you’re dazzling, you’re really… I wouldn’t have let you meekly stay a delinquent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t talk like you can dream forever!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I kicked the floor hard and jumped at Bro. I didn’t use small tricks anymore, such as shifting the timing in steps.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I just ran straight to Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let’s go, Oraaaa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tch, uooooooh! 【Arcane True Zenith Crescent Kick】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Counter with a front kick. It’s driven into my liver… But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gah… d, don’t care!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Temple】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I was stopped by Bro’s foot, but I didn’t care, moved forward and hit a blow into his defenseless temple.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu, gu… you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, I learned from the fight against Toulowe. When we had fought in town… I tried to avoid all of your kicking techniques, so there was a lot of useless movements and I was tossed around. So if I jump in like this without fear of being hit a little, I can do as much as I want!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro, who rolled down the floor after being struck by my fist, smiled while distorting his face in pain.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He looked like he’s going to say “You did it” to the way I let him cut my flesh and bone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, growing up in such a short time…I envy you! 【Arcane True Zenith Three-Stage Series Roundhouse Kick】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you stay in the same place forever, you won’t be able to do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ke, you don’t know anything about my life!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Let your feet do the talking! Hoodlum Hoodlum Hoodlum, you use the word Hoodlum as a convenient excuse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar said that the kick has three times as much power as the punch.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, it wasn’t worth taking one shot to give one punch back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m the one who’s going to get hurt first.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I can’t fall down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t use being hoodlum as an excuse…you may not understand this way of life I’m living… but because of how we are, this place that we got is more important than anything else…it may look like a rotten lust-filled space swirling with filthy human desires to you, but it’s a treasure to us. That’s why we can’t easily give it up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I said I’ll destroy it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro stepped in and aimed at my side, which was gouged by Toulowe.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Middle Kick】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, wh, at?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro’s right middle kick. But I saw it coming.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t evade it, I dared to take it once, and I caught it with my left arm tightly against my leg.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After that, I thrust into the inner thigh of Bro’s right leg with my free right hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Screw Hook】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu, ga… ah, Ngaaaahh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The smile disappeared from Bro’s face and only had a painful expression. And at the same time, the feeling that remained in my fist…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, ah…” Tsu… You…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Destroy the right leg. Bro’s footwork stopped… I thought so, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As I said before…for you… it’s a waste… to stay here forever.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why… don’t make it easy for me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro dared to hit a high kick with the right, which should have been broken.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I quickly defended with my arm, but my arm went numb. Bro still had a lot of power left.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As you can see, I’m a half-demon… I’m not a human or a demon. There was no place for someone on the Surface or the Demon Realm… but we had a fight once… we clashed into each other… I was able to understand the hoodlums… they accepted me as a comrade who protected the community together, and they fought with me… they laughed with me… sometimes they cried with me… I can’t leave them alone and pretend I don’t know!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I defended, he immediately swung his leg with a low kick.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This place is not only mine, yeh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Taking it straight, really hurt after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With one shot, my leg went numb and my knee collapsed a little…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re a great chap. I’m glad you put your body up, but… it’s over!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro ran up my collapsed knee like a stepping stone, and with that momentum, he threw his knee at my face…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith Shining Wizard】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Head-butt】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Iyaaaa!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that knee, I launched ahead-butt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m used to it. If I don’t close my eyes, the impact I’ll receive is clearly within expectations.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uo, oh, gut … tsuu …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, it would be a painful blow for Bro.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I heard the sound of Bro’s right knee getting completely crushed on my forehead.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And with the destruction of his knee and thigh, Bro’s right leg is of no use anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe…maybe because of a friend who understood me… like that…… it’s not hard to understand. Me, too… I wanted someone who would recognize me, as ‘myself’, regardless of my title or house… that’s why…… if such a person emerged… somehow… and if it’s for that person, I’ll risk myself as much as I want… I know… that feeling.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it means I understand, too… in other words, it doesn’t have anything to do with being a hoodlum or staying in your hometown, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tsu… you’re saying that… you’ve lost your mind”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he couldn’t use his right leg, Bro’s will to fight hasn’t broken yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He flew high with only the left foot, swung the left foot as it is, and tried to hit me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Arcane True Zenith • Sky Axe Drop】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The foot technique swung with the power that made me think it could split my head in two, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Here! 【Great Demon Smash】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You, how long have you just lingered in your comfort zone!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eye wide open, identify the foot technique, and strike with the fist.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “―――――eehh!!??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My fist and Bro’s foot collide. At that moment, a few fingers in my knuckle probably broke…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Guh, gaaaaaahh!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The sound of Bro’s Achilles tendon being torn and a loud groaning voice echoed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And to Bro, whose legs are destroyed and distorted in pain…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Clench your teeth, and fly!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Great Demon Overhand】!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Finishing Blow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I never hit it in town. The form is also a mess, just a big swinging punch with a lot of momentum.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But it finally hit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah~ hah~… Well, if you still want to stay here forever, then it’s fine… to begin with, I wasn’t one of you… simply…… I’m just going to have to do what I have to do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro was punched in the face and violently hit to the ground after crashing into the floor wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He doesn’t seem to have lost consciousness, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kak… ha… you know…geez, ‘Master’ and ‘Same’…… blurred…… only just passing through…Gaha… I stopped… the former path I was trying to go towards… strength…… the way I used to be…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro, who was hit against the wall, no longer had power in the body, and showed no sign of coming towards me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… I already… when the Mafia was destroyed… I was already burned out…and…… I stayed knowing that there’s nothing ahead of this road… at the very least, I tried to protect my place with my friends…and I couldn’t win… “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Bro looked at me and muttered something as if somewhat refreshed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hey, what are you grumbling about? Isn’t it enough?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Bro slowly looked up at my question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, you… have been taking care of a lot of extra things or doing some kind of extra work… I don’t think you’re a fool… Why is that? Is that how well you got along with that Toulowe Mantis?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I chuckled at the question.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’m not the kind of guy who would normally do this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m not a hoodlum, so why am I doing this?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The other day…met a demon, but… he had a bigger heart than anyone else and we’ve become good friends.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But it’s because he’s kinder than anyone else… he disappeared, saying he would be a nuisance to me if he was around. I couldn’t reassure my good friend because I was weak… it’s related to the racial barrier, maybe it’s because I could only prove it with my mouth…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’ll never forget the regret and helplessness of that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why, even if it’s a demon…we were able to connect with each other with our fists to some extent… If I turn a blind eye to them and say that they are nothing to me… I will never be able to repay Mr. Aka, who considered me his best friend … if I think so… after all…… I have to do something about it…that’s what I thought.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… That’s right… You, too… you’ve been through a lot, yeh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After listening to my words seriously, Bro exhaled as if somewhat convinced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I can’t help… the man who watched us as we were dazzling… got to give my final notice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? …… Are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. That’s enough… I’ve got the answer.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Bro said that and smiled. It was a bit dumb with teeth falling out, but he had a bright smile like a kid.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… H-Hey, hey, wh-what’s going on? Hey, wh, what’s the meaning of this, see? Bro! Earth! You guys go off on your own, what the hell, what is?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, the two of us finally calmed down, and Chitsue shouted at us saying, “Enough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, Bro, who has already given his answer, and said with a neutral expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sorry, Minister Chitsue… I don’t think I can beat this guy who says he wants to destroy this place……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro’s answer made at the end of the fight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m really sorry… And……thank you for taking care of me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You… punk!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And as he dragged his broken legs, Bro said so as he protected Toulowe, Skevern and the others, and turned to face Chitsue.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
