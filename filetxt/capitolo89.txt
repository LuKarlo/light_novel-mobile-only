<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While Bro, who had been stubborn and refused to yield until now, gave in after losing the fight, and on the other hand, with a rather relieved expression, he rebelled against Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I as of now… accept the discharge from being your personal dog…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro, y-you, you! After all I’ve done for you, and this is how you repay me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uh huh, and for that reason I apologize.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The pig turned red with rage. Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And Bro looked back at the stunned Skevern…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… let these guys go too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you ask me, I think their punishments aren’t really fair… rather, it would be worse for you if it’s found out that you were trying to fatten up your pocket by using these guys, right? Well, my guess is that these crimes aren’t officially and fairly judged, and that you’re the one who’s been pulling the strings with all sorts of behind-the-scenes trickery to entrap them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D-Don’t be ridiculous! What a convenient thing to say in the midst of such a sloppy mess! How dare you, who are also the trash of the Empire, give this opinion?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, Chitsue found such a thing unacceptable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Listen, why do you think the world is at peace now, no! Hey, Earth, is it thanks to your father, you think? This is the same as a plain jailbreak in an era without war… yes, in an era without war, it is we politicians who keep the world of peace without war! That you’re enjoying the peace that I have made, and instead of returning the favor to me, you ingrates dare to have an opinion, you do.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I guess so… I don’t really understand noble work… I’ll follow the distinction properly. You and me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue furiously criticized Bro’s defiant state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see…I heard that he was only taking a nap in Congress, but he was working hard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, no matter which one… or rather, distinction?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro, you’re still…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kikikikiki, ki, Gii… Gii!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The door of the back room opened, and a small shadow popped out from inside in fright.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the goblin that had disappeared before I knew it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yasashi! What are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Skevern also asked in surprise, and the goblin appeared with a jerk, and behind it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Garurururu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kyupi? Kyu? Kyu”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were monsters such as demonic wolves and insects who were fighting in Duel Monsters.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey, you bastard, what are you doing? They’re all mine, and some of them were bought at tonight’s auction!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gieeh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugly goblins, what are you letting out of their cages, there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The goblin that was frightened by Chitsue’s yelling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But even so, it didn’t seem to run away, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gigigi… Gigigiiigi (Mutsagouro)…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Huh? …… Hoh~……can it ‘use’ that?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, it cast a spell on itself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, we opened our eyes, but the next moment… the goblin headed for Bro …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I beg of you. Please help these children too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eeeh!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The goblin spoke!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Goblins are intelligent, have villages, tribes, and cultures, and understand human language.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even if they understood the language, I have read in the picture book that they do not speak human words…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, ho, how…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I listened. I heard the story of these children. They were caught suddenly in the woods even when they had done nothing. So they say. I felt sorry for them. Please help.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, wha… Whaaaaat!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The goblin who uttered human words spoke of the feelings of monsters on their behalf.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “They have family. They say. They say they want to go home. They say they don’t want to fight.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ka~…… Are you serious?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Such a goblin… at Yasashi’s words, Bro held his head down and made a complicated expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I thought monsters were the same as animals… there are dogfights, bullfights, cockfights in the surface world, and if it’s so…Oh, dear…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because animals and monsters don’t speak human language, it may be that my heart didn’t hurt too much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even human beings can eat cows and pigs without a thought because they don’t say a word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if you hear their words like this…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha, hahahaha, this is good, good! A goblin that speaks human language. I didn’t know you were such a rarity! It will likely make money at the freak show or an auction, that it will!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it seems that such a goblin’s heart-wrenching words did not reach Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, when it came this far, it’s kind of hard to believe that he is a guy who doesn’t even blink.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geez, we’ve finally gotten in, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whoa, they all look messed up, right? Pathetic.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Minister, are you safe?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, but look at it. Somehow, the monsters and the damned Bro brat are also tattered, aren’t they?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Isn’t it our shift?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And that was the time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tsu, you’re late, see! What were you doing, look here! Even though I’m paying, where were you? Very nearly, I might have died. You see! “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “My bad, minister. The entrance was so crowded that we couldn’t get in.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No excuses, alright! Get rid of these rubbish, do it now!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This time, dozens of adult men slithered in from the entrance of the gambling den in a crowd.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 None gave the impression of any disposition, and they had the same vibe as Chitsue’s guards now lying on this floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, hey… who the hell are they… hey, these guys!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Bro’s expression changed when he saw the adults.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see, the ones laying around here… I thought I’ve seen them somewhere… the Bockmati Family!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Bockmati Family? It should have been crushed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, that’s right, it is. It’s impossible for the executives, but these guys, who were the lower-ranking members, only got a short prison term.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh, at!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Recently, I’ve had a hard time hiring official warriors for escorts, and above all, they monitor activities behind the scenes, and it’s inconvenient because serious and inflexible ones would try to report to His Majesty and Hiro right away. In that respect, these guys will do anything as long as they’re paid, so it’s convenient.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He hired short-term prison thugs to form a private escort group, and then used it to act behind the scenes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s as if this person was more like the Mafia than a Minister.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh, leave it to me, Minister. Bro used to make me drink boiling water.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The monsters are to be caught alive, and the rest shredded, no problem?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? That other kid… huh? Where have I seen him before…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the adults who appeared in a swarm smiled and tried to surround us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It clearly created a violent atmosphere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, here we are, Bro’s body was in no condition to fight anymore, and the others…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Honey… this is our first collaboration”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, no… Oh, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next to me, Shinobu was very motivated. Apparently, she will be going on a rampage with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, that’s fine…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No choice, well then――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was about to rout all the adults away, wondering if I could do as I pleased. But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s enough… you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Bro dragged her broken legs to Chitsue.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The hoodlum Bro is… out of business as of today!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro used his fist, which he had never shown in his previous battles.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eh!!!??””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro had only used kicks in the fights with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He had an obsession with his feet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though the man’s legs were hurt, he beat Chitsue with his fist as he declared his retirement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pue, Pa, ah… you puuuuuunk!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His cheeks were swollen, his nose bled, and his eyes were in tears as he wriggled about the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Neither I nor the adults could immediately react to the scene.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In such a situation, Bro looked back at Skevern…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t think it’ll end with this, but… you’ll be able to lessen your grudges with this, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y, you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… everything else… I’ll leave in the hands of the Empire.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a determined expression on his face, Bro grabbed the fluttering Chitsue’s chest and forcibly pulled it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This guy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro! What are you trying to…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll drag him along like this, and turn myself in to the Imperial City.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha… Haah!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Events and transactions using monsters in this gambling den… I will testify to everything, including any connection with the Anti-Imperialists.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro’s distinction when he said he would graduate from delinquency.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the moment he said that, the adults naturally got angry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nah, this fucking crap!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No way, our moneyman… the Minister…… and are you going to shut down this gambling den?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “From now on, when we’re just about to make a big profit to revive the family…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tch, like hell we’ll let that happen! Hey, boys, let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, this fucker, I’m going to kill you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. In the first place, there’s no way they’re going to allow that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And most importantly…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Pu, Gyaha… Guwahahaha, m-moron, and you … just, who do you think I am, you trash.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue, as he was pulled by Bro, smiled with ridicule, even though he was in tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m a minister, you see! Or, if you were to take me to the Imperial City and hand me over to the Imperial Knights, who would believe the testimony of scum like you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…………”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Naive, and this fool, me! And you’re the mastermind behind this riot, and above all, to think you would hit me, the greatest minister in the world, and get away with it, nuh-uh! You’ll definitely get the death penalty, see!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Even if the other party is rotten, he was a minister.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, he used the hoodlums for labor at the gambling den so that they could be cut off whenever something went wrong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The testimony of the savage delinquents or the words of the Minister of the Imperial Capital. Which one would the world believe?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As for me? But now I’m …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, the resemblance to that extent.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Eh!!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Goblins, adults, and who the hell is it this time?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was about to scream “Not again!?” to the new people, I was surprised to see that person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The brilliance of the passionate youth… I just couldn’t help gazing at it. Therefore, any further redundancy…… I’ll varnish away.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That Old man was there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The young half-breed… that your testimony is accurate, this one will be a witness. If you will take responsibility and reveal everything… I will communicate the remarks directly to Emperor Solja so that this one can protect and judge fairly and impartially.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the Old man who helped me get in.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……… Ah … no … no way?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Shinobu. What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Honey…… I’ll see you later. I love you ♡ poof.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “H, hey!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment she saw the Old man, Shinobu, who was by my side, screamed and backed away, finally said something embarrassing to me, and while throwing a kiss, disappeared in a puff of smoke.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, why!? Do you know him? Oh no, this Old man was from Japone, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what now, all the guests and hoodlums should have gone out!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who are you, sh*tty old timer!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, what’s that? Are you a customer? I don’t know who you are, but it’s an internal mess, so it’s dangerous, could you leave?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. This is just a matter within the Empire. I don’t know which country you are from, but you shouldn’t go deeper ~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora, get the hell out of here or I’ll sink you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Adults mercilessly swore at the Old Man saying, “You’re unrelated so leave.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, no matter where the Old Man is from, he’s probably a foreigner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And since this is a “matter within the Empire”, he was warned not to interfere.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do be silent! As long as the matter involves transcendental issues of Demons, borders are irrelevant as people living on the same world! If there is any suspicion of violation of international law stipulated as common to mankind, it is not a problem for only the Empire! And Minister Chitsue… We can’t overlook the perverse deeds, the abuse, and the excessive use of power by the politician.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Old man raised his voice for the first time.
