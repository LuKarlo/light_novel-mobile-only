 “Ah, it’s not like this or this, but if you do it like this, if you don’t know what to do next……… In a word, this is the case. Now, open the next page.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Academic classes as usual. The lessons progress quickly with the teacher speaking at a faster rate.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those who don’t understand are left behind and screened out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, it doesn’t matter if you do a proper preparation review like me, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ludicrous. The lessons are so inefficient, they miss the point. Is that person truly a teacher? Is he willing to make you understand? Also, do all your lessons differ from historical facts? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Demon King, who was invisible to everyone besides me, has been exhaling sighs from the start of the lesson.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Also, some of the students remain baffled, yet the teacher explains nothing and moves on? Why not ask questions? Tuition has been given, has it not? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Academy teachers comprises of talented people who are qualified to be of the intermediate level or higher of the【Imperial Warriors】.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Dear me, this is the institution that fosters the elite of mankind…? Absolutely horrid.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He completely disapproves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The Thousand swings performed in the previous exercise are of no use. A typical example of gaining pride for merely accomplishing the feat. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eeh? Really? …… Then, why does Sadiz make me do 5,000 reps every day?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis pointless.』 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, the inner thoughts I was having in my mind got a reply from the Demon King like normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… H, hey, you… could it be that…… even if I just talk in my mind… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Ooh!…… seems we can have our conversations in this manner. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Weird. If so, by internalizing my speech we can communicate without speaking out in public, I won’t be treated as a lunatic who is talking to himself?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, now about that topic…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「M, More importantly, I’m a little concerned, but… practice-swings are useless? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I do not mean to say the act makes no sense at all. You will improve in mental aptitude and physical strength. However, the manner you and the other students employ makes little sense of it. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… eh… no way…」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The swing is to solidify the mold and form. Through repetition, you will naturally be able to move in the correct form. However if you increase the frequency to such pointless degree, you shall lose your form due to fatigue and adopt the wrong form numerous times. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… re, really… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In general, you are simply swinging without a thought. In actual battle… do you swing at your opponent’s image? When exhausted, you need to at least be able to adopt a basic form, should you not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was at that moment my years of hard work were completely denied.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I was quite simply subdued by the shock, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In that sense…yet, while still conscious of that, being able to perform a thousand swings effectively… there is one person in this class.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Not you? The girl in front, diagonally from you.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shockingly, besides me, there was a person The Demon King admitted he recognized.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What kind of amazing person is it to be recognized by that demon king for a moment? I thought, then immediately realized that there was only one such person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That blonde girl… who is she? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A princess with beautiful long golden hair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ah. Princess Phianse. 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Princess…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Oh. Of this empire… His Majesty the Emperor… to you, better known as Solja of the Seven Heroes? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Eh!? Hoh~…… Solja… that effeminate Magic Spear Knight… he was the prince at the time, but has taken the role of Emperor now… reasonable… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was the bloodline of the person well known by the Demon King, deep down I was emotionally moved as I nodded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… tis true that she is of good pedigree. The sword swings were also splendid, and the amount of intrinsic magic power is remarkable at that age… to fully comprehend the contents of this low-level teacher’s class… remarkable… a genius.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, it came with a complete high praise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In short, the princess is so amazing she is praised to that extent by the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Although the child is truly talented… at the moment that girl is superior.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Ugh?! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, same as everyone else… this bastard…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oow!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the chalk from the instructor flew to my forehead, and I was not able to avoid it as I was off my guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, why so absent-minded, Earth? Your hands haven’t moved at all for a while, and you’ve been staring intensely at Phianse.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”…… eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeehhh!!??.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The chalk attack stopped the fast-paced high-speed lesson, and caused some teasing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To this, every eye in the class is turned to me all at once, and they laughed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the leading princess herself does not look back to me, but her face is red with anger, and she is trembling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s this? You don’t like me, but you get upset when I am made fun of…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Seriously, okay? Earth. It doesn’t matter if you’re the son of a hero. As long as you’re in this classroom, the hero’s son and the empire’s princess are just students. Just Earth and Phianse. So let me tell you this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the instructor walks up to me with a serious look while the class is suspended.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Soon, the final career award submission and the selection of the matches for the graduation anniversary will be announced. If you have good results in your three years, you’re sure to get your desired career path… Well, there is no doubt that the Imperial Knights will be selected for the match. Graduating from the academy and getting the job you want isn’t your goal, it’s a start. Now you’re just doing a pre-start preparation exercise. It’s up to you to get to the starting line, how you run from there and what kind of goal you want to achieve after you graduate. So you don’t have to listen because you already know the content of the class perfectly, but you still listen. A guy who neglects the preparation exercise can lead to failure. Do you understand?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor pokes my head while he was preaching and returned to the platform again, laughing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Geez, so hot-blooded…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hoh~… 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Demon King, who listened to the sermon from the instructor to me, nodded as if impressed…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The class is deplorable, but he does have some decent things to say, that teacher.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, now he’s praising the instructor he called horrid a while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I understand what I was told, and I agree to a point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, when the Great Demon King gives recognition to a human being, I should recognize them too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, Earth. Answer this history question about the demon army I’m going to issue now. If you can’t answer… It’s supplementary lesson after school for you!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Geh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What!? Such inconvenience… I was promised to visit the city afterwards. Do not take supplementary lessons.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A sudden question. If I can’t answer, I’ll have to make up for it… Not good, I was talking to the Demon King, and wasn’t paying attention to the lesson.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The 【Three Major Magic Eyes】 that exist in the world of humanity and the demons. Name these three, further name the Magic Eye that the Great Demon King Tre’ainar was said to have and its abilities… Answer it all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “A, all the abilities!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s wrong? If you listened to the class, you should know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The question about the Three Major Magic Eyes. In that case, I can manage. I mean, it is a question about the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu-…… Eh, yes. The 【Three Major Magic Eyes】are【Heraldic Eye】, 【Moonlight Eye】, and【Lucent Eye】. Among them, the magic eye that the Great Demon King Tre’ainar is said to have been in possession of…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m sure it was Heraldic Eyes. I know that much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there were a lot of abilities related to Heraldic Eyes. Answer everything correctly …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Heral—“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Child! This is question is a ruse! Do not be fooled! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「…… huh? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I was stopped by the voice of the Great Demon King, the perpetrator himself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what does he mean by a ruse?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I never, the question is about me… however, I set a trap for my opponents.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Wh, what do you mean? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, my magic eye… it was during wartime, when I divulged to possessing Heraldic Eyes, but in fact it was misinformation.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Humanity was the enemy… so I spread the fabrication to deceive your father.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Seriously? I didn’t know that. Because, the Demon King’s Heraldic Eyes were pretty well known.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The eyes I posses… are the eyes that further evolved from the Heraldic Eye. Tis called the 【Six-Gate Eye(Rikudou gan)】.』 [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Si, Six-Gate? It is the first time I’m hearing this, but… 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh, tis the eye that is believed to be the root of all Magic Eyes. In the first place, tis said that the three Major Magic Eyes were branched out in the midst of their long history as the 【Six-Gate Eye】 was passed down to the descendants. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「What, eh, no way… really? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Yes, in short, that is the answer when it comes to the question of the three Major Magic Eyes, as a matter of fact, my eyes are not among the three Major Magic Eyes, they are of a class above them. 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So it was, had the originator himself not informed me, I would have been made to take the supplementary lesson without a doubt.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that case, he should naturally know the answers about his abilities.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was lucky it was a question about the Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth. Answer quickly. What are the eyes of the Great Demon King?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The eyes… The eyes of the beginning of all, not among the three great magic eyes. 【Six-Gate Eye】!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I answered the instructor in full confidence with a smile.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… What? 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The instructor made a dumbfounded face as he tilted his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The rest of my classmates started buzzing about my answer, and…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Y-Yes sir?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ”……Don’t make up magic eyes just because you don’t know the answer!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s enough, go stand in the hallway!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh!? Th-The answer was wrong?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Uooooooh, Great Demon Kiiiiiiiiing!? 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『N- No! Tis no lie, truly! This teacher’s lessons are inaccurate! My eyes are of the six-gates! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Damn you, you taught me Bullsh*t! 」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Believe me! Tis no falsehood! This teacher ignorant of historical facts! Consult with your father and mother! Tis not a lie! Did I not reveal it during the final battle? There is no doubt that the Emperor of this country is aware! 』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thus, I ended up being punished for the lie the Great Demon King told me. However, it seems the answer I gave would come to have unforeseen consequences.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] I know a certain [Dropout Swordsman ] that would say otherwise. Cool series, check it out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Seemed a lot like Naruto’s Rinnegan and the Sage of Six paths. Six Gates seemed more original to me.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
