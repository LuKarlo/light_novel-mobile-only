 “Who the hell is this geezer, ha? Bro, Earth, who do you think I am? This, insolence, see! Quickly get the geezer too!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Chitsue, who was more conscious of the words the Old man directed at him rather than who he was, ordered the goons to capture him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the Old man sighed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu… Solja has it hard, too… I’m much obliged to the Pauhala family’s predecessors and owe a debt of gratitude, eternally… well, I saved that one many times as well.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Hey, now, Old man, are you referring to “His Majesty” in that manner?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the moment the adults took out their weapons one after another and were ready to attack, two men appeared out of nowhere beside the Old man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-roukou, I have a report!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… But before that, these ones… shall we …?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those two are the men that the Old man brought with him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, for the time being, as it has come to this, it can’t be helped. Ashisotu-san, Kesu-san…… please stand down you two. I’ll discipline them personally.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “” Ha~ … again … “”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After telling them not to interfere, the next moment, the Old man took off his mask.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From under it, I thought the Old man was as thin as a dead branch, but the light of eyes and his belligerent smile were very different from the gentle image I had when I first met him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Huh? That Old man… Somewhere…… if I remember correctly… at the Academy… something…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis said that human life expectancy is short… Surely… to think he was still alive…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar chuckled, somewhat dumbfounded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, shall we—”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Calm doooooownn! Ah, excuse my sudden large voice. We’ve something to declare.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tha, o, n-nu!? To… Ashisotu-san!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, you should have done this from the beginning. You’re of old age, therefore please refrain from scuffles.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the Old man was about to run, the man called Ashisotu took out an accessory, something like a medal with some symbol on it and held it up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As the Old man tried to run forward, he immediately slipped down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But more than that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah… That mark is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Me, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeh, wh, wh … wha, huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””…… ah……””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both Chitsue and the adults became speechless when they saw the symbol and the revealed true face of the Old man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, I’ve seen it, too.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I finally remembered why the Old man looked familiar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, it’s a textbook! In a history textbook… huh? Textbook…… tte, wha!?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He once fought deadly battles with the Demon King’s army… Former Deputy Commander of the ‘Ground Allied Forces’ established to bring together the justice of all mankind, including the Empire and Japone… He’s Lord ‘Mikado'”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eh!!?””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So don’t resist. Even if you resist, everyone here… this one might kill you in less than ten seconds… no…… some…… eradication…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m extremely aware of that name… or rather… I should say legend… he is also a war hero, Mikado!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “L, L… Lord Mikado… wh, why… why, as for this, discourtesy… I… wh, why, in a place like this…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, as expected, Chitsue found it unbearable, and immediately fell on both knees and hung his head on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, you don’t have to humble yourself, Minister Shtsui. I’ve already stepped down from my position… what’s more, I am a vassal of Emperor Solja of the Dipercha Empire, not particularly another subordinate … although…… as an advisor of the Union, I am permitted to survey member states…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, u… ha, no, th-that is… that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, I don’t have the authority to judge you… therefore, I must only report the facts as they are. Including Bro Glenn’s testimony. On top of that, we will conduct a fair and equitable investigation, and if as a result, you are found violating the common international laws of the Union… you can expect harsher words from the Imperial and Allied forces.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Tha, no, such a… I, I… I just…just…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He has already retired from active duty. However, his voice and influence still held great power in the Surface World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The hero who had been fighting the Demon Realm and the Demon King’s Army long before my parents were born, I heard that even the Seven Heroes were no match for him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro Glenn… is that alright with you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha~, haha… already… I can’t tell… what is what… but…… it’s an honour to meet you, Old man… uh, Lo-Lord Mikado?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufu, I don’t mind, right now I’m a mere Old timer.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this unexpected tempest, Bro was laughing as if he was amazed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, there was no objection at all to Bro, the Old man… no, I nodded to Mikado.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Bro… you…… is that alright with you? Even if you testify, you’re… either way, you’ll be implicated as well, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s okay. I’m… like I used to be… like you now… Also, I have to be able to walk on my own feet… so that’s okay… everyone in the Kamikaze Gang… it’s already… I’ll have you walk on your own feet.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know how much crime Bro is guilty of, but he’s at least innocent, if not blameless …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Perhaps, it is possible that he would be sent to prison as it is.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But,
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Originally… the place made by the adults … I and Minister Ush*tsui took over… responsibility… no, we’re going to have to pull the curtain back… Hoodlums… we’re moving on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro laughed that he was prepared for it all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tch, even though you’re delinquent from beginning to end… so you intend to be stylish… even though you’re a worthless hoodlum to the world!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s cool, isn’t it? So, even if something happens in the future… don’t be like me. If your heart rots and you’re about to lose your way, remember this stupid hoodlum and try not to do the same, right? Brother.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I don’t need a stupid brother like you… I already said that. “
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkakaka!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I couldn’t say much more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufufu… be that as it may… you are Earth, aren’t you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I saw you only once as a baby… I didn’t notice it at first because you don’t look like Hiro, but… why are you here? I was listening to your conversation with Ush*tsui, and it seems you’ve done something wrong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you know who I am? No, maybe that’s the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because, this Old man… he’s not only a comrade of my father and my mother… but their master in the war…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, rather than that, why am I here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you don’t mind, will you tell me what happened? Both Hiro and Mamu are comrades who shed blood and raised the same justice and cause, even if our countries were different, they’re like grandchildren to me… which makes you, like my great-grandson.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…what…happened…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And more than anything else… I’ve been watching your fight, and it made my heart leap… if I can help you, I want to help you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Mikado asked me in the same kind and gentle air as when I first met him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I can’t say anything about that question…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah yes, O-roukou. This is a report I couldn’t say earlier, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? What is it, Ashisotu-san?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I was informed by a merchant who was among the fleeing guests earlier… Princess Phianse, daughter of Emperor Solja… and Mamu seem to be heading for this town, and he’s already right under our noses.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What!? Is that true?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh… at…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mother? The princess? Why? How?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you have anything to do in this town?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, now… it can’t be…for me? But then why the princess?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But anyway, my mother is heading to this town…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Broooo! Leadeeeeer… Bro? H, hey, this is… wh-what’s going on… the minister, too… I mean, Bro, what’s with the injuries?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, well, I’ll talk about it later. So, what happened?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the baguette head had a sudden change in his expression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “N, now at the entrance of the town… th, the princess… the princess of this country, and Mamu of the Seven Heroes, came along with a few others! The guests and merchants were already in a big panic, and Mamu and the others said, ‘What the hell is this all about?’ I mean, I’m already out there panicking… hey, what do you want me to do?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, seriously…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kakkaka… Oh, come to think of it, I heard they were coming soon… no way, I didn’t think they would be here today… did they come to this town in such a hurry… ah…… well personally, it saves me a lot of trouble. It’s just…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In that situation, Bro sighed, and at the same time put his hand on my shoulder.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s inconvenient for you.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Bro smiled at me as if he were sensing something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Bro… no way, you… about me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “About that? I don’t know you. You’re a good buddy. That’s all I know. So…… you may be able to go home, but… if you still don’t want to go home… if that’s the path you’re on, then you should go now. Just, I’ll say it over and over again, but don’t be like me, yeh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then he hit me on the back with his hand and pushed me out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s telling me to, “Go.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, at first I was wondering what to do, but… But…… maybe you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master’s twisted ambition and ideology… that fellow’s situation… nuh-uh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master? Fellow? What are you talking about?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Whaaaat, if you happen to meet my Master, who is also my first love and see themselves as my Sister, someday…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t really understand what Bro was saying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Master? Sister? What does anything have to do with it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the end, Bro eventually looked up without telling me what he meant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, later then!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, he slapped me on the back again, saying words reminiscent of a life’s farewell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to those words, I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I’ll see you later.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right, I returned it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What? What are you doing, Earth? Now that Mamu is here, we need to talk…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Breakthrough!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Goodbye, Elder!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Old man showed me kindness to help me in many ways, however I’m sorry, but I’ve already put my “blunder” in the past and moved on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that I didn’t want to go back, I activated a breakthrough and ran out of the place in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I jumped out of the gambling den, the stairs, and the town…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Heeeeeey, everyone, be quiet! They’re not all blacklisted merchants!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason, mother was holding sluggish merchants on both sides…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What exactly do you mean? Moreover, according to what I’ve heard, Minister Chitsue is here. I’m not listening to anything! Hey, get out of the way and let us in!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess raised her voice while showing her annoyance to panicked nobles and delinquents…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, I’m going to capture the merchants who are trying to escape, Coman, Fu. And we’ll hear what happened.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fe, u, uh-hun, I understand, Rebal… em, wi, with my flute… Right away, I’ll manipulate them all and make them confess. erm, no matter what they’re hiding, they’ll spit it all out…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Coman… it’s been a long time, but… to be honest, I mean… that’s scary, isn’t it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, even them?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal. Coman. And even Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The purpose is… no, don’t think about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eeh, Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””Eeehh!!!???””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the time that voice was heard, it was too late.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If even one step behind in my breakthrough state, no one can catch up anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, Earth! Hey, wait! Wait, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man… please… please talk to me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, where are you going? It’s me. I’m right here, Earth! Stop, st, stay there!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth, what are you doing? Wait, won’t you say anything to us, I won’t let you leave again!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s… uh, my flute… uh, no good, out of range.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Just made it, fortunately the entrance of the gambling den was in turmoil.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if everyone noticed me, they couldn’t kick ordinary people out of the way, so they weren’t able to chase after me right away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Don’t look back, I’m…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I told you to wait, hey, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Can’t you hear me telling you to stop!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, there are only three of them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m sorry, Rebal, Fu, Coman! This is ――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Leave it to us! Hey, Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Only three people scraped through the crowd, jumped out, and chased after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But more than that…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… tch…”

 Of all people, those three. Darn……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hou~, Mamu is a matter of course, that the other two are capable… even if they cannot catch up with you in the breakthrough state, they will never be so far away that they lose sight you…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『When your time expires… they might be able to catch up, will they not?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Once the breakthrough is lifted, you can catch up. I agreed with what Tre’ainar told me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean of course. Even at the best of times, I’m pretty tired.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there were three of them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now that you mention it, I… hide and seek, tag or anything else… I’ve never won against Sadiz… I’ve never beaten the princess… not to mention, my mother is a Hero…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As it is, once the breakthrough expires, they will catch up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, regardless of my intention, for now… they will take me home?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Don’t bullsh*t me. You don’t come here, loiter in the past you’ve cut off and get in the way of my journey.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With a click of my tongue, I just ran, ran, and kept on running.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While we were in such a chase, none of us had noticed yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “THERE~ ・YOU~ ・ARE~”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A shadow was overlooking us against the backdrop of the moon shining in the dark night.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Could it be… to think I would find it this soon… I was to have Bro cooperate with me in the search for it, but… Fufufufu…… my one and only God… about 498340000 seconds since I lost thee… for the first time in many years this heart of mine races… what that thing means to thee I know not, but… whoever has inherited the power of the Great Demon King shall be in my hands!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The shadow flapped its jet-black wings and shed tears while smiling…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That been said, all those swarming flies shall be erased…… THAT・ONE・BE・LONGS・TO・ME”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The madness of the goddess, clad in the armor of a Dark Valkyrie, was closing in on me.

 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ladies and gentlemen, I am always indebted to you.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s been quite a long time, but I think I’ll separate the arcs with this.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thank you very much for reading so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, it’s hot, so I’ll take it a little slower. Please take care of your health.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And now!
