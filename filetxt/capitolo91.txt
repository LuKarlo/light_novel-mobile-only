 In the middle of the journey. While still in the woods.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Kohon, Kohon… Mm, Kohon…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was next to me, coughing unnaturally.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he’s glancing sideways at me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oi, child… the Go board that was purchased in town earlier… you did not forget it, did you?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Agh”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By the way, how many times have you asked this question?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I bought a portable, foldable and easy-to-carry Go board as a souvenir in the town of Honeyborough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar seems to be very concerned about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, I’m not bothered by it. It is likely he’s appealing to me. I’m not so shallow in my relationship with this guy that I don’t understand that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… wanna take a break… to play a game?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Fah!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, Tre’ainar’s eyes sparkled as the Majesty of the Great Demon King collapsed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I shall play you! Umm, it cannot be helped, child. Um, I will play you! Come on, let us play it! Let us play it right away!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After playing a game of Go for the first time in over a dozen years, seems he’s been dying to play again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, for someone who couldn’t interact with the world, his only form of entertainment was to see the scenery in front of him through me, read with me, chat with me, and guide me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And he’s been like this since he realized that he could play Go with me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Jeez, I’m the only one who can do it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s so happy, and I can’t refuse to play with him like that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I sat on the ground in the forest, opened the Go board, and lined up the pieces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the meantime, because I line up the stones for two people, I put the Go pieces on both sides, but I made Tre’ainar sit face-to-face in order to create the atmosphere of a game.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Come on, child. You may place as many pieces as you will. I shall have you enjoy the Demon King’s move!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar looked excited with his arms folded. It’s a little annoying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can place as many pieces as I want. In Go, if there is too much difference in ability, one is allowed to place extra pieces first as a handicap. Which means that there is that much difference in ability between Trainer and me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it pissed me off when he said it so blatantly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I don’t want to. I can play a little, too, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu, is that so? Well…… in that case…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So, let’s go! Also, the first move is mine!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I’m not terribly good at Go, but having been trained by Sadiz for a long time, I think I’m a decent player.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Of course, I can’t say that I’m stronger than Shinobu from the other day, and I don’t think I can beat Tre’ainar, but I was so frustrated that I thought I should at least play the first game with no handicap.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, instruct me.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, then… Lower left, stars』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was hoping that since it’s Tre’ainar, he’d play me without a handicap and whip me into shape… I thought, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ora”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Upper right, star』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Lower left Kosumi───────』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was only a few minutes from the start.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve only played a few moves yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be clear, Go is a game that uses dozens of moves to advance…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “—…re…der…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Hmm? Child ~ I can not hear you~? What was that~? If you do not speak clearly~, I cannot hear ♪.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A few minutes from the start, already Tre’ainar was grinning with a smug face after a few moves.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, I was yelling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I・SU・REN・DER you darn idiot! You, what are you playing without mercy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, good heavens, do not get so heated.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Usually, you would go easy on me! No, I’m the one who said no handicap! But there’s a limit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My thoughts were naive. After Shinobu, it’s his first time playing in a long time, so Tre’ainar ruthlessly cut me down.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To invite me and kill me instantly… I don’t think I can win.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Well, now now, settle down, child. Why not continue playing this game a little longer?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I hung my head with sulky feelings, Tre’ainar made a remark that sounded like whipping a corpse under these circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, that is……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait a minute, continue this? What are you going to do with this play? No matter how much I can do to this point, even I can understand that winning is not possible anymore.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even if you cannot, I can.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… ha? No way, how in the …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Let us exchange your pieces with mine. I shall accept this super-inferior situation as a handicap.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’d you say?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was such a ridiculous suggestion but I thought I shouldn’t make fun of it either.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s true that I’m overwhelmingly weaker than Tre’ainar, but it’s impossible to reverse from such an already annihilated situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? Y-you’re looking down on me! Don’t joke around, that is definitely impossible ─────”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t know yet.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That the opponent was the omnipotent and omniscient Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter how many hours, days, months, or years it took me, he would strike a string of unthinkable moves one after another.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And a few minutes later ────
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Never again…… I’m done…… I’ll never play you again… Damn it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From the situation where I was cut off and surrendered, Tre’ainar turned it around and I was cut off again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At this point, I felt ridiculous in many ways.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I shed tears.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I overturned the board and slept unfaithfully on the spot.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Oh, dear! D, did I overdo it? Say, child, once again! Hear? One more time! I will adjust it just right this time, will I not? Once more.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… No way…… I’m going to bed… I can’t play Go any more…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nuah! Oh, tis quite cruel! T-tis so. I shall teach you. Huh? How about it? Huh?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thus, for a while, Go had become traumatic to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Woah! Okay, dude needs to learn restraint. Reminds me of when I would wreck my siblings at Tekken, while holding the controller with one hand. They never played me again. And also when I played Tekken online… And got wrecked… I never tried that again.
