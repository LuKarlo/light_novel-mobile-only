 I can’t catch up to him at full speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a child, when I played tag with Little man, I would lead Little man around by his nose, whether I was the one chasing him or the one being chased.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But now, even though I chase after him with all my might, I can’t catch up with that Little man’s back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I felt frustrated, regretful, and pathetic, but on the other hand, I think that it is unscrupulous to have such feelings under these circumstances.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The power in that match was still real… Little man… without me knowing… without realizing it while I was by your side… in a really big way… and finally getting stronger…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know why Little man used the skill of the Great Demon King, and I thought that it might have been some mistake.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But this is the only truth that shouldn’t be twisted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man really, really grew strong.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For me, the Little man I’ve always thought would never change since he was little… has become independent…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “All right, everyone, today we’re going to play imperial house with me today as rehearsal for the future!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m suddenly reminded of the old days.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Princess Phianse in her childhood proposed a cute game in the palace garden.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In response to the proposal, Little man, Fu, and Rebal, were embarrassed and had delicate looks on their faces.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I, naturally, am the Empress! Well, of course! And Rebal is the Commander of the Imperial Knights and the Prime Imperial Warrior!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Me? Such an amazing role?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. And Fu is the Strongest Mage in the Empire!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Mm-hmm! All right, I’ll do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were positions that these children had a lot of potential for in the future, and it was really a rehearsal exercise.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were still very small, 5-year-old child prodigies.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was nine years old at the time, and I spent my days learning etiquette and manners from the palace maids, as well as taking Little man to and from the palace.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The scene of such a nostalgic day.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Little man seemed dissatisfied with the princess’ proposal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… As for me? eh, why!? Why is Rebal a knight commander and a warrior prime? Isn’t it me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? U~umm, yeah, uh, that’s right, I, I forgot the role of Earth, so careless, u~umm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was a lie.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess shows an obvious ‘careless’ state whenever she is totally lying.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the princess while looking quite shy…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O-Okay, apologies, well, yes, let Earth play the role of Emperor! Oh, my King! You must be happy!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh~~, Emperor~?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man had a disgruntled face. Master Rebal was also sulking a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the role, after all, when the lid was lifted, the Emperor and Empress …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, start! Oh, Your Majesty, no, no, when we’re alone, oh, you… would you like to have dinner? Take a bath? O, or, m, me?” [1] [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It had nothing to do with the Emperor or Empress any more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, somehow, Master Rebal and Master Fu were pitifully being excluded from playing house.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But the one I felt most sorry for was…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, as expected, playing house is boring, let’s play something else.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? Uhhhhh… No, it’s an order! Earth is the Emperor! That’s why!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wrong, I’m going to be a hero, like dad, so that’s better!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He doesn’t understand her behavior which was so easy to comprehend, or rather I don’t think he’s interested… the princess was the one I felt most sorry for, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Sadiz, hey, Sadiz let’s play!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man runs up to me, who is supposed to be able to play with him at any time of day in a sense. The princess became sullen at such a figure…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess caught Little man and pulled his hand. Then the princess glared at me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We’re going to play by ourselves! We don’t need some aunty!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I couldn’t help crying out.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz is not my aunt!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, she’s an old lady, Earth! Because Sadiz is nine! That’s almost ten years old! Well, that’s what the maids said, oh, new something… So, Sadiz is a new recruit!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Not true! Sadiz is a… fai… fair maiden.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He said so in an embarrassingly bewildered manner, Little man at that time was too damned cute, I was already…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nooooo! She’s fa, she’s fa, fa!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hey, Phianse! Stop pulling!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ancient Monster Sadiz Go Away! Bleh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess angrily took Little man by force, and made a rude facial gesture at me. [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I’ve known the princess since she was a baby, and for me, it wasn’t without some little sisterly feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, when I was still young, I was not good at controlling my desire to monopolize Little man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I won’t give Little man to anyone…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hii!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I won’t let you take him anywhere. Also? Who is the ancient monster? Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In an instant, moved around and cut in front of the princess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess’s face was drawn with fear. And the princess…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, oh, I’ll protect Phianse!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Rebal~, it’s no good, you can’t beat Sadiz…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really, Master Rebal, who was afraid of me, held a tree branch to protect her as if he were a knight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Master Fu was hiding scared in Rebal’s shadow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuu~… everyone gets a little spanking… except ‘Little man‘.“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eehh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve been given permission from all your parents to do so.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Declaration of Punishment with Pressure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the young masters, who were even younger than I was at the time, shuddered and trembled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “U, U~… everyone, run away from the monster Sadiz!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, we’re playing tag? But, all right, I’m going to beat Sadiz today!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, re, remember, I’ll win someday!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “We…… We can’t win.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, the princess shouted for everyone to run away from me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Little man is very determined to play tag.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Rebal looked frustrated.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Fu was being faint-hearted.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They were four such child prodigies, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you want to run away? It’s okay, right. Then, I’ll count from ten… 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1… Ready? Even if you’re not, here I come… or to be more precise.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Ah……””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ve already caught everyone…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It began in ten seconds, and within five seconds, all four of them were held on either sides of me and in nooses.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Th, that’s… t, too fast.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, Damn it … I thought I was going to escape for just five seconds today!“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is… Sadiz, the rising star of the new era… my father admitted it, too…“
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I said we can’t win…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, there was such a difference in power at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hahaha … amazing, Sadiz… if those four are like Sadiz, they’ll realize that they still have to work hard.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. As I thought, maybe Sadiz doesn’t have to wait until she’s twelve years old to be admitted to the academy with special treatment by skipping grades.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While smiling at us as they took a break from work, the Emperor and my Master, sometimes the Empress and the Madam, would be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But the child Mamu protected in ‘the Former city of Sorcery, Shiznautmy’ was such a genius…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah. At that time… she didn’t really open up to me, but… but now she really is Earth’s ‘Big Sister‘.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It’s been five years since the demise of the Great Demon King Tre’ainar… and above all I’m glad to see that her heartbreak is healing… as it is, I hope that she’ll continue to be a sister and a familiar target for Phianse, too.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Well, it’s not like everything’s over… there’s still a big “mystery” about that city… even the former member of the Six Supremacy, La’iphant, doesn’t know about the matter either… And the only person who seems to know about the mystery is that Jamdi’el, the one who was with Tre’ainar when he destroyed the city.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “La’iphant said that it’s likely that Jamdi’el is in hiding on the Surface World, not on the Demon Realm… if he’s right…… for example, she would be lurking in ‘the Isolationist Nation, Cacretale‘ which was uninvolved in the war with the Demons.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I can’t carelessly get involved… seriously… even though we defeated Tre’ainar and thought we were making progress in our relationship with the demons little by little, I can’t help but worry… and… what worries me the most is…’Hakuki’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. In addition, Tre’ainar’s influence is still deep-rooted both in the Demon Realm and among the demon races. There are religious groups claiming ‘God, Tre’ainar, will be reborn. Search for the Reincarnation, God’s Second Coming.‘ and hunters whose eyes change at the legend of ‘Buried treasure left by the Great Demon King Tre’ainar‘ being circulated.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For several years after the war, His Majesty and the Master were constantly struggling with all the hard work, but their eyes, which watched over the princess and the young masters, were still gentle, and their troubles were full of the will to work harder for the children of the coming era.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’ve always decided from an early age that I should protect Little man and raise him properly for my benevolent Master and Madam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come, Little man. Let’s go home.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sadiz, it’s embarrassing, so don’t pick me up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, he’s still a child, so he’ll be in my arms. Also, you played outside and got filthy, so I’ll give you a bath and get you cleaned up.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even if he tried to budge, I will forcibly hug Little man and show that, ‘He’s mine’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The princess was groveling and gnashing her teeth after being spanked by me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ugh~, Earth… ah, Sadiz. Earth is mine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, eventually Little man will be the princess’… I knew that they would lead this empire, the world, and humanity to a better place.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, for me just a little bit longer… while holding such feelings, I’ve always embraced Little man…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who is still a child… I…… myself…… I thought I knew more than my Master, the Madam, and more than anyone else in the world …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I resent my incompetence and narrow sightedness from the bottom of my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn, I’ll beat Sadiz someday! And become stronger than Sadiz… Someday… Someday… Sadiz… m, my, pretty …bride…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Fufu…… give it your all, Little man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why haven’t I even been able to praise the stronger Little man directly yet?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When Little man grows up and becomes stronger, it’s my duty to tell him “You’ve done great” before anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And yet, I can’t even speak to him now, he ignores me, I give chase and can’t catch up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Looking at the back of the boy running through at the speed of light that I couldn’t catch up with, I bit my lips and desperately chased after him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">

 [S1] She was five at the time. How put that notion in her head already? I’m looking at you Mamu!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] In the raws, she’s making an [Akanbe-(アカンベー)]. It’s a gesture where you pull an eyelid down as you stick your tongue out. Quite rude if you ask me…
