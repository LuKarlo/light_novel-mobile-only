<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For how long, I wonder…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I might have been underestimating Earth, who was always on equal footing with me, no, who was pulling everyone as our leader when I was young.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Among us childhood friends, Earth did not have unrivaled growth rate or special talent like Rebal and Fu.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth himself seemed to be aware of that when he entered the Academy, he didn’t talk about his dreams like he used to, and was somewhat sulky.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was strict with Earth, telling him that “This is not good enough for the man who will become my husband and the next Emperor of this country ” and “Make Earth a better man”, trying to fulfill my duty as a “fiancé”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In fact, I wanted to go on dates like couples of my age do without worrying about the public eye, but I had to restrain myself and endure it until Earth became man enough to not complain to anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Occasionally, there might have been girls trying to woo Earth, but erm, well, that was, umm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the very least, until I graduated from the Academy… that’s what I thought. But Earth was also a boy. The information from Sadiz also confirmed that he was in possession of a smutty book. If Earth couldn’t bear it, well, I was prepared to go anytime, but in the end Earth never came on to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I sometimes felt anxious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Doesn’t Earth want to make progress with me? Huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because of that anxiety, when I learned that Earth was trying to beat me and win the match and confess to something, I was so happy that I could ascend to heaven.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And when Earth wielded enough power to overwhelm Rebal, I was astonished, but at the same time thrilled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The charm of Earth as a man exceeded my tolerance, and I was so aroused that I wanted him to embrace me immediately.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, Earth ran away from me who was in such a dreamy state.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I have no idea why. He hit Lord Hiro, despaired over something, and, according to hearsay, wielded the power of the once-destroyed Great Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was always with him at the academy and had many a mock battle with Earth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I know the power of Earth better than anyone else in the world, even better than Sadiz. Even I didn’t know the power that Earth wielded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was clear that something was happening to Earth without my knowledge.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, no matter how much I think about it, I couldn’t understand it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why I’m on the chase for him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No matter what kind of wife I become, I will not be a woman who just sits still.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Phianse… No…… Princess. Leave it up to us to track Earth down.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What did you say, Lady Mamu? As a wife, would you leave your husband if he ran from home?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… yeah…… me, Hiro and His Majesty… if it really did happen someday. We were talking about our dreams… but…… that was our wish… and we were ignoring Earth’s feelings. And we…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “??”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To you… I’m really sorry… we’ve done something that gave you strange expectations…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Really. I’ve even made my future mother this concerned for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In other words, in the current situation where Earth has done various things and has been cursed by the people of the Imperial City, it would be difficult for Earth to become my husband, and it was rather difficult to let me do this out of concern for the trouble he would cause me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You needn’t say a word, Lady Mamu.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Certainly… I didn’t know about Earth… my life’s greatest failure as far as I’m concerned.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did Earth do this? What happened to Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even if I worry about it, I won’t get an answer by dwelling on it, so it’s no use thinking about it now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But if I didn’t know… I’ll learn from now on. Then, no matter what he did, no matter what the world thinks of Earth, I will not abandon Earth. I will not give up on Earth.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. Our mutual love is precious… we can already be called couple with no objections, and as a couple, we have no intention of separating, in order words, we’re basically husband and wife. [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, it doesn’t seem that… Earth… about the princess… umm…… as a woman…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, I understand. Then, I’ll make him fall in love again after catching him. That’s fine with you, right?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Princess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, you think I’ll back down from just that? Obstacles are inherent in love, and it will only they burn brighter when they are overcome. Then, let’s go capture Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Too much, Mamu was so concerned about me that she said something like “Earth doesn’t love me anymore …”. She said such a “lie” to keep me away from this matter it seems, but I’m not childish enough to fall for such tricks.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth and me. Our connection cannot be severed or overturned by anyone.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 From “that time” when we first came across my Earth …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s why I told you to wait, hey… Earth!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, to make a woman chase after you, a considerable amount of punishment is needed later.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I’m giving my best effort to catch up to him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But no matter how much I run, I wonder how far…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Why did he rush out and suddenly flee… who are you … I don’t understand the circumstances, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Who? The voice of a young woman. And a presence.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment the three of us stopped at the same time, three small knives fell from above and stabbed to the ground before us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who’s there? You’re being impolite to us!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is… Kunai? Ninja Warrior!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Who are you?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I looked up, a woman was on the branch of a tree.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean no disrespect. But, you see, to give priority to Honey’s feelings I’m going to be an inconvenience and stop you here.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A mysterious black-haired woman. She seemed to be standing in front of us in order to impede our pursuit for the fleeing Earth… what kind of relationship does she have with Earth?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ho… honey?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s right. I…… met him the other day, and he showed me such charm as a man that I… fell madly in love with him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ha?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But I’ve only just met him. I don’t want to be thought of as a clingy flirt following him around on his journey to live freely in the moment. So all I can do now is support and help him from the shadows as a shinobi… that’s why, I will not let you go any further.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honey? Ha, h-h-honiii? Th, this person, th, this woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey… what are you saying… I don’t know what happened between you and Earth, but don’t scamper around my husband… Earth and I have been friends since we were little! Newcomers who came out later should back off!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She gives me the creeps. My guts are boiling over. A thieving cat was trying to put a wedge between me and Earth…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Husband? Since you were little… oh, I see… that’s what you mean…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re his first love, the one who’s still on his mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? That’s right!” [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufu, I see… that’s what you mean.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then the thieving cat looked at me and nodded as if she was satisfied with something, and snickered as if to ridicule me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No matter how much I’ve fallen for him, I still just met him. If there’s a woman he’s had long-standing feelings for and can’t forget… if that woman would make him happier than me… I was thinking of silently stepping aside, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wha? Wh-what the hell?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be very rude, but… surely, you are a beautiful woman, breasts are so-so… but, fufu, the thought that you could win at all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth was getting farther away due to this strange pause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, even if I ignore this woman here, she will continue to stand in the way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s an enemy that must be struck down right here and now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Earth became so popular… before I knew it …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Little man…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, this is not the time to be involved with such a person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, my instinct as a woman are telling me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “It can’t be helped. Mother…… I’ll stay.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh well… about the first love stuff and all that, seems there’s been some weird misunderstandings…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I can’t run away from this woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And it’s neither Lady Mamu nor Sadiz who should defeat her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The two of you, chase after Earth. I will take care of this.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”No!? Princess!?””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 They are hesitant to go ahead without me, but they can’t say so.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is an order! We can’t afford to lose sight of Earth! That’s why you have to go ahead and catch him! I’ll punish this cat and catch up soon!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ku, Princess, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who do you think I am! If we let him get away, it’s all for nothing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, at least I’ll stay… whatever the circumstances, we can’t have leave the princess on her own.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll do it! No, I have to do it! Quickly, go! You’re going to lose sight of him! This is a battle of pride not as a princess, but as a woman!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, gah… U, understood, princess, but be careful! Don’t overdo it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I emphasized that this was an order and let the two of them go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold it, no one’s going ―――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. You will never go near Earth again.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Imperial Spear • Agrestic Spearhead!! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I let fly a thrust of my spear, similar to wind pressure, and she avoided my attack.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I see, it seemed she’s a little capable, this woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wind Art!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “【Unveiled Hidden Romance Jutsu! 】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, to attack while evading? Magic? No, I don’t feel much magic power.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Wind?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, it was only a light breeze being blown at my feet… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, s-skirt… ku, what the hell are you doing?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My skirt was rolled up a little.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, since the opponent was a woman, it doesn’t matter if she sees my underwear in the least…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh… not white…… for the most part, his taste is restrained.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu!? Wh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What’s more, high-quality silk… I wonder if she’s a proper lady. They said she was a princess, but, not entirely…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, hey, wait a minute! Why all of the sudden…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth’s taste? Wh, what do you mean?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Do you not know? His favorite underwear is white… by the way, the other day, he had a look at mine.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Earth, panties!? N-no, ma-maybe he has seen mine, without me realizing they could be seen… but yeah, does Earth like white… I, I just happened to wear black today, but… no no, more importantly, Earth and this woman, wha, what’s with looking at panties other than mine!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Punishment is necessary after all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But on the other hand, me and Earth were too platonic. Or rather, I do not show such openings so much, so maybe that’s why Earth is messing with smutty books.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, then, I don’t mind showing you my panties, if that’s the case.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nununu, panties … as it is, Earth may get a nosebleed and ravish me… but if it happened, it would… mfufu. [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, rather than that, I should focus on the indecent woman in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. A woman with dreams beyond her station… you’ll learn to the depths of your pores just whose man you’re trying to make a move on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fall to obscurity as soon as possible. I’ll put to rest the ghosts of the past that torment him.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We can’t compromise with each other. We who collided with such feelings……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’ll at least ask your name first. What’s your name?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Shinobu Stoke.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so. I’m ――――”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I know. You’re…… the woman in his thoughts, Sadiz.” [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… huh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh…… huh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…wrong…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, why did she mistake me for Sadiz?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”………………………””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, why are you so surprised with that vacant look?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or rather, what a ridiculous misunderstanding?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, in any case, Earth is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Either way, Honey is…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We immediately regained our composure and prepared for each other.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Mine!!””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, mutually refusing to concede, we clashed with each other… it was then.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nay… THAT ONE IS MINE”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eh… eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Know thy place… Little Human Lasses”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I lost consciousness at that point.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s hot. I can’t stand Cool Biz, Super Cool Biz, or my usual naked Biz.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s so hot that the head does not work. Therefore, it was because of the heat that I had forgotten the princess’s name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] WRONG!!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Yeah, Shinobu’s right! Nothing Princess-like here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Again, WRONG!!!
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
