 “Kuh, kill me!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I remember it still.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Down to the last second, how long since we first met, and how long my servitude to him?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that first encounter, I was but a foolish little girl, yet to know of naught.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The great sinner that looked up to the incompetent Odin, who never showed voice or visage as a Deity, and raised arms to the true God, foolish of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was I, as a Valkyrie in the Heavens.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Never will I yield to demons!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 ‘The Kingdom of the Clouds, Angela Kingdom’ has existed since times of old, a realm inhabited only by our tribe, the Seraphs. They, in essence, did not interfere with the Surface world.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Legends. Fairy tale. A paradise of beautiful goddesses, their wings flapping. Many are the tales spread on the Surface, but such a world truly exists.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Born on the clouds, raised on the clouds, taught on the clouds, conceive on the clouds, live on the clouds, and die on the clouds. That was us, the Seraphs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that the war between the demons and the Surface world would intensify, and its influence reverberate to the heavens was cause for concern. Hence I believed the war ought to end soonest, and stormed the Demon Realm for the head of the Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why assail the Demon Realm? Because “The Demon King is evil” was the breadth of my wisdom.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Therefore, it was the evil demons who wage war, invade the Surface World and spread their malice. As the purveyor of such acts, defeating the Demon King would place me on the side of Justice. My role, I believed, was to be God’s instrument.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, after vanquishing hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the Demon King himself appeared before me, and against his overwhelming power, I, for the first time in my life, suffered defeat.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~… did you cut a strand of my hair… tis an accomplishment in itself. As expected, you have a ‘good eye’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A single strand of hair. I prided myself as the strongest, yet for all my power, I could only inflict that much on the Great Demon King, and nothing more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The world mightiest, I believe myself to be, an apostle of God, hence my pride laid shattered and I await death’s summon.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, that One said to me as I crawled on the ground.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, a little Seraph girl as a Valkyrie… intellect beyond human wisdom, still young and beautiful, the power to fully rout the Demon King Army… tis regrettable… such great promise, may eventually influence the fate of the Demon King army and the Demon Realm as well, but I am to crush such a possibility…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shocking were the words to me as I thought I was to die, but determined not to plead for my life at least.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Beautiful” and “regrettable” the Demon King said. Any clear-headed person would understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, transcending the world, his race, and all the barriers, he fell in love with me, The Demon King did.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Curious I once was about the Demon King’s true gender, but it doesn’t matter anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, in his position as the Demon King and mine as his enemy, he cannot show mercy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What love tragedy!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even back home, my only interest was improving myself, so to be clear, I had no experience with romance.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Women longingly gaze at me though of same gender and call me “Elder sister”, and the rancid filthy men approached me, but I paid them no mind.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, I couldn’t imagine associating with those weaker than I.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, different it was with the Demon King. Stronger than I am. Nay, the very first being I’ve come across in my life that was stronger than me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, for such an existence to fall in love with one such as I. How could such be so lamentable?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I cannot accept those feelings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I’m a Valkyrie. This body and soul are dedicated to Father Odin, the Great God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Odin… if you are to die some unseen figure, so be it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Jealousy of Odin! My dedication to Odin has brought forth jealousy in The Demon King.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, this heart of mine throbbed. And concurrently, my thoughts were swayed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why did I devote myself and my heart to Odin in the first place? In my home, Odin is our God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, never have I met him, never have I seen him, never have I heard his voice. However, because my parents and kin worshiped him as “God” and I was educated so, it was only natural that I did the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But, upon consideration, never has Odin done anything for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What meaning is there in such an existence? In Odin? Is it not a parasite that, despite being an incompetent that contributes nothing, continues to deceive by brainwashing education from times of our ancestors and attempts to settle in our hearts and minds?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the other hand, here before me stands one who is stronger than me and has affection for me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he struggles with all manner of obstacles and situations, and tries to conceal his heart as he fights the world for his companions, races, and the Demon Realm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Realizing the too precious nature of such a figure, I was moved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Be at ease. Thou… Thou need not suffer so much.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Thou need not be jealous of that froth Odin.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the Demon King would not be able to take me away with his own hands and make me his woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the only way to be with him was to stand by his side.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I won’t plead for life… but…… Great Demon King… allow me to be thy right arm.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Heh.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My proposal surprised even the Demon King. Well, in the end I was accepted, after various encounters with fastidious aging veterans.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Naturally, in the Demon King’s Army, I started as lowly infantry.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, I did away with my rivals and rose to the rank of General in but a few years.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the midst of the war, still enthralled by dross Odin’s deceit, my former kin tried to steal me back, but they were all routed. Such bitter and sorrowful voices from ones I’ve shared much with, my former comrade, underlings, elders, brothers and sisters, and… my own parents, but particularly, I felt no hurt in my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Compared to the charm of the Demon King, they were but dregs. On the contrary, my despair was in the opposite sense.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Was time spent with such incompetents wasted, I wondered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, after all, the scum called Odin never appeared despite all that was done to the Seraphs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Truly, an insignificant society and race.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Seraphs… are no apostles of God… long ago, white-winged avian harpies and other beasts ‘mixed’ among the humans, and evolved… however, the fellowship was persecuted by the people of the past, and those capable of powerful magic used clouds and created a world, a paradise for only the winged people… and handed down lore claiming to be Apostles of the God Odin to comfort themselves … that is all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Revealed the truth was one day, one that even I didn’t know.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Imposters, they were all along.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… so, until I met you… was but a pretender… ha, haha… what wasteful days…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Learning the truth, though I had no longing for my family or home, I felt despair.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, he said to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If you think that everything was meant to shape who you are today… the days that seemed useless will not be in vain…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Without a doubt, anyone can do it if they simply believe. However, tis not easy to fight and risk your life with such feelings. As a result, if your existence fostered strength, not all of it would be in vain.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Great Demon King…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And… depending on your situation, there will be various opinions about whether or not your actions were right. However, now that you have come to our side, the number of demons and soldiers who would be casualties of war has been decreased significantly… the lives of many demons were saved and protected… I have no choice but to admit that tis an undeniable fact.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Those were the words that saved my heart.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A truly free love. An infinite vessel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I understood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Nay. It’s no longer love, it’s nothing so low anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Convinced I was that he is “God”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This is the ‘God’ worthy of dedication and servitude.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was no longer worship.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I fight for God and die for Him with my all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My entire existence is for God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the same time however, there was also anxiety.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 God is the unique being. But what then if something were to befall God?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 God does not beget children like the horses and monkeys around him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 God has been an absolute existence for a thousand and ten thousand years, and I will continue to protect Him from all threats.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, one in one billion. One in one trillion. The possibility cannot be dispelled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Above all, God may have a lifespan.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so, the world will lose God.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That alone is unacceptable.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So I advised.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The Next God ・ Creation Project.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But God said, “Nonsense”, and refused my counsel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The word of God is absolute. Therefore, if God says so, it is natural to obey.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But there I choose not to follow.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because I worship God, I didn’t think my plan was folly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But if God was not to have a child, I must devise another way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the required material was already present to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Ancient Forbidden Magik from the destroyed city of Sorcery, Shiznautmy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Both my eye’s ‘Heraldic Eye’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Residing in my talisman, the ‘Hair’ from my first encounter with ‘God’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Using it I ――――
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I wondered if the hero, Hiro’s foolish act of destroying God would stain the world with despair, but… after all, my scheme was right…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 15 years have passed since God’s destruction.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 During that time, to avoid the eyes of the Allied Forces, the Seven Heroes, and the Demons who turned on us, ‘We’ remained in hiding, but the time has finally come.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s why all that was needed was the ‘Final Key’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, finding one worthy of being that Final Key proved most difficult.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But fate smiled upon us.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only the Heroes, but the children of the Seven Heroes, will eventually pose a threat to ‘us’. To confirm their power, the previous match held in the Imperial City was monitored through magic crystal, but I never expected the ‘Final Key’ would be there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In order to make the Final Key, I even trained a talented young lad, but it didn’t matter anymore.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even though he wasn’t under my tutelage, lo and behold a ‘man’ wielding the power of the ‘Demon King’ appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How that man was able to use the power of the Great Demon King, I do not know. However, such a thing should be examined at a later time. It’s a small matter in front of the fact that the power of the Great Demon King was used. No matter who the man is related to.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whatever may happen, it will be in my possession.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, in any case, Earth is… Mine!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Either way, Honey is… Mine!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All obstacles that flock will be scattered.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nay… THAT ONE IS MINE”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”Eh… eehh!!??””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Know thy place… Little Human Lasses”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And…… that is ours.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… these little girls do not matter… the problem is… Mamu…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 By no means, fate added Mamu to the proceedings. This may prove troubling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It can be settled here, but I cannot afford to allow the key’s escape in the meantime.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, the magik of the Breakthrough runs low.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, that doesn’t seem to be able to use ‘Magic Breathing’. Or does he not know of it?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In any case, they will soon catch up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No choice……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “If that’s the case… the consumption of magik is vast, but… to secure the key… must I ‘warp’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Key and Mamu, soon I’ll catch up.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The ancient magik used since times when ‘we’ were once on the run from our pursuers…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “ᛇᛂᛇᚺᚢᚾᛃᚺᚫᛐᛍᚺᛁᛈᛐᚭᛇᛁᚾᚴᚫᚾᛇᛂᚾ… Long-distance Transfer Magik, 【JǢRU】”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, with the key unaware, I absorbed him into space-time of my creation.
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
