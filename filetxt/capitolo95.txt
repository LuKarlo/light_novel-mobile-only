<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, I didn’t know what happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the breakthrough ran out, my magic power was gone, my physical strength had been drained and fatigue from the battle against Toulowe and Bro had reached its limit.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Mother and Sadiz chasing after me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As my legs were about to stop at the sound of their voices calling to me, I was swallowed up by a black vortex that appeared right before my eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some kind of magic? The power of mother or Sadiz? It seemed that Tre’ainar was screaming something just before, but now I don’t know what it was.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was so exhausted that I couldn’t resist anymore and left myself to the whirlpool, and before I knew it, I found myself far from conscious.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell was that …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… wh … what’s going on?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, when I realized it, I woke up again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A fluffy bed on my back. Warm sheets. And an unfamiliar ceiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I sat up and looked around the room, it reminded me of the infirmary in the academy building.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Is this a medical office?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… did I, get caught? I mean… it can’t be … the Imperial City?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If so, it’s the worst.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But my prediction was soon disproved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, tis not. Tis far from the Imperial City. Not even… in the Empire.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, hiya.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『You have slept quite a lot. Well, it means you used that much of your power…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Beside the bed was Tre’ainar, who was sighing, ‘finally awake’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But, it’s not the Empire? What happened to me? What’s that vortex?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That… there is so much afoot… and you… if I do say so myself… tis going to be quite the nuisance.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was stretching out my drowsiness, Tre’ainar, with a strange expression, suddenly said that to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Involuntarily, I was surprised and woke up at once.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What do you mean?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『First of all. Just before you were caught by Mamu and the maid, you were transferred far away by that woman’s magic… that was the vortex.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh? Wh, what? T-Transferred?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. To be clear, movement through space-time is super-high grade magic, above “giga-class”…… and forbidden due to its magical property to twist space and time.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wa, wai, eeh? S-Space? So, this really isn’t the Empire? And who would do that? Don’t tell me… was it Shinobu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis not that shinobi. And…… tis more troublesome.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You think it’s more troublesome than Shinobu? A woman more troublesome than Shinobu is in this world… No…… But…… Shinobu is a pretty nice person, isn’t she?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 How should I put it, who it is… Tre’ainar’s… acquaintance? Someone you know?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Besides… there’s…… mom and… Sadiz, that…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m worried about this, but what about those two?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I know not what happened, but… well, there should be no problem. That one may have a grudge against Mamu, but she will not take revenge at the moment. Tis surely why she kidnapped you with such great magic.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, k-kidnap… I … was I kidnapped?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Ah…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Who was it? Who brought me, and where in the world am I?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『That is… hnn?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar and I noticed a presence approaching this room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Presences… Two of them…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, upsy daisy… sorry, barging in yo. Oh, you’re up!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……Un……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had been bracing myself, but suddenly suffered disappointment as if I had lost my strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Two women dressed as nuns opened the door of the room and came in… no, women were women, but… compared to me they’re both…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, nice to meet you. Name’s ‘Karui’! I’m 13 years old attending the Cacretale School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! And, I serve as a sister of the church at times, a straight neat and tidy maiden!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I thought she was younger than me, that’s exactly right. Two years younger. Also cheerful and noisy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had short cut red hair, a happy-go-lucky, over-familiar attitude and got touchy without warning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “……’Amae’…un”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A little girl was peeking at me while hiding behind Karui.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s trying to hide her eyes under the nun outfit’s deep hood.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, she muttered what seemed to be her name, bowed to me with a blank look, and immediately hid behind Karui.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nahahaha, no~, I’m sorry. This one is shy, but if you get used to it or allow her heart to open up, her attitude will change, so do your best to open your heart!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, Karui laughed as she stroked the head of a small child named Amae.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, do your best. No, no, no, before that.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, wait… there’s a lot going on, but… first, where are we? Why am I here? So, what are you? …… hey, wait a minute. Come to think of it, you… just now… ‘Cacretale’……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, the first step is to confirm the situation. There were so many different “what” I couldn’t get it all straight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, that’s right. If we talk about the country… this is the Country of Cacretale. And this is the infirmary of the Great Church in the capital.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Ca, Cacretale!? That’s the big, isolated island nation!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes, that’s it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, then, isn’t it bad for me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cacretale. I’ve heard it, if just the name.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An island country floating in the sea of the Surface World.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A country that had little to no interaction with other countries and was therefore cut off from information.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the past, they did not participate in the Allied Forces, which was created by the rallying of most human nations in the war with the Demon Realm, and resisted the Demon King’s army on their own.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it was a secluded country, sneaking in was a punishable offence, and you would not be allowed to set foot in the country without permission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I’m in that country, right?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, for the time being, I don’t get it either, but it’s okay because the ‘High Priestess’ brought you in, right? In this country, where the civil war has ended, the High Priestess has the most power.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… The High Priestess?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess? What’s more, there was a terrible civil war… wait a minute…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, such is the way of things.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””Eeh!!??”””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No need to be hesitant. Well…… I’d be at a loss if thou lingered on without improving thyself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, I was about to get a headache for a lot of things, but soon all my thoughts were blown away, and when I noticed, I was standing on the bed, reflexively bracing myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh, ah…wha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, that’s a good response. That’s fine. Were I an enemy, thou might have died had the guard been a few seconds slower…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sweat spouted all over my body in an instant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a beautiful woman.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She had long black hair and a voluptuous and attractive body covered with a black priestess’ uniform.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In her hand, she held a shining scepter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At first glance, she gave the impression that she’s just a ‘beautiful and sexy woman’, but I was so on guard.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was because my body reacted to the strange power I felt from the woman in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “W-Who are you …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Strong. And more terrifying than anyone I’ve ever met… much more than Mr. Aka… deep and dark.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I… The High Priestess… shall give you my real name eventually, Earth Lagann.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, my name… ah, that’s right… so you’re the one who brought me here with that vortex magic?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Indeed.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… You’re kidding… hey…… that…… my mother and…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Worry not. Mamu and I have much that binds us, but I didn’t do anything.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Really…… I wonder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I glanced at Tre’ainar, he was looking at the woman with a serious face and his arms folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, do you know Tre’ainar?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, this person… doesn’t seem to be human…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, do rest up for a while. However, as I said before, I don’t want thee to linger too long. Thou were brought to this country because I need… something of thee.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Wha, eh, what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Until then, thou should reside in this church. As for thy personal affairs, Karui and Amae who are here … Hmm? Say, Karui… what has become of ‘Tsukshi’?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, all of a sudden? You want me to do something? And there’s still another woman in this church…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I think sister is probably at the dojo, right? I’m sure she’s still trying to give her favorite ‘Machio’ a healthy meal or something like that …… if Machio, who doesn’t know about the ‘supplementary prize’, wins ‘that competition’ …… they won’t end up together… it’s such a sad fate, but… wait a minute! High Priestess, you just said that he can stay here!? No, no, no, this is a maiden’s garden!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hh… Don’t say that. This one has special permission. Above all…… this man… could be the cupid that binds Machio and Tsukshi. This one… at least for the moment…… is already stronger than Bro.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Eh!? Oh, that’s right!? No, no, no, seriously!? More than Mr. Bro!? Well, I was wondering what would happen after Bro left, but seriously?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Suddenly, I got excited.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What the hell is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Do you also know Bro?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Karui, with her eyes shining, stared at me, and Amae also looked at me with a flash of interest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t know what it was, but the High Priestess smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In three months’ time… a tournament will be held in this country. The ‘Arcane True Zenith Fighting Competition’………… I will ask thee participate in said tournament and win the championship. Until then, thou will not leave this country. Well, I have taken numerous measures to prevent thy escape, but…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha!!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The winning privilege of the championship is an ‘enormous treasure’. And, a ‘Supplementary prize’. Well, the winner will receive the supplementary prize as well. Only I and my church as overseers of the tournament are aware of it… something amazing… a tremendous honor… do look forward to it and give it thy all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Arcane True Zenith? True Zenith…… that’s what Bro was using… no, a tournament? And the winner? Why would I do that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean… why would I ever do that when I was brought here without consent?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not good…… I can’t organize anything in my head, and I can’t even retort.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I feel that the introduction is finally over and the story begins in earnest.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The theme of the new series is “Even if a warrior from another country or a magic school appears in the new world, if you look down on a person without knowing what you’re doing, you’ll make a harem, and the author will shave his head and apologize.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This summer, not only measures against poor health from the heat, I will do my best to be careful not to become greasy.
