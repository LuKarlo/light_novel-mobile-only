 I didn’t understand what she was saying to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In the first place, why should I participate in such a tournament?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, this from a suspicious person who kidnapped me without permission.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, if this was a secluded nation, it’s doubtful that I’d really be able to sit around and relax in here.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm … still wary as expected. But…… thou ought to reconsider attempting escape with the breakthrough, right? A barrier surrounds this island at the moment… even with the Magic Spiral, thy current level is insufficient to break it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh… wh-what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had a long sleep and was able to fully recover my physical strength and magical power as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, I can trigger a breakthrough again.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This High Priestess in front of me must be quite powerful, but if it’s just to run away… as if seeing through my thoughts, the High Priestess disavowed it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s a barrier?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, prior to that, why does thou know the Breakthrough and the Great Magic Spiral!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s right. How do you know about my skills? Who the hell are you……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, I’ll inform thee another time. In the meantime, worry not. Train here for three months, win the tournament, and… help me with a little matter. That is all.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, hey, wait! There’s more! You said until I won the championship, but what do you mean by helping a little after that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This was the first time we’ve met. But I knew. She’s probably telling the truth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not about barriers or anything like that, just that they won’t let me go until their goal has been achieved.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Absolutely never let go.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That mood was conveyed from every word.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “To begin with, what’s the point, that something-or-other tournament… why do I have to be in something like that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, the Arcane True Zenith Fighting Competition… a tournament where ‘men’ proud of their skills gather from all over this country to compete for power. As a man, there are no entry requirements for participation in the tournament. Be it students of the magick school, former rank and file soldiers of the kingdom, or even paupers. And, as the organizer of the tournament, it is my recommendation for thee to participate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…But, so…Why me…?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In fact, I tried to limit it to only practitioners of the Arcane True Zenith school, but then the ‘winner’ is almost certain to be ‘that Man’… in which case, I thought to allow entry to anyone, whatever their discipline, so the door was opened to all besides those involved with the Arcane True Zenith. It was the right choice.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Normally, I would have resisted, saying, ‘Even if I’m told I can’t escape, I’ll try to see if it’s true’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I couldn’t take action, and all I could do was throw verbal jabs.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, I could tell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She’s strong… if I’m unlucky… at the level of the Seven Heroes…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, at that time.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Please do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hn!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui and Amae firmly clasped my hand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I want big brother to participate in this tournament and prevent a man from winning the championship! It’s about a woman’s love!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, they held on with their feverish hands and begged me seriously.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, love? What’s that about…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, and by the way… do you have a girlfriend or something, big brother?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ha? Wh what the heck, all of a sudden…n… no, I don’t.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Shinobu professed her feelings, but we still haven’t gone out or anything like that… the matter with Sadiz was painful, so let’s not trudge up that memory.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But what does the tournament have to do with love?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Besides, whether I have a girlfriend or not…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Really? In that case, there’s no problem! Yes, yes, that was ideal! Then, you might be pleased with the supplementary prize, too… Then I want you to do your best!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Good luck…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I was being wholeheartedly supported by them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, I don’t understand the situation well, but at great pains, I was growing accustomed to them.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t want to get caught up in a mess that I don’t understand.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm… Although…… as things are, winning the tournament is ‘absolutely impossible’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Nu?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I thought I would somehow get out of this place and somehow managed to escape the barrier of the Great Priestess, she said words as if to try me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although it was too simple a provocation, it was not easy to hear.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…What was that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Just as I have said. I had the privilege of watching thy match through the magic crystal. There certainly were some highlights. But currently… victory is impossible… that’s why, do put in the effort.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was simply as good as saying that I wasn’t strong enough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But at the same time I was wondering.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… I don’t know what it is. In the first place, why do you want me to win so much? Somehow, when I win the championship, ‘something unpleasant will follow’…… wouldn’t you think?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why are you invested in my victory?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the High Priestess shut her mouth a little to my question, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu… no choice then…… how is thy body?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? No, not particularly…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then I’ll have thee join me in the chapel for a moment.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the High Priestess went out the door.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui and Amae followed after her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I raised my vigilance to the maximum for whatever comes and followed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This country of Cacretale has been isolated for over a century, except for a few…… it’s a closed and strict country, only the ‘privileged ones’ or ‘those permitted to traverse its borders’ possess information about the outside. Even those few, though, have been conditioned through various means so as not to leak inside information to the outside…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess walked down the hallway to the chapel and told me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “However, the inhabitants of Cacretale are not simply ignorant, peaceful islanders, they have a long history of civil warfare, including skirmishes… in short, the country’s inner affairs and shame have been hidden for years so other countries remain unaware.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Civil war. I don’t know that much, it hasn’t been taught in academy classes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui said such a thing a little while ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But the civil war is over. The old regime brought low… and the ‘Founder God’ sides with us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Founder?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the High Priestess opened the door at the end of the corridor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a spacious church chapel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the high ceiling, stained glass windows and ceiling paintings of angels reminiscent of holiness.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And in the chapel, there were a lot of seemingly ordinary people who came to pray.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “High Priestess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “O High Priestess.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “So Beautiful today as well…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When the people noticed the presence of the High Priestess, their eyes lit up and gave joyous expressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Everyone is enthusiastic today, too…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes. It’s all thanks to God that we, who were suffering from oppression, can live in this way …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, your prayers of gratitude, certainly they have reached God.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, thank you…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Isn’t this attitude different from before? Until a while ago, you were trying to get me into a fighting tournament, no questions asked, but now you have a tremendous expression of compassion.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Great Priestess… today … is the ‘Goddess’ present?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The Goddess is resting in her room now. Hopefully she will be able to attend the upcoming congregation. At that time, you may worship the Goddess’ precious visage.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well! The upcoming congregation! I understand! I’ll come without fail. Oh…… what great fortune! To be able to worship the honorable face of the Goddess who saved us.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So… Goddess? What? Again, I got a word I didn’t know at all, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… ah… is that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu-oh!?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And I found an ‘outrageous item’ on the altar of the chapel.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So outrageous, even Tre’ainar was startled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There stood a bronze statue made in the image of a certain person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, well, somehow… that person, or rather…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fuh, do behold… young man.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, the Great Priestess, who noticed my situation, smiled.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That… The statue of the Founder God that is now spreading throughout Cacretale… whose true name is so sacred, we cannot even allow it to be uttered… The Works, Teachings, and Creed of the Founder God inspired this country’s people and brought the civil war to an end.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, that reputation sounds extremely forced.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 This person, knowing what I know of the one the statue resembled, what a daring thing to say.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, the person in that statue is …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 …… Really?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『No, hold on. Tis wrong. I have nothing to do with this… Or rather, apologies. I cannot even process anything right now. Please give little time…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 When I asked the person whose image the statue was of, Tre’ainar, the person in question, was holding his head and pondering something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yes, on the altar was a statue of a person resembling Tre’ainar.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Why?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… on to the next.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh? ah, well, already? I mean, where?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess told us to go to the “next” without giving us time to think about the situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, what’s next?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What, it’s close by… a facility right across from this church… is a dojo where thou can learn about the work of the Founder God…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “D, dojo?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Um. The Arcane True Zenith Dojo…… Conarmy City Headquarters. By the way, there are various branches, such as The Gord branch, Zabers branch, Mechros branch, and so on… Well, come along.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That said, I’m the one who’s been pushed around from the beginning.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Even Tre’ainar is still holding his head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After all, what is this woman all about?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But all I can say for the time being is… as I stepped into the dojo and the atmosphere of the dojo…… no, I saw the ‘equipment’ installed in the dojo that Tre’ainar had never seen before… my tension was elevated and once again I’m about to train.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Yesterday, the author’s concern was more about shaving hair rather than the impressions of the work… and I’m not going to shave, okay? I just said that I would shave if I made the “that kind of development” that I explained last time, but I’ll do my best not to make it “that kind of sh*t development”, so I’m not going to shave?
</div>
