 Leaving the church, I went outside and saw the paved road in front of me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Each square cut stone was evenly embedded in the ground, and buildings were lined up on either side of the large, spacious road.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because it was a secluded nation, I thought it would feel more like a developing country, but it seemed I took them lightly.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, it’s close by.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was fascinated by the state of the city, the High Priestess called to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There was a large three-story building directly opposite the huge and artistic church.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s the Arcane True Zenith or something Dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Honestly, I set foot in the dojo with little interest, wondering why I was quietly following her.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And then……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Master…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey there Master…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Master!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment I opened the door and went inside, a sudden gust of heat came upon my face.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The heat was completely different inside than outside, probably because of the steam.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And there…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “”””Osu!!!!””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Men? These guys also say that… such men.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Some were about my age, and others old and bearded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Everyone was covered in sweat, had well-trained bodies, and had a very strong impression.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, don’t strain thyself.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess responded to all of them with such a cool face……Hmm? Master?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Nu!? Th-This is… as for that…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And beside me, while I was fascinated by the people in the dojo, Tre’ainar was more focused on the equipment on the ground floor of the dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What was it? I’ve never seen that before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, rings were attached to the left and right of a long stick, and it was lifted up while clenching teeth with a very serious face. Was it heavy?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There are such similar tools everywhere, and some people are flying around with ropes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What’s more, there are huge mirrors all over the walls… Hey, it’s even bigger than the mirror I saw in the princess’s room when I was a kid?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Magical Bench Press… Magical Jumping Rope… Oh, Magical Squats… Magical Pull Ups… moreover the mirror… Hoh~』 [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For some reason… Tre’ainar’s eyes were sparkling… somehow, he’s squirming…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Hey, wait a minute, what’s that?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm? Oh, oh … that is …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A person was sitting on a device with wheels on the front and back, moving his legs to turn the wheels. However, the wheels do not go forward because they are fixed to the floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 What is the point of the thing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm, is it thy first time seeing this? That… is called a Magical Bike.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “B, Bike?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Simply put, thy legs can be trained by exercising for a long time.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is, is that how it works?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, seriously? Those names sound like something Tre’ainar would have given…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The ground floor is a Magical Training Room, it is open to the public for free. There are also rooms that train Visual acuity and a swimming pool in the backyard. It would benefit thee to come at any time and train with as many instruments as thou would like. Ask them how to use it. They’ll show thee how in a refreshing manner.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had to admit, I’m quite interested in it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 All of them are equipment that I’ve never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, everyone training their body by using them all have moderately good girth.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “He~… su.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I still don’t know why I’m in this situation.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But I’m starting to enjoy it a little more.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Until just a while ago, I was worried about my mother and Sadiz…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… My Goodness…… tis inadequate.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, however, Tre’ainar, who was very lively, stood with his arms folded and a scowl.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis certainly training in its own way… However, I have never used such equipment! The people here do not know how to really train efficiently! Goodness, to bench press, properly bend the elbows and place it on the chest. Nu, over there, that should be raised with momentum to lower recoil… the hips float too much, as well! Those squats are not in a proper posture, either… In such case, he will simply tire out and hurt his back!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, he had a scowl, but it’s a scowl that’s made when you’re getting all excited… [2]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『If one originally lacking muscle strength exercises, muscle strength will be gained at first. But! To train to a certain level and beyond, naturally the right training regimen is needed! In this case, all that can be trained is your guts! Do not adopt this… she is called Master, but ‘that one’ does not understand. After all, they are simply imitating my form and spreading it as knowledge… Even though such an environment exists with great care, the treasure is rotten… Fufufufu, as such, I will have to drill the child with the proper training from scratch… And three months until the tournament… tis just right. It still requires three months for the results of strength training and other effects to emerge… Fufufufu, I am itching to begin!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, although I approve of this environment, Tre’ainar seemed dissatisfied with the way they actually trained here, and that’s why I am very grateful and motivated to train with this fellow in the right way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, let’s go! That’s it, spread your legs wide, and one, two, go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””One, two, one, two!”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, the voice of a cheerful woman and a lot of women were heard rhythmically from a different room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Eh? What? What are you going to do with your legs spread out? Eh? I should probably check things out in there… Well, when I thought about that kind of thing, I’m amazed again by Tre’ainar…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “In that room, they’re doing Magical Aerobics to get in some exercise, rather than training. The sisters under my tutelage lead the sessions, and it is very popular with housewives and young women.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What? You even perform Magical Aerobics?!』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Tre’ainar, who’s in high spirits, doesn’t care what’s on my mind right now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, there seem to be a lot going on… and then there’s Tre’ainar and the High Priestess, who seemed to know each other… she’s dressed as a human being, but after all this woman is …
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Now, upstairs. The second floor is… a place to teach His Work…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, ooh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was expecting that, but once again I was fascinated by the space I saw for the first time on another floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Kia! Hit it Kia!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hit! Hit! Keep hitting the Magical Sandbag 100 rounds!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, u, uoh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hit a low kick, even if it breaks your leg!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was full of enthusiasm that was different from the first floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Unlike the refreshing air of the first floor, each person practices punching and kicking, and hits and kicks bags hung from the ceiling.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is where we teach the Arcane True Zenith Style… Punching, kicking, throwing, grappling, and various physical techniques are taught to each student trying to learn… the ones teaching here are the disciples I personally trained during the past civil war.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Hmm? Your disciples?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Once, I had received teachings of God, and I descended here with the Goddess and taught the Arcane True Zenith Style to those selected of the Revolutionary Army. Some fled due to its excessive harshness…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Not only a High Priestess, but she also took apprentices and trained them herself… somehow… she really is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『… The form always needs improvement… Surely, it looks like it’s done in its own way, but it lacks the power to resonate with the opponent’s core… Hmm, well, my hands are full with just the child, so I need not deal with them! …… Hmm? Hoh~, some of them are drinking raw eggs in a cup… Fuhahahahaha.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, after taking another glance at this space, Tre’ainar made a smug face, saying, “I could train more disciples if I wanted”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Or, I noticed by Tre’ainar’s words, but a guy taking a break had a raw egg… Oh, hey. What are you thinking, drinking raw eggs directly? [3]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『As usual… that one… is still naive… yet to release the tiger’s eye… still a long way to call it a tiger den.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In what way… Tre’ainar, I was confused when I saw the statue a while ago, but now there’s something else… what’s a tiger’s eye or a tiger den?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Incidentally, the third floor is the Magical Sparring Ground, where thou can engage in a mock battle. Thou could try thy skills with other disciples, sometimes with thy teachers…… Fufufu, how about it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then she told me about the facilities and asked, “What do you think?” The High Priestess asked for my impressions.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be honest, it was a dojo completely different from what I had imagined. In a good way.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, although the size is smaller than the training ground at the academy, there are a lot of unknown equipment, so it seemed somewhat interesting.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apart from the tournament, it might be interesting to train here…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes… train here…surpass ‘Machio’…… win the tournament… as the one who inherited the power of the Great Demon King… thou would be a worthy companion for ‘Lady Kron’…… fuh~, as for me, it doesn’t matter if it’s Machio, but although she is human, to have ‘Tsukshi’s’ maiden love end with a broken heart… it would pain me little.” [4]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Hmm? Somehow, the High Priestess was mumbling something, but … I couldn’t hear it well…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Magical Sandbag… hmm, yes… the child who had only trained in shadow and phantom sparring could further improve the quality of the punches here… now, what sort of schedule shall I craft? Hmm, what to do? What shall we do?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar also didn’t seem have heard it at all.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now that you’re here, you’re so cute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Somehow, I’m so excited, will I train here for a while?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Recently, I searched for a hair removal salon just in case… well, I’m not going.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S1] Okay, do they just put ‘Magical’ in front of everything. It’s like old sci-fi stuff putting ‘Space’ in front just because, well……space!!!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S2] Yeah, Tre’ainar is in his element.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S3] Probably a reference to [that one scene] from the Rock movies
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 [S4] Holupaminit, is all this an intricate, over-complicated hookup scheme?
</div>

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
</div>
