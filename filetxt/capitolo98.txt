 “Gahahahahahahahahaha, Master, you’ve brought along a very cute brat today!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was impressed when I saw the inside of the dojo, a big man appeared.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He wore shorts and a shirt that extended to his shoulders. He had a shiny bald head, and only grew a mustache, such an overbearing man.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 He’s a pretty muscular guy… [1]
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm. Instructor ‘Cadegha’…… How fare thy students?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, there’s still a long way to go. They’re all motivated to win the tournament in three months… huh, well, I am too, you know.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Dear me… how deplorable.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “But! Even if we can’t win the championship, we won’t lose to the soldiers of the old regime or the Magic School youngsters who know nothing of the civil war!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see…even if they couldn’t beat ‘Machio’, both the masters and the students would benefit from such motivation… I’m glad I opened the door to the tournament after all…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Muscular. Huge. He may have a decent amount of power and vigor, but he’s somewhere between the lower and middle-class Imperial warriors.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the High Priestess was too extraordinary, I was concerned about the level of the other teachers, but apparently the High Priestess was the only one in a different dimension.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No……it looks like… there’s one other person…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And, what of Machio?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Machio is out on Magical RoadWork… well, if I don’t have anything to teach him anymore, I don’t have anyone he can spar with…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Is that so… as expected, Machio will claim victory at this rate… well, as it is now, however…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And that’s…… who’s the youngster? A student from the Wizarding School? Doesn’t seem to be an orphan from the slums …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! He’s an initiate.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nu-wai-wha!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 No, no, no, I haven’t decided to join yet!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, Tre’ainar looked happy, so I think it’s okay to join, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Just join, Child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, uh, Tre’ainar?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Of course, you need not ask them to teach you, but… this facility may be utilized…』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Are you sure about this? In general, doing as I’m told seems irksome. I’m going to be sent to some weird tournament.」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Even so, tis fine. What matters is that by taking advantage of this environment now, your strength could increase dramatically.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「R, really?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Indeed! If you receive my proper training… fufufufu, I can barely wait to begin.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, Tre’ainar is completely up for it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe he’s already forgotten about the High Priestess’ plot, or why there was a statue of Tre’ainar, and so on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wait, Master! Recently, there are a lot of pansies who start out at first then run away after a few days, so we can’t deal with someone who doesn’t have the guts for it.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And before I replied, the bald man objected to the High Priestess.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even my decision?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I mean, when Bro brought his friends a few years ago, they immediately ran away, didn’t they? All the same, I must do some tests!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Test? …… Well, I don’t mind.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Apparently, regardless of my intentions, I need to take a test to be initiated into this dojo.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I haven’t answered yet, but Tre’ainar said that too, and… well, I should probably stand up for my master here?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wow. I’m going to use the facilities here. And? What test do I have to take?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoh~, pretty confident guy. However, recently, there are a lot of wimps who talk big then run away immediately… come on.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Hmm? Isn’t it sparring?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ghahahaha! Hey, I’m not going to bully a newbie like that.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, the bald man went down stairs to the first floor.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I don’t mind if it’s a spar. I think I can beat this bald man…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, even if the High Priestess brought him here, we don’t even know how strong big brother is… whether he’ll be sister’s Savior… I’m looking forward to finding out…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Un.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui and Amae look excited about my test.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the High Priestess was all smiles as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right… it will inspire the other students, and perhaps it’s best to know of the lad’s power…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Oh, she’s got a wicked expression on her face. I knew it, that High Priestess is pretty suspicious!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Later, I’ll have to ask Tre’ainar about this woman…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Okay, this is it. The introductory test is… Magical Bench Press.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Bench Press?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And what the bald man showed me as a test on the first floor, he called a bench press.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s like a narrow chair for lying down, and a long bar on top with a ring at both ends.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is a training device specific to the dojo, for strengthening the arms…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis nothing so vague as merely arms. Upper body…… Pectoralis major, triceps, deltoid, and so on. The main muscle focused on is the pectoralis major, and you can gain a robust chest.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the bald man went under the bench press first intending to give a demonstration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, Tre’ainar beside me added more to the bald man’s explanation as a ‘supplement’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This way, I lie on my back on the table, so that my face and arms come right under the weight of the ‘Barbell’.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Lying on the bench, take hold the bar. At that time, hold the bar with a slightly wider width than the shoulders.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “And, lift it up like this… Fununununununununu, Ndoryaah!! This way, lift the barbell and then lower it! Then place it on your chest once and then lift it again! In that case, the magic on this barbell…… is a mechanism that increases the weight according to the force put in to lift… that is, the power of the person… By the way, I’m at ‘120 Power’! Do this every day, and naturally your strength will increase!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A magical light was generated on the barbell, and ancient figures emerged. Is that ancient magic, too?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 According to the ancient figure, the number “120” is displayed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What… I never, do they take simple ‘Max measurement’ as training… they do not understand, this fellow… Bench press training should be raised and lowered multiple times…… at least 10 repetitions… Besides, this one, ‘Cheats’… he lowers the barbell and lifts with the recoil from hitting on the chest… unless you properly kill the momentum on your chest and then lift, tis meaningless.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While explaining it with a smug face, Tre’ainar exposed the bald man giving the demonstration.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 However, the ‘120 power’ seemed to be considerable, and the people training in the dojo raised impressed voices.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh, as expected, Instructor Cadegha…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I’m no match for Machio, but the power is top class of the Arcane True Zenith Style!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, that’s amazing. Well, it’s big brother’s turn next.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Go for it”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If anything, there’s even a round of applause. I don’t know if it’s such a great figure or not.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, the average figure for men is ’40 power’. In other words, my power is three times that of a normal person.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Saying that, the bald man smiles with his teeth shining.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So, I guess I’m next…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『In any case, for the child’s training, I will learn your Max figure as a reference… show me, child… you originally had a firm foundation, trained diligently, and repeated use of the breakthrough continued to put load on your muscles, so naturally your abilities have improved.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The people around me looked on with interest, and Tre’ainar watched over me with enthusiasm.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So for the time being, I’ll learn by imitation, and then try it with the “proper form” as Tre’ainar instructed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Lie on your back, take hold of the stick, and lift it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, nu, oh, heavy!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Obviously, tis Max setting. I shall adjust it later, but… for now, do not use the Breakthrough, just lift it with a full power burst.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Nugu, Gu, Nuoh, Oh, Oooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh!!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Does the weight change depending on my power? No, wait a minute… wouldn’t this be a great weapon if you figured out how to use it …? I clenched my teeth and used all my arm strength and even my broad back muscles, which I’m aware of when I punch, to lift the barbell.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uooooh, how’s thaaaaaaat?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “””””… Wha … Eh!!?? Hya……… 170!?”””””
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 170? Is that my figure? For the time being, it surpassed the bald man, and the people around him are surprised at the figure.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hoho, this is unexpected!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, that’s amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, I couldn’t lift this much at that young age!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Even though his physique is normal, it’s a big deal!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hey, seriously? No, even though it’s no match for Machio, it’s good enough!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “… Oh …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『I see… in other words, using the breakthrough… it could reach 200… well, at this point, tis a passing mark, child.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, let’s just call it a pass for now.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Puha… huh, is this okay?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh! That’s great, isn’t it, youngster? I don’t know where you trained, but you are one hell of a gem!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The bald man happily slapped me on the back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Anyway, this bench press…… it’s true that it easily quantified my current level, so it’ll show if I’ve improved later on.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hehe, I didn’t even realize it until now, but I’m pretty strong…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had more strength than a guy who is bigger than me. The fact felt a little pleasant.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis adequate. However, child, you gave a pretty good figure, but do not get swayed by it, alright? In the first place, bench press is simply a reference value, it does not equate to combat power. If the muscle mass is inflated unnecessarily, it could collapse the punching form and even become an obstacle. The ‘Supple muscle’ which is your character will become hard and your advantage will be lost.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Eh, is that so?」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis so. Therefore, the ideal is to train everything in a well-balanced and even manner. Even a punch is not solely dependent on the strength of the arm, but also strong legs and waist. Perhaps the people in this dojo simply do not understand.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 「Heh… it’s really a lot of work… getting stronger …」
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Such is the way of things. However, child. Tis a great opportunity. Let us use other instruments, squats and running power may also be measured. Tis no good to be focused on numbers alone, but tis still very useful to visualize your physical abilities numerically. That way, you know what physical abilities are lacking, and on the other hand, where your strengths lie.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And, Tre’ainar gave me instructions as soon as I passed the test.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, I was also interested in it, so I nodded and decided to give it a try.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See here, as the one Master brought along, he’s pretty impressive.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh. He’s no match for Machio, but he’s talented…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While complimenting me, people around me seemed to imply that I’m below a certain person…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 His name has been coming up for a while, but is this guy that amazing?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, as Tre’ainar said, if you don’t think this bench press alone will determine your fighting power, it’s nothing to worry about…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hmm?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then I saw a piece of paper on the wall beside the bench press.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The paper said ‘Bench Press All-Time Ranking’ on it, and at the top of it is…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… 1st place…… Machio Proteen……? …… 500 Power? ……?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was my first bench press and I found out that I was stronger than most other people, I was feeling good about myself. But that numerical value, felt like it was warning me ‘Don’t get cocky’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Author’s Note
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Because the unit of this story and the unit of reality are not the same, “170 power” is not “bench press 170kg”. Therefore, please excuse the retort that “the depiction of this power is strange at this level of bench press”.
