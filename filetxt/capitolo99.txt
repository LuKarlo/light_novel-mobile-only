 “Nuoh, oh, noh, oooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 An insane load on the waist… carrying a barbell and then lowering and lifting … Squats?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Be sure to tighten the waist as well as the legs. Yes, they assume that Magical Squats are only for training the lower body, but in reality they stimulate not only the lower body, but also the hips, back, abdominal muscles, and even the arms. Most crucial, it trains your core as well. In other words, it strengthens the muscles of the entire body. Also, the lower body is not so vague, but the exact parts are the thigh muscles… hamstrings, quadriceps, calf triceps, gluteus maximus, and so on.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Gu, m, moreover, this barbell on my neck, h-hurts…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Get used to it, youngster! Guts!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Tis a simply form. Keep your chest up and place the barbell your shoulders… on the top of the trapezius muscles, not your neck. Adjust the grip width and elbow angle a little more as well.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 While listening to Tre’ainar’s instructions, I’ll try to do as much as I can.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Whole body workout…… is indeed true. The stimulation of the lower body was quite tough, but normally stimulating the muscles of the whole body is also quite tough.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Magical Squat, 230 Power! No, that’s a big one! Are you really a beginner?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Impressive… Magical DeadLift is also 210 power… No, he’s a frightening lad.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 These also seemed to have been good figures in their own right.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, these figures are enough to place into the all-time rankings on the wall.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 But……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hah, hah … hey … this one in first place… they’re all the same guy, but… what kind of monster is that? They all more than double mine…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I think I’m getting a little stronger, but I’m not really proud of my strength.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As Tre’ainar said, these figures are just for reference.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Still, it’s impossible not to be concerned with someone who was hitting numbers that are incomparable to mine.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Machio is a bit of a… substandard monster.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Cacretale’s Most Powerful Warrior.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “With the exception of the Master, he is the strongest man in the Arcane True Zenith School.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The strongest of Arcane True Zenith Style…… Well, I guess that’s the way it is when hammering out such ridiculous figures.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Strongest…… though…… in this country…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Cacretale is an independent state that did not participate in the past war with the Demon King army.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 A guy like that was in such a country without making a name for himself? If you think about it…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『The strong yet unknown to the world… Aka as well… Bro is also of that group… so they exist… that is to say, outstanding hidden talents?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Certainly, there were quite a few strong guys that the world did not know about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Tre’ainar was also muttering while looking at the ranking table on the wall with his arms folded.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It seemed that, I’ve been in such a narrow world until now…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well… anyway, do you want to measure your speed? However, since speed is measured outside, how about you measure your ‘eyes’ first?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As I was a little depressed, old man Cadegha made the next suggestion to me.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 We measured my strength, so he said that the next measurement would be for the eyes.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The eye? Is it like a medical checkup, some kind of vision test?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, this way.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Come on, big brother, let’s go!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Keep it up, next.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 With that said, Cadegha invited me to the back room on the first floor, as Karui and Amae pushed my back.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 If I already came this far, I might as well follow him.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then we were led to a room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There were rows of round projections embedded in the walls of the room.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “What in the world is this?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『What!? You can even do Magical Vision training?』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “This is Magical Vision training.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Training with exactly the same name as what came out of Tre’ainar’s mouth as he exclaimed with excitement.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Now, at this point, the details don’t matter.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As soon as the training starts, these buttons will flash randomly with magic. When you press it, another spot flashes… you do this as fast as possible to see how many times can be done in 15 seconds.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『It maximizes the field of view and trains peripheral vision, kinetic vision, eye movement, instantaneous vision, deep vision, as well as reflexes and concentration.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s a little different from Magical Speed Reading… the buttons embedded in the wall flash one after another, and you have to press them quickly. Certainly, reflexes and concentration are also required.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I see. Amusing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I had a bit of hope that I could get a good figure myself.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My eyes should have been considerably trained by Tre’ainar and the actual battles so far.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 In addition, my punching speed should allow me to press the button faster than the others.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, you’re full of confidence… well then, Ready … Start!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Sha!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Release all the nerves and put everything into the next few seconds. Make sure the button flashes and then hit the button without pause.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Uoh, ooooh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hands, so fast!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Make full use of both hands and both eyes and hit with my full power…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s time!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “How is it?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I didn’t count myself in the middle of it. The movements of my hands were much faster than I could count in my head.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Si… Sixty times!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, no way!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “See here, it’s undisputed! Amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Sixty times. What level is that?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah! I’m pretty confident in this! Let’s see, that was … that was …!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I glanced around the room looking for you-know-what.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s the rankings.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “The first place in the ranking is… 51 times… Dinay Zut… Who’s this!? Where’s that Machio guy?!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I hadn’t noted any of the other names in the previous power rankings, so I didn’t know anyone else.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And the name of the guy called Machio wasn’t there.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, Machio is no good at such small details… Simply, his power is so great that if he hit a button, the wall would break and we couldn’t measure it…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “tte, he what now!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For the time being, I’m ranked number one in the current record. However, it seems that there are other circumstances involved as well.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I mean, I’m honestly not happy about it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, but this is amazing!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yeah, I don’t think Machio can get much of a record with this kind of thing, can he? A maiden’s mind is blunt.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Well, even if the measurement could be done, it seemed that Machio and others are not good at this kind of thing.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then, this is my win, so I guess I’ll take first place in the all-time…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Step aside.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, Master!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “High Priestess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that time, the High Priestess entrusted the scepter to Karui and prepared. And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Begin.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 She seemed motivated. What’s going on all of a sudden? At the same time as I thought, I realized something.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… What? Those eyes…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『…… Hmm…… to use those… tis foul play.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess suddenly revealed the crest that I had never seen before.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 For a moment, I thought it was a mistake, but they clearly emerged.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…!? What!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The next moment, something incredible happened.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess did not move her neck or eyeball at all, moving only her hands and hitting the buttons from her initial position.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Moreover, the moment the button lit up and the moment it was pressed are almost the same.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I confirmed that the button flashed before pressing it, while the High Priestess hit it as if she knew which button would flash next.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 As a result……
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “62 times… well, it’s what I think …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Eh!?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 My record…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Hold on, Master, you can finish it anyway…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right, High Priestess!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess pulled out even though there were ‘five seconds left’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “As a teacher, it doesn’t matter how vast a figure I give. There is a limit to how much I can flaunt the difference in strength to my students and motivate them.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess told us that with a nonchalant air.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It was such a shock that she shattered what I thought was ‘my win’.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, but apart from the Master, your record is awesome!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “That’s right. Your power and eyes are among the all-time highest!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was praised that way, but … honestly, I wasn’t happy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 And at the same time, I’m reminded of the person I was just a few days ago.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I was not able to defeat my childhood friend, I never got to the top of my class, and I was just a talented person.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “~~~, t, next! What should I do next?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 There’s no way I’m gonna lose!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At that moment, I was crying out to let me do the next event as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Haha, he’s a stoic one.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “You’re not satisfied with this at all… no way, so freaking amazing.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, next is speed!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ll do anything. And even one is fine. I want to find something where I’m second to none.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve been saying, sooner or later, I was going to be a big shot in the world with enthusiasm. but if I can’t even win a single record in a dojo in a country, in general, it’ll be nothing more than big talk.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Speed, oh, that’s good! Let’s do it!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I am confident in my speed. Thanks to having learned many steps, I am able to perform “sharp acceleration”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Then, the speed measurement is outdoors, let’s move outside.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Next time, for sure… that’s what I thought, but…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “By the way, Karui. Is it wise to be so carefree?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Yes? What’s going on? High Priestess”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Should thou not be in school by now?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Huh? ……”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The moment we went outside, the High Priestess suddenly asked Karui, in a “forced” manner.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Then Karui was a little dumbfounded, but soon her face turned blue…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I, I forgotーーー!!?? S, so late!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui, who had been flippant until a while ago panicked, and was in a great hurry to get going…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Ah, I’m going, I am going!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Immediately, she began running fast through the town… began…… running…… eh?
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, that Karui, in such a rush … to leave without changing into uniform…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The High Priestess laughed dismissively, but… hey, wait a minute.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Huh~… that little girl… has good legs.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Wh-what the hell, is that girl!? F, Flying…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Karui ran in a full dress. Her light feet jumped through the city, and the moment she saw the crowd, she jumped and climbed up to the roofs of the buildings and ran through while maintaining high speed.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 The run, which does not feel the effects of gravity, disappeared from sight.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’ve done Magical Parkour, I know what I’m talking about.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That’s not normal.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 That gait, is much better than the usual ninja warriors… it’s better than me…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Oh, by the way… that girl, Karui… though still a little lass… she’s the fastest in Cacretale…she was nicknamed ‘Weightless Sprinter Karui’…… now, the speed test…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…Nah… for now… I’m good…”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufu, that’s fine. Well, either way, thou has passed. Use this place to train thyself as thou wish.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 To be clear, it’s an overwhelming gait that I can see just by looking that it’s much faster than I run.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Maybe even faster than me using the Breakthrough…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It made me think that this is exactly what the unstoppable legs are.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 After being shown something like that, I didn’t have the spirit to attempt the test while she snorted, “take first place”.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Well, lad. I’m so sorry, but… Karui went ahead without a uniform and no textbook. Could thou bring them to the school?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “…… Huh? Why me?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “On the way, thou can take a tour of the city, right? Amae, show him around.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “No, even if you say that …”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I haven’t gotten over the shock yet, but the High Priestess suddenly asked me to be her errand boy.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 I’m told that I’ll also be given a tour of the city, but I don’t feel like it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 On the contrary…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Are you sure?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Of what?”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “I might immediately run away, right? Break through the barrier and stuff.”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 You can’t just give me free reign like that, right? I tried to ask.

 Then, as if the High Priestess had seen through everything…
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Fufufufufu, could you do it though? Nay, in the first place… if thou could escape as it is, why not do as thou would like?”

 If you can break the barrier, then break it.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Before that, if you don’t mind running away with this test result, then run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It sounded like she was saying that, and of course I had no choice but to accept that I couldn’t just turn my tail and run away.
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 “Damn it!!”
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 It’s pathetic. And I’m ashamed of myself. I thought I was much stronger than before…

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 Despite my frustration, I carried Amae on my back, and now I have no choice but to do as I was told.

<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 So…… once again…… I entrust myself in your care… Master!
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 『Naturally.』
</div>
<div class="mantine-Text-root mantine-1ekvxsp" id="chapterText">
 At the thoughts I muttered in my heart, my reliable Master nodded.
